# NOTIFICATIONS

This feature consolidates all real-time notification mechanisms into a single, unified module. It merges the functionality of outbound Webhook notifications and Server-Sent Events (SSE) into a coherent interface for external integrations, browser clients, and other monitoring systems.

## Overview

- **Unified Channels:** Provides dual notification channels over a single integrated interface. Clients can choose to receive updates either via configurable HTTP webhooks or via an SSE stream.
- **Configurable Options:** Users can enable one or both channels by setting environment variables. Webhook endpoints are specified through a comma-separated list (e.g., `WEBHOOK_URL`), while the SSE endpoint is available at a dedicated HTTP route (e.g., `/sse`).
- **Real-Time Updates:** Any key ontology operation (refresh, merge, update) triggers a broadcast to all connected clients. Each notification includes details such as the ontology title, version, timestamp, and a status message.

## Implementation Details

- **Notification Abstraction:** The notification service provides a single API for triggering messages. Internally, it dispatches messages to both HTTP webhook destinations and active SSE connections as appropriate.
- **Asynchronous Delivery & Retry:** Webhook notifications are sent asynchronously with basic retry logic and exponential backoff, ensuring robust delivery. SSE notifications are streamed continuously to connected clients with proper connection management (handling connection initiation and disconnect events).
- **Diagnostic Logging:** Enhanced logging is integrated. All notification attempts are logged with timestamps and status details to aid in monitoring and troubleshooting.
- **Configuration:** 
  - Environment variables such as `WEBHOOK_URL`, `WEBHOOK_RETRY_COUNT`, and `WEBHOOK_RETRY_DELAY` control the behavior for webhook delivery.
  - The SSE endpoint is fixed but can be updated via CLI flags if necessary.

## Benefits and User Impact

- **Simplified Integration:** External systems and browser clients benefit from a unified service, reducing the need for multiple integrations and separate connections.
- **Resource Optimization:** Consolidating the notification mechanisms reduces code duplication and ensures a more maintainable codebase aligned with the mission of delivering dynamic, live data-driven ontology management.
- **Flexible Client Options:** Consumers can select the notification channel that best fits their environment, enhancing overall system interoperability.

## Usage Example

1. **Configuration (for Webhooks):**
   ```bash
   export WEBHOOK_URL="https://example.com/webhook,https://another-endpoint.com/hooks"
   ```

2. **Running the Server:**
   Launch the CLI with the web server option (e.g., `npm run serve`). The unified notification service will initialize automatically.

3. **Client Integration (for SSE):**
   In a browser, use:
   ```js
   const evtSource = new EventSource('http://localhost:3000/sse');
   evtSource.onmessage = (event) => {
     const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
     console.log('Notification Update:', data);
   };
   ```

4. **Triggering Notifications:**
   Ontology operations such as updates or refreshes automatically broadcast a JSON payload (with fields `updatedOntologyTitle`, `version`, `timestamp`, and `statusMessage`) through the unified service.

- **CLI Command:** Add a new CLI flag (e.g., `--gen-issues`) within the main CLI dispatcher to allow users to trigger the issue generation process. The command will accept parameters for custom prompt or template names.
- **Prompt Template Management:** Provide a default prompt template that describes the repository context, current feature set, and implementation guidelines. Allow users to override this template via environment variable (e.g., `ISSUE_TEMPLATE`) or CLI options.
- **Logging and Diagnostics:** Integrate with the existing diagnostic logging mechanism to report API call status, any errors returned from the Chat Completions API, and a summary of the generated issues.
- **Output Format:** Return the generated issues in a structured JSON format that can either be directly submitted to GitHub or further processed to create issues via the GitHub API.

## Testing

- **Unit Tests:** Create tests to simulate various responses from the Chat Completions API, verifying that the module returns correctly structured issue objects given a descriptive prompt.
- **Integration Tests:** Ensure that when the `--gen-issues` CLI command is invoked, the output is a list of issue descriptions that match repository style guidelines, and that the diagnostic logs contain appropriate details.
- **Edge Cases:** Test behavior when the API returns errors, when invalid prompt parameters are supplied, and when custom templates are used.

This feature extends the automation capabilities of the repository, enabling efficient issue creation for iterative development while ensuring adherence to the repository guidelines and mission objectives.features/rejects/CUSTOM_ENDPOINTS.md
# features/rejects/CUSTOM_ENDPOINTS.md
# CUSTOM_ENDPOINTS

This feature enables users to extend and override the default list of public API endpoints through a unified configuration mechanism. Users can specify custom endpoints via the `CUSTOM_API_ENDPOINTS` environment variable, allowing for targeted data retrieval from additional verified data sources.

# Overview

- **Custom API Endpoints:** Enables users to supply a comma-separated list of URLs that extend or override the default endpoints used to build ontologies.

# features/rejects/CORE_ENGINE.md
# CORE_ENGINE: Unified Live Data, Diagnostics, Telemetry, Query & Recovery Engine

## Overview
The CORE_ENGINE remains the backbone of owl-builder and is responsible for integrating live data ingestion, anomaly detection, diagnostic logging, telemetry aggregation, and recovery mechanisms. This engine now features an enhanced environment variable parsing and telemetry batching subsystem that provides robust handling of configuration values, ensuring that non-numeric or malicious inputs are safely managed and logged.

## Live Data Integration & Anomaly Detection
- **Live Data Ingestion:** Continuously fetch data from trusted public endpoints with retry mechanisms, exponential backoff, and a caching layer to optimize performance.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Validate fetched data against expected schemas. Trigger detailed diagnostic messages and initiate automated rollback when anomalies (e.g., missing or empty `entries`) are detected.

## Diagnostics, Telemetry & Environment Variable Parsing
- **Enhanced Diagnostics:** Log every significant event with timestamped messages. Detailed logs include both successful operations and error warnings for immediate troubleshooting.
- **Aggregated Telemetry:** Batch and export diagnostic telemetry (including NaN fallback events) via CLI commands. Support for both JSON and CSV export formats is maintained.
- **Environment Variable Parsing:** Newly refined parsing utilities now normalize environment variables by trimming and collapsing whitespace, converting edge-case variants of 'NaN' (including " nAn " and non-breaking space variants) into a standardized form. Explicit non-numeric inputs are logged distinctly and fallback to default values, all while aggregating warnings to prevent log flooding.

## Live Data Caching, Backup & Recovery
- **Caching:** Implement an in-memory caching mechanism for live data fetches with a configurable TTL. Redundant API calls are minimized by reusing recent data while ensuring fresh fetches once the TTL expires.
- **Backup & Automated Rollback:** Regular backups are created and stored. On detecting data anomalies, the engine attempts to restore the last known good backup, with real-time WebSocket notifications indicating rollback status.

## Query, Validation & Persistence
- **Ontology Querying:** Rapid search and validation of ontology concepts via CLI and HTTP/GraphQL interfaces.
- **Data Persistence:** Methods to export ontologies in OWL XML format, as well as clear, merge, and update operations that maintain consistent data structures during live updates.

## Web Server and CLI Integration
- **Unified Interface:** Although the CORE_ENGINE handles backend processes, it integrates with the unified CLI and HTTP/GraphQL interfaces. This ensures that diagnostic logs, telemetry data, and live updates are readily available through a consistent user interface.
- **Real-Time Notifications:** On key events—such as live data refresh, merge, or rollback—WebSocket notifications are broadcast with details including the updated ontology title, version, and status messages.

## Benefits
- **Reliability & Maintainability:** Enhanced environment variable parsing reduces runtime configuration issues and improves system resilience.
- **Actionable Diagnostics:** Comprehensive and aggregated telemetry ensures that developers gain immediate insight into system health and configuration anomalies.
- **Optimized Performance:** With robust caching and automated recovery mechanisms, the CORE_ENGINE ensures that owl-builder delivers up-to-date ontologies without sacrificing reliability.
features/rejects/CONFIG_MANAGER.md
# features/rejects/CONFIG_MANAGER.md
# CONFIG_MANAGER

## Overview
This feature provides a centralized module for managing environment configuration and integrated diagnostic telemetry. It not only standardizes the parsing, normalization, and CLI override precedence for environment variables but also aggregates diagnostic data from invalid or malformed inputs. By consolidating telemetry data—previously scattered across components—into a single, cohesive module, the feature improves maintainability and observability across the repository.

## Features
- **Centralized Parsing & Overrides:** Implements robust normalization (trimming and collapsing of whitespace, including non-breaking spaces) and numeric parsing for environment variables. CLI-provided values always take precedence over environment and fallback values.
- **Integrated Telemetry Aggregation:** Utilizes a promise-based batching mechanism to log a single diagnostic warning per unique invalid input. Each event includes details such as the raw input value, CLI override status, and a timestamp. The aggregated telemetry summary is accessible using the CLI flag `--diagnostic-summary-naN` and can be leveraged for further integration with external monitoring systems.
- **Consistency and Observability:** Provides a unified API (including functions like `normalizeEnvValue`, `parseEnvNumber`, `resetEnvWarningCache`, and `getAggregatedNaNSummary`) to retrieve both configuration values and diagnostic telemetry data, thereby ensuring consistent behavior and rapid troubleshooting.

## Implementation Details
- **Enhanced Utility Functions:** Update and integrate existing helper functions to ensure that any non-numeric or malformed input triggers a single, batched telemetry event.
- **Asynchronous Batching:** Leverages promise-based batching for telemetry flushes under high concurrency to guarantee atomic aggregation of diagnostic warnings.
- **Migration of Telemetry:** Diagnostic telemetry originally embedded in other features (such as the telemetry HTTP endpoint in Ontology Service) is now consolidated in CONFIG_MANAGER. This not only avoids duplication but establishes a single source of truth for configuration-related diagnostics.

## Benefits
- **Improved Maintainability:** By centralizing configuration and telemetry, the codebase becomes easier to maintain and extend.
- **Proactive Diagnostics:** Immediate access to aggregated telemetry helps in quickly identifying and resolving configuration issues.
- **Streamlined Integration:** Other components (like Ontology Service and the Web Dashboard) can rely on a consistent and centralized telemetry API for enhanced observability.
features/rejects/ENDPOINT_HEALTH.md
# features/rejects/ENDPOINT_HEALTH.md
# Endpoint Health

This feature provides real-time monitoring of all configured API endpoints used by the ontology builder. By periodically checking the health of endpoints, it ensures that any connectivity issues or failures are detected early and reported through both diagnostic logs and CLI outputs.

## Overview

The Endpoint Health feature will:

- Continuously ping both default and custom endpoints (as configured via the `CUSTOM_API_ENDPOINTS` environment variable).
- Log the status of each endpoint with detailed error messages when an endpoint is unresponsive or returns an error.
- Expose a new CLI command (`--health`) that displays a summary of the health status of each endpoint. This summary will include metrics such as response time, status code, and error details if applicable.
- Integrate with the existing diagnostic logging system to ensure consistency with log levels (configured via `DIAGNOSTIC_LOG_LEVEL`).

## Implementation Details

- **Endpoint Checker Module:** A new module will be created (e.g., `src/lib/endpointHealth.js`) that handles the periodic checking of endpoints using the existing HTTP/HTTPS request methods. It will support configuration of check intervals via an environment variable (e.g., `HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL`).
- **CLI Integration:** Add a new CLI command `--health` that will trigger the endpoint health check and print a well-formatted status summary.
- **Logging and Alerts:** Utilize the `logDiagnostic` function to log warnings/errors for endpoints that fail health checks. Optionally, integrate an alert mechanism (e.g., a simple console alert or file-based alert) for critical issues.
- **Configuration Options:** Allow configuration of health check interval and timeout via environment variables. Also, the feature should gracefully disable itself if a certain environment variable (e.g., `DISABLE_HEALTH_CHECK`) is set.

## Testing

- **Unit Tests:** Create tests to simulate various endpoint responses (successful, timeout, error) and ensure that the health checker logs appropriate messages and returns correct status summaries.
- **Integration Tests:** Ensure that the new CLI command `--health` outputs valid JSON or formatted text summarizing the endpoint statuses. Use mock endpoints to simulate live conditions.
- **Edge Cases:** Verify behavior when no custom endpoints are provided and when endpoints are temporarily down.

This feature aligns with the mission of providing live, verified data sources by ensuring proactive monitoring and reliability of endpoint connections.

# features/rejects/ENV_CONFIG.md
# ENV_CONFIG

This feature introduces a robust, unified configuration module to handle live data integration environment variables. It ensures that numeric environment variables are parsed in a consistent manner, applying fallback values when needed, and logging detailed diagnostic messages only once per unique invalid input. This unifies the handling of inputs such as "NaN" across various whitespace and case variations, and it integrates CLI override values that take precedence over default and fallback settings.

## Overview

- **Unified Parsing:** Consolidates the live data related environment variable parsing logic (for example, for `LIVEDATA_RETRY_COUNT` and `LIVEDATA_INITIAL_DELAY`) into a dedicated module.

- **CLI Overrides & Strict Mode:** Supports CLI options (`--livedata-retry-default` and `--livedata-delay-default`) to override environment values on the fly, and enforces strict mode when specified so that only valid numeric inputs are accepted.
- **Fallback Behavior:** Gracefully handles cases where environment values are undefined, empty, or non-string types without flooding logs with repeated warnings.

## Implementation Details

- **Module Extraction:** Extract the parsing utility (currently encapsulated in _parseEnvNumber and related logic) into a dedicated module (e.g., `src/lib/envConfig.js`).
- **One-Time Warning Cache:** Refine and centralize the caching mechanism to suppress duplicate warnings based on the composite key of variable name and normalized input.
- **CLI Integration:** Update the main CLI dispatcher to leverage the new configuration module for reading live data settings, ensuring that CLI supplied override values are prioritized.
- **Strict Mode Support:** Introduce additional checks such that when strict mode is enabled (via `--strict-env` or `STRICT_ENV=true`), any non-numeric value throws an explanatory error.

## Testing

- **Unit Tests:** Add tests to simulate various invalid inputs (e.g., empty strings, several variants of "NaN" with extra spaces, tabs, and non-breaking spaces) ensuring that only one warning is logged per unique normalized input.
- **Integration Tests:** Ensure behavior remains consistent when environment variables are missing, non-numeric, or overridden via CLI, both in non-strict and strict modes.
- **Fallback Verification:** Validate that the fallback values are correctly applied in case of invalid inputs and that the diagnostic logs include detailed unit information (variable name, raw input, normalized input, and fallback value with unit).

- **Remote Operations:** Provide lightweight HTTP endpoints for triggering diagnostics, retrieving unified reports, and managing operational commands remotely.

## Implementation & Testing
- **Modularization:** Enhance the existing single-file based implementation (e.g., `src/lib/operations.js`) to incorporate the enhanced CLI toolkit functionality. Refactor `src/lib/main.js` where necessary to delegate robust CLI parsing and dynamic help generation to the extended OPERATIONS module.
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Develop unit and integration tests covering all enhancements, including new argument parsing logic, dynamic help message output, and interactive CLI behaviors.
- **Documentation Updates:** Update repository documentation, README, and CONTRIBUTING guidelines to include usage examples and configuration details for the enhanced CLI toolkit and its integration within the OPERATIONS functionalities.

## Value Proposition
By merging traditional operations management with an enhanced, user-friendly CLI toolkit, this update simplifies interaction with the tool. Developers benefit from improved error handling, dynamic help content, and guided interactive prompts, leading to faster troubleshooting and a smoother Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) workflow. This enhancement aligns with our mission to simplify API change management and foster effective developer collaboration.features/SCHEMA_MANAGER.md

# SCHEMA_MANAGER Feature Enhancement

## Overview
The SCHEMA_MANAGER remains the core module for managing and evolving JSON Schemas. It is responsible for schema diff generation, version control, auto‐fixing, linting, risk analysis, and real‐time monitoring. In this enhancement, we refine the remote synchronization capabilities to improve multi-source collaboration and conflict resolution.

## Remote Synchronization Enhancement
- **Enhanced Remote Sync:** Improve the existing remote synchronization mechanism to better handle updates from multiple sources. The system will now support bi-directional sync, ensuring that local and remote schema changes are merged intelligently.
- **Conflict Detection and Resolution:** Integrate advanced conflict detection that not only identifies merge conflicts but offers actionable guidance. Provide an interactive prompt (via CLI flags) that assists users in resolving discrepancies with clear, annotated diff reports.
- **Extended Audit Trail:** Record both local and remote changes in an expanded audit log. This log will capture synchronization events, conflicts, and resolutions, providing a full traceable history of modifications.

## Collaboration and Integration
- **Collaborative Messaging Hooks:** Integrate optional messaging hooks (invokable via secure CLI flags) that can alert team members of critical schema changes or synchronization conflicts. These hooks use configurable channels while avoiding explicit notification naming to adhere to project guidelines.
- **Multi-Format Reporting:** Generate comprehensive diff and synchronization reports in Markdown, HTML, PDF, and YAML formats. These reports will include visual diff views and interactive elements to aid in manual conflict resolution if necessary.

## Implementation & Testing
- **Source Code Extension:** Enhance the main schema manager source file (`src/lib/schema_manager.js`) with the refined synchronization and conflict resolution features.
- **CLI and HTTP Integration:** Update the command parser to support additional CLI flags (e.g., `--sync`, `--resolve-conflict`) and provide lightweight HTTP endpoints for remote operations.
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Expand unit and integration tests to cover multi-source synchronization scenarios, conflict detection accuracy, audit log completeness, and the correct functioning of interactive resolution prompts.
- **Documentation Updates:** Update repository documentation, including the README and CONTRIBUTING guidelines, to reflect the new synchronization and conflict management features with examples and usage instructions.

## Value Proposition
This enhancement accelerates team collaboration by ensuring that local and remote JSON Schema changes are kept in perfect sync. It minimizes manual conflict resolution efforts by providing clear, actionable insights and interactive assistance. This update aligns perfectly with our mission to simplify API change management and deliver a robust, user-friendly tool for schema evolution.
