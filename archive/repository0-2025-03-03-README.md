# `repository0-crucible`

The repository is intended as a template that includes:
* A Template Base: A starting point for new projects.
* A Running Experiment: An example implementation that demonstrates one way to use the template.
* Workflows from `agentic‑lib` which reference reusable workflows.

## Overview
`repository0-crucible` is a demo repository that showcases the GitHub workflows imported from intentïon `agentic‑lib`. Its primary purpose is to demonstrate these automated CI/CD workflows.

## What’s Inside

- **GitHub Workflows:**  
  Workflows in the `.github/workflows/` directory consume reusable workflows from intentïon `agentic‑lib` for tasks such as testing, linting, formatting, and deployment.

- **Source Code:**  
  The main functionality is in `src/lib/main.js`. This file is the focus of the workflow and is modified by the workflow to deliver the project goals.

- **Dependencies:**  
  The `package.json` file lists all necessary dependencies and defines scripts for testing, building, formatting, and updating.

- **Tests:**  
  Unit tests in the `tests/unit/` folder ensure that the main script behaves as expected. The test suite has been expanded to achieve near 100% coverage, verifying all command line flags and edge cases.

- **Docs:**
  This `README.md` provides current usage information and outlines how to contribute, as described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Getting Started

This repository is pre-configured with workflows and scripts. Before running, ensure you set the following secret:
- `CHATGPT_API_SECRET_KEY` – Required for access to the OpenAI API (model `o3-mini`). Configure it in *Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions*.

## intentïon `agentic‑lib`

The **intentïon `agentic‑lib`** is a collection of reusable GitHub Actions workflows that enable your repository to operate autonomously. These workflows continuously test, build, update, and evolve your code through automated processes.

*Warning:* Running these workflows might incur charges on your OpenAI account and consume GitHub Actions minutes.

*Warning:* Experimental. This system is under active development and may evolve over time.

## Test Coverage
The provided test suite covers nearly 100% of the code paths, including edge conditions and error handling cases. This ensures robust CLI behavior and high confidence in the functionality of the arithmetic operations.
