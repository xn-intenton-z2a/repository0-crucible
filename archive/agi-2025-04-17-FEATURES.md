# REPLICATION

## Overview
Replication endows the agent with the ability to multiply its efforts, either by parallelizing tasks or by propagating itself to new contexts. In practice, this trait means the agent can spawn concurrent processes or handle multiple commands at once, rather than strictly one at a time in sequence. This is important for an AGI-aligned system aiming to work at scale or across projects: as tasks grow or number of repositories increases, a single-threaded agent would become a bottleneck. With replication, the agent can tackle different subtasks simultaneously (like an organism growing new cells to handle more function), and even create copies of its logic to deploy into other repositories or environments. Initially, we focus on parallel execution of command batches as a form of “soft” replication. This will improve throughput and test the waters for true multi-agent operation.

## Implementation Details
1. **Parallel Batch Execution:** Modify the batch processing behavior in `agenticHandler` to support parallel command execution when requested. Introduce a flag in the payload, for example `payload.parallel === true`, to indicate that if a list of `commands` is provided, they can be processed concurrently. By default, the existing behavior is sequential to preserve order, so this flag must be explicitly set by the user or calling context.
2. **Implement Concurrency with Promises:** In the `'commands' in payload` branch of `agenticHandler`, add a condition for parallel execution. If `payload.parallel` is true:
    - Instead of using a `for...of` loop to iterate through commands one by one, use `Promise.all` to initiate all command operations at once. For each command string in the array, call a helper function or the core processing logic to produce a result promise. (This core logic can be the same code that the sequential loop uses – consider refactoring the single-command processing into a small function that can be called for each element).
    - Await the `Promise.all` to get an array of results. Ensure that `globalThis.callCount` is incremented appropriately for each command (if the helper function increments it, this will naturally happen; otherwise, you may need to increment in a thread-safe manner, but since JavaScript is single-threaded per event loop, increments in each promise callback are fine).
    - Return the aggregated result object with all individual results, same as in sequential mode. The order of results in the array should correspond to the order of input commands. (Note: `Promise.all` will preserve order of the results matching the input array indices, even though execution is concurrent, so the user sees a predictable order in the output.)
3. **Ensure Backward Compatibility:** If `payload.parallel` is not set or false, retain the current sequential processing. This is important because some tasks might depend on order or have side effects that can’t safely run in parallel. By requiring an explicit flag, we ensure existing usage remains deterministic.
4. **Testing Parallel Behavior:** Write tests to validate the replication/parallel feature:
    - For a given payload with multiple commands and `parallel: true`, ensure that the `agenticHandler` returns the correct number of results and that each result is a success for the respective command. Verify that `globalThis.callCount` increased by the number of commands. (It’s hard to unit test actual concurrency timing without introducing artificial delays, but we can at least ensure it doesn’t crash and produces the same outcome as sequential in terms of data).
    - As a basic concurrency test, you might simulate a scenario where one command would take longer than another by using a mock or spy. For example, spy on `logInfo` and insert a small delay in one of the command processes. Then call the parallel handler and confirm that all results come back. This is more of an integration test; as a unit test, we can assume Node’s promise handling works and just focus on outcome correctness.
    - Also test that without the flag, the behavior remains sequential (for completeness, though the existing tests already cover sequential batch).
5. **Document Usage:** In the README, add a note about **Parallel Command Execution:** Explain that the agent supports running batch commands in parallel to increase speed. Show an example JSON payload: `{"commands": ["task1", "task2", "task3"], "parallel": true}`. Caution the user that tasks should be independent when using this mode, since parallel execution means they won’t wait for each other’s completion. Mention that this parallelism is an initial form of agent “replication” – the agent effectively creates concurrent workers for each task internally.

## Long-Term Direction
Replication as parallel execution is just the first step. In the future, this capability could evolve into the agent spawning fully independent sub-agents or threads that not only run concurrently but possibly on different machines or for different repositories. For instance, the agent could duplicate its core logic and deploy it to another repository to assist with that project (a form of self-propagation across repositories). It might also manage a pool of worker agents, assigning tasks to each (achieving load balancing and higher availability). With cloud infrastructure (like AWS Lambda, which this project already targets), one can imagine the agent spinning up multiple Lambda instances to handle a flood of tasks simultaneously – the foundation laid by the parallel flag would scale up to that scenario. In the long term, robust replication means the system can handle large-scale automation: dozens of tasks across multiple projects might be handled at once by a swarm of agent instances that share a common memory or mission. We will need to also introduce coordination mechanisms (to avoid duplicated effort or conflicting actions), which combined with replication leads to the concept of a **multi-agent orchestra** working in harmony on overarching goals.

- **Automated Issue Generation:** Submit descriptive prompts to the Chat Completions API to generate a series of actionable GitHub issues.
- **Template Customization:** Allow users to define custom prompt templates and parameters to influence the issue generation style and content.
- **CLI Integration:** Expose a new CLI command (e.g., `--gen-issues`) to trigger the issue generation process, with options for specifying prompt details or template names.
- **Traceability:** Include diagnostic logging to capture the details of API interactions and the resulting generated issues.
- **Configuration:** Support environment variable overrides and CLI flags to control aspects such as API key, prompt template selection, and output formatting.

## Implementation Details

- **API Integration Module:** Create a new module (e.g., `src/lib/issueGenerator.js`) that encapsulates the logic for calling the Chat Completions API (using the OpenAI dependency) with a provided prompt.
- **CLI Command:** Add a new CLI flag (e.g., `--gen-issues`) within the main CLI dispatcher to allow users to trigger the issue generation process. The command will accept parameters for custom prompt or template names.
- **Prompt Template Management:** Provide a default prompt template that describes the repository context, current feature set, and implementation guidelines. Allow users to override this template via environment variable (e.g., `ISSUE_TEMPLATE`) or CLI options.
- **Logging and Diagnostics:** Integrate with the existing diagnostic logging mechanism to report API call status, any errors returned from the Chat Completions API, and a summary of the generated issues.
- **Output Format:** Return the generated issues in a structured JSON format that can either be directly submitted to GitHub or further processed to create issues via the GitHub API.

## Testing

- **Unit Tests:** Create tests to simulate various responses from the Chat Completions API, verifying that the module returns correctly structured issue objects given a descriptive prompt.
- **Integration Tests:** Ensure that when the `--gen-issues` CLI command is invoked, the output is a list of issue descriptions that match repository style guidelines, and that the diagnostic logs contain appropriate details.
- **Edge Cases:** Test behavior when the API returns errors, when invalid prompt parameters are supplied, and when custom templates are used.

This feature extends the automation capabilities of the repository, enabling efficient issue creation for iterative development while ensuring adherence to the repository guidelines and mission objectives.features/rejects/ARG_PARSER.md
# features/rejects/ARG_PARSER.md
# ARG_PARSER Feature Specification

This feature enhances the CLI behavior by implementing a simple argument parser in the main source file. The parser will inspect the command line arguments and execute the corresponding action, promoting a cleaner and more informative user experience.

## Overview

The argument parser will analyze the process argument list and respond to flags including, but not limited to, "--help", "--diagnostics", "--serve", "--build-intermediate", "--build-enhanced", "--refresh", and "--merge-persist". It will provide appropriate messages or execute a stub of functionality for each recognized flag.

## Implementation Details

- Update the source file (src/lib/main.js) to include a dedicated argument parsing section.
- Use a switch-case structure, or if/else logic, to differentiate between the various commands.
- For unrecognized arguments, the CLI will default to a standard usage message, guiding the user to the help documentation.
- Enhance the README (README.md) to include examples on how to use the new argument flags.
- Update the unit tests (tests/unit/main.test.js) to confirm that the parser handles known commands without errors.
- The changes will be confined to the CLI tool functionality and will not affect external interfaces or create new files.

## Benefits

- **Improved Usability:** Users receive clear feedback when using CLI commands.
- **Scalability:** Provides a foundation for future extension of CLI commands without major restructuring.
- **Alignment with Mission:** Enhances our intelligent and practical automation agent by making command handling more robust and user-friendly.

- The code comments in the main source file will reflect the purpose and functionality of each command processed by the parser.
features/rejects/CLI_DIAGNOSTICS.md
# features/rejects/CLI_DIAGNOSTICS.md
# CLI_DIAGNOSTICS Feature Specification

## Overview
This feature introduces a diagnostics functionality to the CLI tool. When the `--diagnostics` flag is provided, the application will output relevant system and environment information, including Node.js version, environment variables, and other configuration details that aid in troubleshooting.

## Implementation Details
- **Source File Update (src/lib/main.js):**
  - Extend the argument parser to detect the `--diagnostics` flag.
  - When the flag is present, execute a diagnostics routine that collects system information such as the Node.js version, current environment variables, and other runtime details.

features/rejects/ENDPOINT_HEALTH.md
# features/rejects/ENDPOINT_HEALTH.md
# Endpoint Health

This feature provides real-time monitoring of all configured API endpoints used by the ontology builder. By periodically checking the health of endpoints, it ensures that any connectivity issues or failures are detected early and reported through both diagnostic logs and CLI outputs.

## Overview

The Endpoint Health feature will:

- Continuously ping both default and custom endpoints (as configured via the `CUSTOM_API_ENDPOINTS` environment variable).
- Log the status of each endpoint with detailed error messages when an endpoint is unresponsive or returns an error.
- Expose a new CLI command (`--health`) that displays a summary of the health status of each endpoint. This summary will include metrics such as response time, status code, and error details if applicable.
- Integrate with the existing diagnostic logging system to ensure consistency with log levels (configured via `DIAGNOSTIC_LOG_LEVEL`).

## Implementation Details

- **Endpoint Checker Module:** A new module will be created (e.g., `src/lib/endpointHealth.js`) that handles the periodic checking of endpoints using the existing HTTP/HTTPS request methods. It will support configuration of check intervals via an environment variable (e.g., `HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL`).
- **CLI Integration:** Add a new CLI command `--health` that will trigger the endpoint health check and print a well-formatted status summary.
- **Logging and Alerts:** Utilize the `logDiagnostic` function to log warnings/errors for endpoints that fail health checks. Optionally, integrate an alert mechanism (e.g., a simple console alert or file-based alert) for critical issues.
- **Configuration Options:** Allow configuration of health check interval and timeout via environment variables. Also, the feature should gracefully disable itself if a certain environment variable (e.g., `DISABLE_HEALTH_CHECK`) is set.

## Testing

- **Unit Tests:** Create tests to simulate various endpoint responses (successful, timeout, error) and ensure that the health checker logs appropriate messages and returns correct status summaries.
- **Integration Tests:** Ensure that the new CLI command `--health` outputs valid JSON or formatted text summarizing the endpoint statuses. Use mock endpoints to simulate live conditions.
- **Edge Cases:** Verify behavior when no custom endpoints are provided and when endpoints are temporarily down.

This feature aligns with the mission of providing live, verified data sources by ensuring proactive monitoring and reliability of endpoint connections.
features/rejects/CLI_HELP.md
# features/rejects/CLI_HELP.md
# CLI_HELP Feature Specification

## Overview
This feature enhances the CLI tool by adding a comprehensive help command. When the '--help' flag is present in the command line arguments, the tool will output a detailed usage guide that includes available commands and usage examples. This guide will be dynamically maintained and documented in the README file.

- Ensure comprehensive documentation and testing for the new help functionality.
features/PLAN_DECOMPOSITION.md
# features/PLAN_DECOMPOSITION.md
# PLAN_DECOMPOSITION

## Overview
This feature refines the goal planning and decomposition capability of the CLI tool. It continues to allow users to provide a high-level goal that is split into sub-tasks, but now includes enhanced parsing techniques, improved error tolerance, and tighter integration with memory logging. The feature remains closely aligned with the mission of autonomous intelligent automation by making goal execution more transparent and reliable.

## Implementation Details
1. **Enhanced Goal Parsing:**
   - Extend the parsing logic in `src/lib/main.js` to handle a wider range of delimiters (such as commas, semicolons, "then", and newline characters) to better split multi-part goals.
   - Improve heuristics to detect poorly structured or ambiguous commands, and provide graceful fallback messages for malformed goals.

2. **Dual Modes of Operation:**
   - **Decomposition Mode:** If the input payload includes a flag (e.g. `decomposeOnly`), output the list of sub-tasks in JSON without executing them.
   - **Execution Mode:** In the absence of the `decomposeOnly` flag, sequentially execute each parsed sub-task while updating the global call count and appending the processed information to the in-memory log.

3. **Integration with Memory:**
   - Ensure that each decomposed sub-task and its result (or error) are logged into the global memoryLog, enhancing traceability and accountability for each planning action.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Refine error messages for cases when a goal cannot be correctly parsed. Provide actionable feedback such as suggesting use of clearer delimiters or checking the goal format.

## Testing
1. **Unit Tests:**
   - Update tests in `tests/unit/main.test.js` to include payloads with various delimiter types. Verify that even partial goal definitions provide a useful list of sub-tasks.
   - Test scenarios where the input goal is ambiguous or malformed to confirm that the tool returns a descriptive error without crashing.

2. **Integration Verification:**
   - Simulate both decomposeOnly mode and execution mode to check that sub-tasks are appropriately processed and logged in memory.

## Documentation
1. **README Update:**
   - Enhance the CLI Options section to document the improved planning and decomposition functionality. For example:
     ```bash
     node src/lib/main.js --agentic '{ "goal": "Initialize project. Then, setup configuration; finally, run tests.", "decomposeOnly": true }'
     ```
   - Clearly differentiate between preview (decomposition mode) and full execution mode.

## Long-Term Direction
This enhancement forms a bridge to future improvements such as dynamic re-planning based on sub-task outcomes and more advanced natural language processing. The updated PLAN_DECOMPOSITION feature sets a robust foundation that ensures clearer goal articulation and enhanced operational logging, fully supporting the mission's vision of intelligent, autonomous task management.features/MEMORY_PERFORMANCE.md
# features/MEMORY_PERFORMANCE.md
# MEMORY_PERFORMANCE

## Overview
This feature enhances the CLI tool's memory logging mechanism by not only tracking the execution duration for each command but also by aggregating and reporting usage statistics. In addition to recording a timestamp and duration for every CLI invocation, the tool now supports a new flag `--usage-stats` to summarize historical usage data, such as total invocation count, average execution duration, minimum and maximum durations, and other relevant statistics. This enhancement aids in performance monitoring and future optimization efforts.

## Implementation Details
1. **Timing Measurement:**
   - At the very beginning of the `main` function in `src/lib/main.js`, record the start time (e.g. `const startTime = Date.now();`).
   - Right before each return point (or after processing the main command logic), compute the elapsed time (`Date.now() - startTime`).
   - Append this `duration` (in milliseconds) to the latest log entry in the global `memoryLog`.

2. **Usage Statistics Aggregation:**
   - Introduce a new CLI flag `--usage-stats` in the command handler dispatch table.
   - When the CLI is invoked with `--usage-stats`, calculate summary statistics from the `memoryLog`:
     - **Total Invocations:** Count of log entries.
     - **Average Duration:** Mean duration of all invocations.
     - **Minimum Duration:** Shortest execution time recorded.
     - **Maximum Duration:** Longest execution time recorded.
   - Output these statistics in a structured JSON format and exit the process.

3. **Source File Modifications (`src/lib/main.js`):**
   - Insert timing code at the start of the `main` function as before and update each log entry to include `duration`.
   - Add a condition to check for the `--usage-stats` flag. If detected, aggregate the statistics from `memoryLog` and output them via `console.log(JSON.stringify(stats, null, 2))`, then terminate without further processing.

4. **Testing Updates (`tests/unit/main.test.js`):**
   - Add new tests to simulate CLI calls with the `--usage-stats` flag.
   - Verify that the output contains the correct summary statistics (e.g., total count, average, min, and max durations) and that durations are non-negative numbers.
   - Update existing memory logging tests to confirm that each log entry includes a valid `duration` property.

5. **Documentation Updates (README.md):**
   - In the CLI Options section, document the new `--usage-stats` flag. Provide an example invocation:
     ```bash
     node src/lib/main.js --usage-stats
     ```
   - Explain that this flag outputs a summary of CLI invocation statistics, which can be used for performance monitoring and optimization insights.

## Long-Term Direction
By adding usage statistics aggregation, the tool not only records granular execution details but also provides higher-level insights into its performance over time. This lays the groundwork for future features such as automated performance tuning, anomaly detection in execution times, and dynamic adjustments based on usage patterns. The enhanced memory performance tracking aligns with the mission of transparent and autonomous intelligent automation by turning raw log data into actionable insights.features/CONFIGURATION.md
# features/CONFIGURATION.md
# CONFIGURATION

## Overview
This feature leverages the existing dependency on dotenv to add configuration management capabilities to the CLI tool. It now not only loads environment variables from a .env file but also validates the presence of required environment variables. This enhancement improves runtime flexibility, offers early detection of misconfigurations, and aligns with best practices for managing configurable parameters in production. Additionally, users can verify the loaded configuration via a dedicated CLI flag.

## Implementation Details
1. **Environment Loading & Validation:**
   - At the very beginning of `src/lib/main.js`, import and invoke `dotenv.config()` so that environment variables are loaded from a `.env` file if present.
   - Immediately after loading the configuration, validate specific required environment variables (for example, `APP_ENV` and `API_KEY`). For each required variable, check if it exists and if not, output a warning message to the console, e.g.:
     ```js
     const requiredEnv = ['APP_ENV', 'API_KEY'];
     requiredEnv.forEach(key => {
       if (!process.env[key]) {
         console.warn(`Warning: Required environment variable ${key} is not set.`);
       }
     });
     ```
   - This ensures users are aware of missing essential settings before the CLI processes further commands.

2. **New CLI Flag: `--config`**
   - Introduce a new command-line flag `--config` to display the currently loaded configuration.
   - When the CLI is invoked with the `--config` flag, the tool should output a JSON representation of relevant environment variables and then exit.
   - This serves both as a debugging tool and as a verification step for configuration correctness.

3. **Source File Modifications (`src/lib/main.js`):**
   - Import and invoke `dotenv.config();` at the top of the main function.
   - Add the environment variable validation logic immediately after configuration is loaded.
   - Implement logic that checks for `--config` in the arguments, outputs the JSON formatted configuration using `JSON.stringify(process.env, null, 2)`, and then exits.

4. **Testing (`tests/unit/main.test.js`):**
   - Update tests to simulate CLI calls with the `--config` flag.
   - Write new tests to ensure that if required environment variables are missing (or set to empty), a warning message is output to the console.
   - Ensure that when the environment is properly configured, no warning is produced and the expected configuration is displayed.

5. **Documentation Updates (README.md):**
   - Update the **CLI Options** section to include the configuration flag:
     ```bash
     node src/lib/main.js --config
     ```
   - Add documentation explaining that missing required environment variables (e.g., `APP_ENV` and `API_KEY`) will result in warning messages, and provide guidance on how to set these variables in a `.env` file.

## Long-Term Direction
This configuration feature now provides both environment loading and validation, laying the foundation for more robust runtime customization. Future iterations could support dynamic configuration reloading, more granular filtering of environment variables, and integration with remote configuration services. For now, this enhancement provides a clear mechanism to ensure the system is properly configured before processing further commands.features/USER_ASSISTANCE.md
# features/USER_ASSISTANCE.md
# USER_ASSISTANCE

## Overview
This feature merges and refines the capabilities of intelligent command suggestion and enhanced verbose logging. It combines the error correction from the SUGGESTIONS feature and the visual, color-coded output enhancements from the SELF_ASSISTANCE feature. The unified USER_ASSISTANCE feature delivers improved guidance for users, offering suggestions for mistyped commands as well as clear, context-aware feedback during self-refinement and help-seeking routines.

## Implementation Details
1. **Enhanced Error Handling and Suggestions:**
   - Integrate logic to detect near-miss command inputs using simple string comparison or Levenshtein distance.
   - If a user inputs an unrecognized command that closely matches a valid flag, append a suggestion (e.g. "Did you mean '--help'?") to the error message.
   - Ensure that suggestions trigger only when the similarity score meets a reasonable threshold.

2. **Verbose Logging with Color-Coded Output:**
   - Import the `chalk` library in `src/lib/main.js` and check for a `--verbose` flag at runtime.
   - When activated, log key messages from self-refinement and help-seeking routines with color-coded formatting (for example, green for standard messages and red for errors).
   - Modify functions such as `selfRefine()` and `helpSeeking()` to conditionally apply chalk formatting when `globalThis.verboseMode` is active.

3. **Centralized User Assistance Routine:**
   - Combine the adjustments from both previous features into a single user assistance handling block to avoid redundancy.
   - Ensure that the feature remains non-intrusive when either the error suggestion or verbose modes are not in use.
   - Maintain backward compatibility with existing CLI operations and error handling mechanisms.

## Testing
1. **Unit Tests:**
   - Update tests in `tests/unit/main.test.js` to simulate inputs with slight typos (e.g. "--hlp" instead of "--help") and verify that the suggestion message appears.
   - Test CLI invocations with the `--verbose` flag to ensure that log messages include the correct ANSI color codes.
   - Confirm that both functionalities can operate concurrently without interfering with one another.

2. **Regression Tests:**
   - Ensure that the updated error messages maintain the base structure and merely append useful suggestions where applicable.
   - Verify that the verbose output only activates when explicitly requested.

## Documentation
1. **README Updates:**
   - Update the CLI Options section to note that unrecognized commands now trigger suggestions to correct minor typos.
   - Provide usage examples demonstrating both normal and `--verbose` modes:
     ```bash
     node src/lib/main.js --hlp
     # Output: Error: '--hlp' is not recognized. Did you mean '--help'?

     node src/lib/main.js --verbose --self-refine
     # Output: [Color-coded message] Performing self-refinement analysis...
     ```

2. **User Guidance:**
   - Clearly document in the help system that the USER_ASSISTANCE feature provides additional output clarity and guidance.

## Long-Term Direction
This consolidated feature lays the groundwork for future enhancements such as dynamic natural language processing for context-aware corrections and a more adaptive, self-improving user assistance system. As the project evolves, USER_ASSISTANCE may incorporate more sophisticated models to predict user intent and offer even more targeted feedback.
features/CLI_SPINNER.md
# features/CLI_SPINNER.md
# CLI_SPINNER

## Overview
This feature introduces an interactive spinner to improve user experience for long-running CLI tasks in the repository. By integrating a spinner using the `ora` library, users receive visual feedback during operations that take longer to complete, such as parallel command execution or extended diagnostics. This enhancement aligns with the mission of transparent automation and intelligent feedback.

## Implementation Details
1. **Spinner Integration in Main CLI**
   - Import the `ora` library at the top of `src/lib/main.js`.
   - Introduce a new CLI flag `--spinner` which, when included, activates the spinner during any non-trivial command execution.
   - For commands that may have a higher processing time (e.g. `--replication` tasks or diagnostics), wrap the core logic with spinner start and stop calls:
     ```js
     import ora from 'ora';
     // ... inside main function, before processing a long task:
     const spinner = ora('Processing...').start();
     // Execute the core logic
     // ... after processing, stop spinner
     spinner.succeed('Done');
     ```

2. **Non-Intrusive Behavior**
   - Ensure that the spinner does not interfere when the CLI tool is used without `--spinner`. The spinner should only activate when explicitly requested or when a command takes longer than a specified threshold.
   
3. **Testing Adjustments**
   - Update tests in `tests/unit/main.test.js` to simulate CLI calls with the `--spinner` flag. Use mocks or spies to assert that spinner methods (`start`, `succeed`, etc.) are called.
   - Ensure test outputs strip spinner-related log artifacts to verify correctness of the core CLI functionality.

4. **Documentation Updates (README.md)**
   - Add a new section to document the `--spinner` flag. Explain that when activated, a spinner will provide visual progress feedback during longer operations.
   - Provide examples, such as:
     ```bash
     node src/lib/main.js --spinner --diagnostics
     ```

5. **Dependency Updates**
   - Add `ora` as a dependency to `package.json` (e.g. "ora": "^6.1.0").
   - Ensure the dependency installation and version meet our Node 20 and ESM standards.

## Long-Term Direction
The introduction of an interactive spinner paves the way for additional user interface enhancements in the CLI, such as progress bars for batch operations, dynamic logging feedback, and more granular status updates. This feature supports the mission of autonomous automation by making long-running tasks more transparent and user-friendly.
