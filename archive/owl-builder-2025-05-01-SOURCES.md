# W3C RDF 1.1, OWL 2 Profiles & Semantics
## https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/
This consolidated source provides the high-level overview of the OWL 2 Web Ontology Language, linked to all foundational W3C Recommendations: RDF 1.1 Concepts & Abstract Syntax, OWL 2 Ontology Profiles, OWL 2 Direct Semantics, and OWL 2 Mapping to RDF Graphs. It underpins context management, framing, reasoning, consistency checking, normalization, and serialization in the ontology build pipeline by defining graph modeling semantics, profile conformance, formal semantics, and RDF mapping. Last updated December 2012 for OWL 2; RDF 1.1 parts last updated June 2014. Authoritative W3C Recommendation.

# W3C JSON-LD 1.1 Core, API & Processing Algorithms
## https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/
This source provides the W3C Recommendation for JSON-LD 1.1 Core Processing Algorithms, Data Model, Syntax, and the JSON-LD API for programmatic manipulation (compact, expand, flatten, frame). It defines context handling, framing semantics, and RDF conversion critical for JSON-LD operations in this repository. Last updated June 2020 (Core) and January 2022 (API). Authoritative W3C Recommendation.

# SPARQL Query Engines & Endpoints
## https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-overview/
This unified source consolidates W3C SPARQL 1.1 Query, Update, and HTTP Graph Store Protocol specifications with standard RDF serializations (Turtle, N-Quads). It includes guidance for implementing HTTP-based SPARQL endpoints, federation, transaction management, and optimization strategies. The content also references modular JavaScript engines such as Comunica for streaming query execution, source configuration, and client integration. Last updated March 2013 (SPARQL 1.1); Comunica docs updated April 2024. Authoritative W3C Recommendation with community implementations.

# RDF Graph Shape Validation Standards: SHACL & ShEx
## https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/
This source covers the W3C SHACL Recommendation for RDF graph validation—defining core shapes, property constraints, targets, and SPARQL-based extensions—and the community-driven Shape Expressions (ShEx) grammar for high-performance shape definitions and streaming validation. Essential for enforcing graph integrity and declarative validation in ontology pipelines. Last updated July 2023 (SHACL) and February 2023 (ShEx).
