# features/TIMESTAMP_OUTPUT.md
# TIMESTAMP_OUTPUT

## Overview
This feature adds a timestamp to the log outputs when the CLI is executed with the `--timestamp` flag. When enabled, each console log message in the CLI tool will be prefixed with the current date and time in ISO format. This enhancement improves debugging and log aggregation by providing clear temporal context for each log message, complementing existing features like TIME_LOG and VERBOSE_OUTPUT.

## Implementation Details
### Source File Update (src/lib/main.js):
- Detect the presence of the `--timestamp` flag in the command-line arguments.
- Create a helper function (e.g., `logWithTimestamp(message)`) that retrieves the current time (using `new Date().toISOString()`) and logs the message prefixed by the timestamp.
- Update the logging calls so that if the `--timestamp` flag is provided, both the initial message (e.g., `Run with: ...`) and the execution time log are output using the timestamp format. For example, output:
  ```
  2025-04-20T21:00:00Z - Run with: ["--timestamp", "otherFlag"]
  2025-04-20T21:00:00Z - Execution time: 12.34 ms
  ```
- Ensure that when the flag is not provided, the log output remains unchanged.

### Test File Update (tests/unit/main.test.js):
- Add a new test case simulating CLI invocation with the `--timestamp` flag.
- Spy on `console.log` and verify that each logged output begins with a valid ISO 8601 timestamp (e.g., matches `/^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}T.*Z - .+/`).
- Retain existing tests for other flag invocations to ensure backward compatibility.

### README Update (README.md):
- Update the usage instructions to include the new `--timestamp` flag. For example, add a section:
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --timestamp
  ```
- Explain that when this flag is used, each log message is prefixed with the current timestamp for easier log tracking and debugging.

### Dependencies File Update (package.json):
- No additional dependency is required for this feature.

## Testing & Compatibility
- Run `npm test` to validate that the new test case for `--timestamp` flag passes, confirming that the output contains correctly formatted timestamps.
- Verify that when the flag is omitted, the CLI outputs remain identical to the default behavior.

## Long-Term Considerations
This enhancement lays the groundwork for more advanced logging capabilities, such as configurable log levels and potential integration with logging frameworks or external log aggregation systems in future iterations.features/INTERACTIVE_MODE.md
# features/INTERACTIVE_MODE.md
# INTERACTIVE MODE

## Overview
This feature introduces an interactive mode for the CLI tool. When the `--interactive` flag is provided, the application will prompt the user for input before proceeding with its operations. This enhancement improves usability in situations where confirmation or additional input is needed, especially when certain parameters are missing or when critical operations are about to be executed.

## Implementation Details

### Source File Update (src/lib/main.js):
- **Interactive Prompt:** Import the built-in `readline` module.
- **Flag Detection:** In the `main()` function, check if the CLI arguments include `--interactive`.
- **Prompt Logic:** If the flag is present and the process is running in a TTY environment, create a readline interface and prompt the user with a message such as "Interactive mode active: Press Enter to continue...". Only after the user presses Enter should the program continue with its normal execution flow.
- **Non-blocking Behavior:** Ensure that if the flag is not present or if the environment is non-interactive, the CLI behaves as before.

### Test File Update (tests/unit/main.test.js):
- **Simulated Interactive Input:** Add unit tests that simulate interactive mode by mocking the readline interface. For example, automatically trigger the input callback to simulate the user pressing Enter.
- **Verification:** Assert that when `--interactive` is included in the arguments, the interactive prompt message is logged and subsequent operations (such as logging CLI arguments and execution time) proceed normally.

### README Update (README.md):
- **Documentation:** Update the README to include documentation for the new `--interactive` flag. Provide a usage example:
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --interactive
  ```
- **Description:** Explain that this mode will prompt the user before continuing, making it useful in scenarios where confirmation is desired.

### Dependencies File Update (package.json):
- **No New Dependencies:** This feature leverages Node.js's built-in `readline` module, so no changes to dependencies are needed.

## Testing & Compatibility
- Use `npm test` to ensure the interactive mode tests pass without issues.
- Confirm that in environments where TTY is not available, the interactive prompt is automatically bypassed.

## Future Considerations
- Extend interactive mode to provide more nuanced prompts, such as dynamically requesting missing parameters or offering confirmation dialogs for destructive operations.
- Integrate richer terminal UI elements (while remaining lightweight) in future iterations.
features/REPLICATION.md
# features/REPLICATION.md
# REPLICATION

## Overview
Replication is the trait that allows the agent to duplicate its processes or itself, enabling it to scale its efforts and operate in multiple contexts. In an AGI sense, replication can lead to powerful growth (or risk, if uncontrolled), but here we focus on constructive uses: for instance, having the agent spin off a copy to work on a parallel task, or deploy a part of itself to another environment (like another repository or an AWS Lambda instance). For our JavaScript CLI/Lambda project, implementing replication means the agent gains the ability to reproduce certain functionality in a new instance or location. This trait is useful for tackling tasks that are too large for one process (by splitting workload) or for propagating improvements to new projects. It’s a step toward an ecosystem of cooperating agent instances.

## Implementation Details
- **Simple Replicate Command:** Introduce a special command that triggers replication. For example, if the user provides `{"command": "REPLICATE"}` (or a more descriptive variant like `"replicate to X"`), the `agenticHandler` can handle it uniquely. Implement logic such that when this command is detected, the agent outputs a message like “Replicating agent…” and performs a no-op clone action (to simulate replication). The no-op could be creating a deep copy of some in-memory state or simply invoking a new instance of `agenticHandler` on a trivial test command to demonstrate the concept.
- **Controlled Invocation:** Because actual self-replication (spawning new processes or threads) can be risky, keep this first step minimal. For instance, the replication command might just call a function `replicateAgent()` in `main.js` which logs that replication is not fully implemented yet but would, in a real scenario, initialize a new agent instance. This could be as minimal as copying configuration or re-running the initialization code. The key is to lay the groundwork (the interface and intent) without creating infinite loops or complex concurrency.
- **Guardrails:** Put safeguards around the replication feature. For example, if a replication command is invoked, ensure the agent doesn’t get stuck in a loop of replicating itself. This could mean setting a flag like `globalThis.isReplicating` to prevent nested replication, or ignoring replicate commands if one has just occurred. Also, potentially respect an environment variable (or reuse `featuresWipLimit`) to limit how many active replications can be spawned in a single run (even if our current replication is a stub, this is forward-thinking for when it becomes real).
- **Testing Replication Behavior:** Write tests to simulate the replication command. For example, call `agenticHandler({ command: "REPLICATE" })` and verify that the response is a success with a message indicating replication took place (whatever format we choose, e.g. `response.message === "Replicating agent..."`). If the replication triggers a secondary action (like calling `agenticHandler` internally), ensure that it returns control properly. A test should also assert that no infinite recursion happens (the function returns) and perhaps that some global flag or counter is set as expected. These tests ensure our implementation is safe and behaves predictably.
- **Update README:** In the documentation, add a section about the replication capability. Explain that currently the agent can simulate replicating itself, which in the future will allow it to spawn helpers or deploy to new environments. Mention how to invoke it (maybe a specific JSON payload or a CLI subcommand) and clarify the current limitations (e.g., “This is an experimental feature; the agent won’t actually create a new process yet, but it lays the groundwork for future multi-agent operation.”). This transparency sets the stage for users to understand what to expect.

## Long-Term Direction
Looking ahead, replication could become one of the most powerful features of the agentic system. In a mature state, the agent might actually fork itself: for example, programmatically creating a new container or Lambda function running the same code to handle a different task in parallel. We might implement an **agent cluster**, where a primary agent delegates subtasks to cloned agents and then integrates their results. With an expanding codebase, this could be formalized into an API or SDK that developers use to launch multiple agent instances (each perhaps with a specialization or a part of the project). Additionally, replication across repositories could mean the agent can take a piece of knowledge (say a utility library it wrote) and automatically replicate that into another repository or project that needs it, possibly via generating a pull request on that repo. As this feature grows, safeguards (like requiring human approval for replication or limiting the scope of what gets copied) will be crucial, ensuring that the agent’s ability to multiply remains beneficial and under control.
features/CLEAR_SCREEN.md
# features/CLEAR_SCREEN.md
# CLEAR_SCREEN

## Overview
This feature introduces a new CLI flag `--clear` for the CLI tool. When the `--clear` flag is added, the tool will clear the console before it logs any other messages. This helps improve readability by ensuring that previous logs do not clutter the current output session. This feature is lightweight, achievable in a single repository update affecting only the source file, test file, README, and dependencies files.

## Implementation Details
- **Source File Update (src/lib/main.js):**
  - At the beginning of the `main()` function, check if the CLI arguments include `--clear`.
  - If detected, invoke `console.clear()` to clear the console screen.
  - Continue with the existing logging of arguments and execution time.

- **Test File Update (tests/unit/main.test.js):**
  - Add a test case to simulate passing the `--clear` flag.
  - Spy on `console.clear` to ensure it is called when the flag is present.
  - Also, verify that other outputs (like the JSON formatted argument log and execution time) continue to function normally.

- **README Update (README.md):**
  - Update the usage instructions to document the new `--clear` flag.
  - Provide an example command, e.g., `node src/lib/main.js --clear`, and explain that it clears the screen before outputting logs.

- **Dependencies File Update (package.json):**
  - No additional dependencies are required; the feature uses built-in console methods.

## Testing & Compatibility
- Run `npm test` to ensure that the test case for the `--clear` flag passes without errors.
- Verify that when the flag is provided, the console is cleared before any output is logged and that all other log messages appear in the expected order.

## Future Considerations
- Consider integrating a configuration option to enable or disable this behavior by default in non-interactive environments.
- Additional visual enhancements (such as styled headers after clearing the screen) could be added later to further improve readability.features/PLANNING.md
# features/PLANNING.md
# PLANNING

## Overview
Planning is the agent’s ability to strategize its actions by formulating a sequence of steps before execution. This AGI-aligned trait enables the system to deal with complex tasks by first outlining what needs to be done, rather than diving in blindly. In our JavaScript CLI/Lambda library context, a planning feature means the agent can take a high-level request and map out an ordered list of sub-tasks or checkpoints. This provides clarity on *how* the goal will be achieved and can prevent errors (or unnecessary work) by anticipating the requirements of each step. In essence, planning turns an arbitrary request into a coherent game plan for the agent to follow.

## Implementation Details
- **Plan Mode Trigger:** Introduce a mechanism to activate “planning mode” for the agent. For example, add a CLI flag `--plan` (or reuse the existing `--dry-run` flag) that, when present, causes the program to output a plan of actions *instead of* immediately executing the commands. In `main.js`, check for this flag in the `main` function’s arguments and set a boolean like `planningMode`. When `planningMode` is true, the agent will generate and display the intended steps.
- **Generating a Plan:** Modify `agenticHandler` (or the CLI handling logic) so that if planning mode is on, the input command or goal is analyzed and broken down into sub-steps *without executing them*. A simple implementation could take a compound command (e.g., “do X and then do Y”) and split it by known conjunctions (`and then`) or punctuation. Each part becomes a step in the plan. The agent would then output a structured list of these steps (for example, an array of step descriptions, or just log them in order with a "Plan:" prefix) and skip the actual action execution.
- **Dry-Run Integration:** Leverage the `--dry-run` flag (documented in README) as a planning tool. Currently, `--dry-run` likely prevents side-effects; we can extend it so that it not only avoids making changes but explicitly prints out what *would* have been done. For instance, if the input is a batch of commands, the dry-run output can list each command with a message “(dry-run) Would execute: [command]”. This repurposes an existing feature for planning, keeping changes minimal.
- **Testing the Plan:** Add unit tests to confirm planning behavior. One test could call the CLI entry (`agenticLib.main`) with `--plan` and a sample command, then inspect the console output (using a spy) to ensure it contains an ordered list of sub-actions rather than actual results. Another test could verify that in planning mode the agent does not modify any state (e.g., `globalThis.callCount` remains zero if we decide not to count planned actions). If using `--dry-run` for this, ensure a test covers that dry-run now outputs the plan messages.
- **README Updates:** In README.md, describe how to use the planning mode. Provide an example: “Using the `--plan` flag will show the steps the agent intends to take. For example: `node src/lib/main.js --plan --agentic '{"command": "do X and then do Y"}'` might output a plan like 1) do X, 2) do Y, without executing them.” This helps users understand the new capability. Also clarify that this is an initial planning feature – it creates a straightforward sequence from the input, but does not involve elaborate AI reasoning yet.

## Long-Term Direction
As this planning feature matures, the agent can move from simple static splitting of commands towards AI-driven planning. In the future, the agent could use the language model itself to generate an optimal plan given a complex goal (incorporating something like a chain-of-thought prompt where the model lists steps before execution). With a larger context window available, the agent could take into account its entire memory and mission when planning, leading to more globally coherent strategies. Moreover, planning could be extended to multi-session scenarios – for instance, planning an upgrade over several GitHub issues/commits. We might also see an **orchestration layer** or a forked planning SDK that allows the agent to coordinate plans across multiple agents or services. Ultimately, robust planning will ensure the agent tackles tasks methodically, improving reliability for complex, multi-faceted development objectives.
features/TIME_LOG.md
# features/TIME_LOG.md
# TIME_LOG

## Overview
This feature enhances the CLI tool by adding execution time logging. The agent will record the start time when the command is initiated and calculate the total execution duration when it completes. Optionally, when the `--time` flag is provided among the command-line arguments, the CLI will output detailed timing information. This capability aids in performance diagnostics and serves as a stepping stone towards more advanced self-improvement metrics.

## Implementation Details
- **Source File Update (src/lib/main.js):**
  - At the beginning of the `main()` function, record a timestamp (e.g. using `Date.now()`).
  - After executing the CLI logic, compute the elapsed time and log this duration.
  - If `--time` is detected in the arguments, print detailed timing information; otherwise, log a simple message with the total execution time.

- **Test File Update (tests/unit/main.test.js):**
  - Add a test case that simulates running `main()` with the `--time` flag.
  - Capture the console output and verify that it includes a valid execution duration (e.g., a numeric value or a message containing the word "ms").

- **README Update (README.md):**
  - Document the new `--time` flag and provide an example command, such as:
    ```bash
    node src/lib/main.js --time
    ```
  - Explain that this flag enables detailed execution time logging to assist with performance insights.

- **Dependencies File Update (package.json):**
  - No additional dependencies are required for this feature.

## Testing & Compatibility
- Run `npm test` to ensure that the timing log output is correctly produced in both default and `--time` modes.
- Confirm that the default behavior remains unchanged when the flag is omitted.

## Long-Term Considerations
This modest enhancement lays the groundwork for more comprehensive self-improvement features, such as tracking performance metrics over multiple runs or integrating with diagnostic dashboards.
features/JSON_OUTPUT.md
# features/JSON_OUTPUT.md
# JSON_OUTPUT

## Overview
This feature adds a JSON output mode to the CLI tool. When the `--json` flag is provided, the tool will format its output as a structured JSON object (instead of plain text). This machine-parsable output is ideal for integrations, logging systems, or further automated processing.

## Implementation Details
- **Source File Update (src/lib/main.js):**
  - Enhance the main function to check for the presence of the `--json` flag in the command-line arguments.
  - When `--json` is detected, wrap the output message in a JSON structure. For example, instead of `console.log(`Run with: ${JSON.stringify(args)}`)`, output `console.log(JSON.stringify({ message: 'Run with', args: args }))`.
  - Ensure that regular execution still logs in the default style when `--json` is not provided.

- **Test File Update (tests/unit/main.test.js):**
  - Add a test case that simulates running the program with the `--json` flag.
  - Capture the console output and assert that it is valid JSON (e.g. using `JSON.parse`) and contains the expected keys such as "message" and "args".

- **README Update (README.md):**
  - Update the usage instructions to document the new `--json` flag. Provide a sample command, e.g., `node src/lib/main.js --json`, and explain that it outputs machine-readable JSON for further processing.

- **Dependencies File Update (package.json):**
  - No additional dependencies are required for this feature.

## Testing & Compatibility
- Run `npm test` to ensure that the test case for the JSON output mode passes without error.
- Verify that in environments where the flag is omitted, the CLI continues to display the default output style, ensuring backward compatibility.
features/PERFORMANCE_REPORT.md
# features/PERFORMANCE_REPORT.md
# PERFORMANCE_REPORT

## Overview
This feature enables the CLI tool to generate a detailed performance report in JSON format. When the user includes the `--performance-report` flag, the tool aggregates the execution metrics (average, maximum, minimum, standard deviation, median execution times, and total invocations) from the in-memory log and outputs a structured JSON report to a file named `performance_report.json`. It also prints a summary to the console for immediate feedback.

## Implementation Details
### Source File Update (src/lib/main.js):
- **Flag Detection:**
  - Check if `--performance-report` is present among the CLI arguments.
- **Metrics Aggregation:**
  - Reuse the logic from the self-improvement diagnostics to calculate the performance metrics, but structure them into a JSON object.
- **Report Generation:**
  - Format the metrics into a JSON object, including:
    - Total invocations
    - First and latest invocation timestamps
    - Average execution time
    - Maximum execution time
    - Minimum execution time
    - Standard deviation
    - Median execution time
  - Write the JSON object to a file named `performance_report.json` using Node's `fs.writeFileSync`.
- **Console Output:**
  - Print a summary message indicating that the performance report has been generated.

### Test File Update (tests/unit/main.test.js):
- **New Test Cases:**
  - Simulate CLI invocation with the `--performance-report` flag.
  - Spy on `console.log` to verify that the report summary is printed.
  - After execution, check that `performance_report.json` is created and contains a valid JSON object with the expected keys.

### README Update (README.md):
- **Documentation:**
  - Update the README to include a new section under "Usage" that describes the `--performance-report` flag.
  - Provide an example command:
    ```bash
    node src/lib/main.js --performance-report
    ```
  - Explain that this command generates a detailed JSON report of CLI performance metrics and saves it to `performance_report.json`.

### Dependencies File Update (package.json):
- **No Additional Dependencies Required:**
  - The implementation leverages Node's built-in modules (like `fs`) and does not add any external dependencies.

## Testing & Compatibility
- Run `npm test` to ensure that the performance report is generated correctly and that the JSON file contains valid information.
- Verify that the CLI outputs a summary message to the console and that the report file is created in the repository root.

## Future Considerations
- Enhance the report by including historical data across CLI invocations (if persistent storage is added in a future iteration).
- Consider integrating automatic submission of the performance report to an external monitoring service.
- Expand the report with additional metrics such as memory usage if needed in future versions.
features/EXCEPTION_TRACKING.md
# features/EXCEPTION_TRACKING.md
# EXCEPTION_TRACKING

## Overview
This feature enhances the CLI agent's robustness by capturing unhandled exceptions and integrating detailed error tracking into the CLI workflow. When an exception occurs (for example, in a command action), the agent will intercept the error, log a formatted error message with a stack trace to the in-memory log, and provide user-friendly output. This enables better diagnostics and facilitates help-seeking behavior when unexpected errors occur.

## Implementation Details
- **Source File Update (src/lib/main.js):**
  - Wrap the main execution flow in a try/catch block to intercept any unhandled exceptions.
  - In the catch block, capture the error message and stack trace and append these details to the memory log along with a timestamp.
  - Log a formatted error message to the console that advises the user to run in help-seeking mode if persistent issues occur.
  - Integrate a command-line flag (e.g., `--track-exceptions`) that, when used, enables enhanced exception tracking. This flag can also trigger additional logging output for diagnostics.

- **Test File Update (tests/unit/main.test.js):**
  - Add unit tests to simulate exceptions thrown during command processing to ensure that error details (message and stack trace) are correctly appended to the memory log.
  - Verify that the exception tracking output includes expected patterns (e.g., presence of the error message, stack trace text, and a user help advisory).

- **README Update (README.md):**
  - Update usage documentation to include the new `--track-exceptions` flag.
  - Provide an example command:
    ```bash
    node src/lib/main.js --track-exceptions
    ```
  - Explain that with this flag, any unexpected errors will be captured, logged with detailed diagnostics, and users will receive guidance to seek help.

## Future Considerations
- Enhance the exception tracking to automatically persist error logs to an external monitoring tool or a file (integrating with LOG_PERSISTENCE).
- Extend the error handler to trigger a help-seeking mechanism or create alerts (e.g., open an issue in GitHub) when repeated failures occur.
- Improve integration with self-improvement by analyzing error patterns over time and suggesting fixes or refactors.
features/CLI_ROUTER.md
# features/CLI_ROUTER.md
# CLI_ROUTER

## Overview
This feature enhances the agent’s command line interface (CLI) by introducing a robust flag processing mechanism in the main entry point. The new CLI router will inspect process arguments, identify supported flags such as --diagnostics, --plan, and --help, and route execution accordingly. This improvement ensures that users can toggle advanced modes (e.g., self-check, planning) while maintaining a clear and consolidated entry point in a single source file.

## Implementation Details
- **Flag Parsing:** Modify the `src/lib/main.js` file to parse `process.argv`. The router will check for the presence of specific flags:
  - `--diagnostics`: Trigger self-diagnostic procedures (e.g., output internal metrics and state summary).
  - `--plan`: Activate planning mode to display the steps that would be executed rather than performing actions.
  - `--help`: Output usage information and explain all available flags.
  - Fallback behavior: If no recognized flag is provided, continue with the default behavior of logging input arguments.

- **Routing Logic:** Implement a conditional block in `main()` that routes the execution backend based on the flags. This keeps the code modular and allows easy extension for future modes.

- **Minimal Footprint:** Ensure that the changes are limited to the following files:
  - `src/lib/main.js` (source logic for flag processing)
  - `tests/unit/main.test.js` (unit tests to validate the expected behavior for each supported flag)
  - `README.md` (update usage and examples)
  - `package.json` (if necessary, update scripts section to reference new help text if needed)

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests:** Update `tests/unit/main.test.js` to cover the new routing logic. Tests should simulate different CLI arguments (e.g., `--diagnostics`, `--plan`, `--help`) and validate that the output contains the expected messages or usage information.

- **Edge Cases:** Verify that if multiple flags are present, the highest priority flag (as defined by the documentation) is executed. If no known flags are present, the default output is generated.

## Documentation
- **README Updates:** Enhance the README file to include a new section that documents the CLI usage. Include examples on how to use each flag:

  ```bash
  # Default execution
  node src/lib/main.js

  # Diagnostics mode
  node src/lib/main.js --diagnostics

  # Planning mode
  node src/lib/main.js --plan

  # Help output
  node src/lib/main.js --help
  ```

- **Usage Guidelines:** Document how the router integrates with existing self-improvement, planning, and help-seeking features so that users understand the available capabilities and the priority of each flag.

## Future Enhancements
- Extend the router to allow more complex command structures and combinations of flags.
- Integrate better error handling when unsupported flags are provided.
- Consider modularizing the flag processing logic into a separate helper function within the same file for easier testing and future refactoring.
features/COMMAND_ALIAS.md
# features/COMMAND_ALIAS.md
# COMMAND_ALIAS

## Overview

The COMMAND_ALIAS feature introduces support for predefined command aliases within the CLI tool. This allows users to invoke commonly used commands using shorthand flags, improving usability and speed. For example, instead of typing the full flag (e.g. "--self-improve"), a user can simply type a designated alias (e.g. "DEBUG"). This feature seamlessly integrates alias expansion into the existing argument processing logic.

## Implementation Details

### Source File Update (src/lib/main.js):
- **Alias Mapping:**
  - Define a constant alias mapping object at the top of the file, for example:
    ```js
    const aliasMapping = {
      "DEBUG": "--self-improve",
      "REPLICATE_ALL": "--replicate",
      "PLAN_IT": "--plan",
      "DECOMP": "--decompose"
    };
    ```
- **Alias Expansion:**
  - At the start of the `main(args)` function, iterate over the `args` array to check if any argument matches a key in `aliasMapping`.
  - Replace any matching alias with its corresponding full flag value.
  - Optionally, log a message indicating that an alias was expanded for transparency. For example:
    ```js
    args = args.map(arg => aliasMapping[arg] ? aliasMapping[arg] : arg);
    ```

### Test File Update (tests/unit/main.test.js):
- **New Test Cases:**
  - Add tests to simulate alias usage. For instance, when passing `["DEBUG"]` as arguments, the CLI should behave as if `--self-improve` was provided.
  - Verify through spies on `console.log` that the alias expansion occurred and that the expected outputs (diagnostics for self-improvement) are logged.

### README Update (README.md):
- **Documentation:**
  - Update the README to include a section documenting the new alias feature. Provide examples such as:
    ```bash
    node src/lib/main.js DEBUG
    ```
  - Explain that the following aliases are available:
    - `DEBUG` maps to `--self-improve`
    - `REPLICATE_ALL` maps to `--replicate`
    - `PLAN_IT` maps to `--plan`
    - `DECOMP` maps to `--decompose`

## Testing & Compatibility

- Run `npm test` to ensure all tests pass, including the new alias tests.
- Verify that existing long-form commands work as expected and that alias expansion does not interfere with other functionality.
- Ensure that no new dependencies are introduced and that all modifications are confined to the source file, test file, and README.
features/ENV_VALIDATION.md
# features/ENV_VALIDATION.md
# ENV_VALIDATION

## Overview
This feature adds an environment validation mode to the CLI tool. When the `--env` flag is provided, the tool will load configuration from environment variables using the existing `dotenv` package and verify that required environment variables (e.g. `OPENAI_API_KEY`) are present. This immediate check aids in ensuring that the agent runs with all required settings, avoiding runtime errors due to missing configurations.

## Implementation Details
- **Source File Update (src/lib/main.js):**
  - Import and configure `dotenv` at the beginning of the CLI execution if the `--env` flag is detected.
  - In the main function, check if `--env` is part of the arguments. If so, load environment variables using `require('dotenv').config()` and verify the presence of `process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY` (or any other required variables).
  - Output a message indicating whether the environment is correctly configured or not, and exit after validation.

- **Test File Update (tests/unit/main.test.js):**
  - Add a test case that simulates running the program with the `--env` flag.
  - This test should temporarily set or unset the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable and capture the CLI output to assert that the correct validation message is printed.

- **README Update (README.md):**
  - Update the usage section to document the new `--env` flag. Include an example command such as:
    ```bash
    node src/lib/main.js --env
    ```
  - Explain that this mode performs a check on critical environment variables before proceeding with normal execution.

- **Dependencies File Update (package.json):**
  - No additional dependencies are required, as the feature leverages the existing `dotenv` package.

## Testing & Compatibility
- Run `npm test` to include unit tests for environment validation mode.
- Verify that when the environment variable is missing, the CLI outputs a clear error message and advises on setting the variable.
- Confirm that when all required variables are set, the CLI indicates that the environment is properly configured.
features/LIVE_UPDATE.md
# features/LIVE_UPDATE.md
# LIVE_UPDATE

## Overview
This feature adds a live update capability to the CLI tool. When the `--live-update` flag is provided, the tool will monitor a configuration file (for example, a JSON file or `.env`) for changes. Upon detecting any modification, the tool will dynamically reload its configuration settings and update its in-memory state accordingly. This ensures that updates to configuration parameters can be applied on the fly without needing to restart the CLI application.

## Implementation Details
- **Source File (src/lib/main.js):**
  - Import Node's `fs` module (already in use) and add a file watcher (using `fs.watch`) to monitor a designated configuration file (e.g., `config.json` or `.env`).
  - When the file changes, invoke a helper function `reloadConfig()` that reads the updated file (synchronously or asynchronously) and logs a confirmation message such as "Configuration reloaded successfully.".
  - Optionally, update relevant in-memory settings that the CLI tool uses (for example, log formatting or operational flags).
  - Guard the file watcher activation by checking if the `--live-update` flag exists among CLI arguments.

- **Test File (tests/unit/main.test.js):**
  - Add new test cases that simulate the `--live-update` flag. Use mocks or spies for `fs.watch` to simulate a file change event and verify that the reload function is called and that a log message confirming the configuration reload is output.
  - Ensure that the file update handler does not interrupt or interfere with the normal CLI output, and that existing behavior remains intact without the flag.

- **README Update (README.md):**
  - Update the usage instructions to document the new `--live-update` flag. Provide an example command:
    ```bash
    node src/lib/main.js --live-update
    ```
  - Explain that in live update mode, the CLI tool watches a configuration file for changes and automatically reloads settings in real time.

- **Dependencies File (package.json):**
  - No additional external dependencies are required since Node’s built-in `fs.watch` is sufficient for monitoring file changes.

## Testing & Compatibility
- Run `npm test` to verify that tests for live update behavior pass without errors.
- Confirm that when the configuration file is updated, the CLI outputs the expected reload confirmation message, and that normal CLI operations are maintained.

## Future Considerations
- Enhance this feature to allow multiple configuration files (e.g., supporting both a JSON config and a `.env` file) to be monitored concurrently.
- Consider adding debounce logic to prevent excessive reloads on rapid file changes.
- In further iterations, integration with a persistent storage or remote configuration service could be explored to allow dynamic updates across distributed agent instances.
features/VERSION.md
# features/VERSION.md
# VERSION

## Overview
This feature adds a version output functionality to the CLI tool. When invoked with the `--version` flag, the agent will output the current version of the repository (read from the package configuration) and exit. This enhancement provides a quick reference for users and aids in verifying that the correct version of the tool is in use.

## Implementation Details

### Source File Update
- Modify `src/lib/main.js` to inspect the provided CLI arguments.
- If the argument `--version` is present, output the version (e.g., "1.2.0-0") as defined in the project's package.json file. For simplicity, the version string can be hard-coded or imported from the package configuration if available.
- Ensure that the version output is styled appropriately using basic Chalk styling (if the STYLING feature is integrated) or plain text if not.

### Test File Update
- Update `tests/unit/main.test.js` to include a test case invoking `main()` with the `--version` argument. The test should verify that the output includes the expected version string and that the function terminates without errors.

### README Update
- Update the `README.md` file to document the new `--version` flag. Provide an example command such as `node src/lib/main.js --version` and describe what output users should expect.

### Dependencies File Update
- No additional dependencies are required for this feature.

## Benefits and Alignment
- This feature provides immediate version awareness, aiding in debugging and version management.
- It aligns well with the mission of providing a clear, informative interface for users as part of the broader agentic automation system.

## Long-Term Considerations
- Future enhancements could include dynamically reading the version from package.json to avoid hard-coding the value.
- Additional flags like `--help` or more detailed information may be integrated into this routing logic in subsequent iterations.
features/SERVER_MODE.md
# features/SERVER_MODE.md
# SERVER_MODE

## Overview
This feature introduces a server mode for the CLI tool by adding a new flag `--serve`. When invoked with `--serve`, the application will start an HTTP server using Node’s built-in modules. The server will listen on a predefined port (e.g., 3000) and provide a simple JSON response that indicates the service is running. This feature enhances the agentic behavior by allowing the tool to operate as a lightweight HTTP server for diagnostics or remote control.

## Implementation Details
- **Source File Update (src/lib/main.js):**
  - Add a new conditional branch in the main function to detect the `--serve` flag.
  - When the flag is detected, initialize an HTTP server using Node’s built-in `http` module.
  - The server will listen on port `3000` (or a configurable port) and return a JSON response for requests made to the root endpoint. Example response: `{ "status": "Server running", "timestamp": <current_time> }`.
  - Ensure that if the server mode is active, other CLI processing is bypassed or appropriately deferred.

- **Test File Update (tests/unit/main.test.js):**
  - Add a test case simulating a CLI invocation with the `--serve` flag.
  - Mock or capture `console.log` outputs to ensure that the expected startup message (e.g., "Server started on port 3000") is logged.
  - Optionally, simulate an HTTP request to the server and assert that it returns the correct JSON response.

- **README Update (README.md):**
  - Document the new `--serve` flag under the Usage section with an example command:
    ```bash
    node src/lib/main.js --serve
    ```
  - Explain that server mode starts a lightweight HTTP server that can be used for diagnostics or remote control.

- **Dependencies File Update (package.json):**
  - No additional external dependencies are required because the implementation utilizes Node’s built-in `http` module.

## Testing & Compatibility
- Run `npm test` to verify that the new server mode test case passes.
- Manually test by running `node src/lib/main.js --serve` and accessing `http://localhost:3000/` to see the JSON response.
- Ensure that in non-server mode, the CLI behaves as before.

## Future Considerations
- Make the server port configurable via an environment variable or a command-line parameter.
- Expand the server endpoints to expose additional agentic diagnostics or control functions.
- Integrate security features (e.g., basic authentication) if the server is to be exposed in less secure environments.features/MEMORY.md
# features/MEMORY.md
# MEMORY

## Overview
Memory is the agent’s capability to retain and utilize information from past events or interactions. By equipping the CLI/Lambda agent with a form of memory, it can remember previous commands, results, or context across its operations. This trait enhances consistency and enables learning over time – for example, recalling what changes were made earlier or what issues were previously encountered. In practical terms, implementing memory means the agent won’t always start from scratch; it can accumulate a knowledge base (even if simple) to inform its future decisions within a single run or even across runs.

## Implementation Details
- **In-Memory Log:** Introduce a global memory structure (e.g. `globalThis.memoryLog = []`) in `main.js` that records key details of each processed command. After each successful command execution in `agenticHandler`, append an entry containing information like the command name, a timestamp, and a brief result summary. This provides a running log of the agent’s activity that functions as its short-term memory.
- **Context Utilization:** Modify the command processing so that before executing a new command, the agent can optionally consult `memoryLog`. For instance, if a command is similar to a recent one, the agent could warn or adjust (initially, this might simply be noted for future use). This ensures the memory isn’t just stored but is available for use in decision-making (even if the initial step is just to make the data accessible).
- **Testing the Memory:** Add unit tests in `main.test.js` to verify memory behavior. For example, after running a sequence of two or three commands via `agenticHandler` (perhaps by simulating a batch of commands), check that `globalThis.memoryLog` contains the corresponding number of entries and that each entry has the expected command name. Another test could execute two identical commands in a row and (in a future scenario) ensure the agent recognizes the repetition via the memory log – but for now, simply confirm the log is accumulating records correctly.
- **README Update:** Document the new memory feature in the README.md. Explain that the agent keeps an internal log of actions during execution, and describe how a developer can access or reset this memory (e.g., noting that `memoryLog` resets each new run unless persisted). While this initial memory is ephemeral (lasting only per process), clarify its purpose and lay the groundwork for more persistent memory in the future.
- **No New Dependencies:** This memory mechanism can be implemented with plain JavaScript objects/arrays. There’s no need for an external database or file at this stage, keeping the implementation simple and within the current project’s scope (just updating `main.js` and tests accordingly).

## Long-Term Direction
In the long run, the memory trait can evolve from a basic log into a sophisticated memory module. Future enhancements might include persistent memory across runs (for example, saving `memoryLog` to a file or cloud storage at the end of execution and loading it at the start of the next run). With anticipated larger context windows (e.g., models handling 100k+ lines of input), the agent could even summarize and feed relevant memory back into the prompt for context-aware reasoning. As the codebase grows, one could imagine a forked memory SDK or integration with a vector database to allow semantic search of past interactions. The goal is for the agent to develop **long-term memory** – remembering important details from weeks or months of activity – thereby becoming more effective and personalized over time.

features/GOAL_DECOMPOSITION.md
# features/GOAL_DECOMPOSITION.md
# GOAL_DECOMPOSITION

## Overview
Goal Decomposition is the agent’s ability to break down a complex objective into simpler, actionable parts. This trait is closely related to planning, but specifically focuses on parsing an initial high-level goal into discrete tasks. In practice, it means the agent can take something broad – for example, “implement a new feature and write documentation” – and split it into individual steps like “implement feature (code)”, “write tests for feature”, “update README with usage”. By doing so, each sub-task can be tackled with the existing capabilities of the agent. For our CLI/Lambda, goal decomposition ensures that even if a user or system gives a compound instruction, the agent won’t be overwhelmed; it will handle each piece in a logical order. This increases the likelihood of success and makes debugging easier since each step can be verified.

## Implementation Details
- **Input Parsing for Sub-Tasks:** Update `agenticHandler` to recognize when a single-command input actually contains multiple instructions. A straightforward approach is to look for delimiters in the command string. For example, if `payload.command` is a string and contains a semicolon (`;`) or the word “then”, we can treat it as multiple commands. Implement a parser that splits the string on these delimiters into an array of strings (trimming whitespace). Each segment becomes its own command.
- **Batch Execution Reuse:** Once the command is split into sub-commands, reuse the existing batch processing logic. For instance, if the input was `{ command: "do A; then do B" }`, after splitting, programmatically call `agenticHandler({ commands: ["do A", "do B"] })` internally. This way, we leverage the already-tested batch execution flow (sequentially processing each command and aggregating results) without reinventing how to run multiple steps. The agent thus effectively decomposes the goal and immediately carries out the parts one by one.
- **Compound Goal Format:** Alternatively (or additionally), allow a more structured input for goals. For example, if a JSON payload comes in as `{ "goal": "Set up database and API", "steps": [] }`, the agent could detect the `goal` field and apply a decomposition strategy (possibly using a preset template or a simple AI prompt) to fill in the `"steps"` array, then execute them. For now, this can be a stub: if `goal` is provided, log that the feature is recognized but advise using a semicolon-separated commands string until the feature matures.
- **Tests for Decomposition:** Implement unit tests for goal decomposition. One test case: input a single string with two tasks separated by “and then” and verify that `agenticHandler` returns a composite result that includes results for each part in order (and that `globalThis.callCount` increments appropriately for each sub-task). Another test: provide a payload with a `goal` property (instead of `command` or `commands`) and check that the agent doesn’t crash and gives a useful message (since full support might not be complete yet). The tests ensure that multi-part inputs are handled gracefully.
- **README Examples:** Update the README.md to guide users on using this feature. For instance: “The agent can handle compound commands. You can separate tasks with semicolons or the phrase 'then'. Example: `--agentic "{\"command\": \"build the project; then deploy it\"}"` will cause the agent to treat “build the project” and “deploy it” as two separate commands and execute them sequentially.” Also mention any caveats (e.g., it’s best to use clear separators as natural language might not always split correctly). This educates users on how to leverage goal decomposition with the current implementation.

## Long-Term Direction
As the agent evolves, goal decomposition can become more intelligent and less reliant on manual separators. In the future, the agent could use NLP techniques or even an LLM call to truly understand a goal expressed in natural language and break it into structured tasks. This might involve identifying prerequisites, parallelizable tasks, and conditional steps. We could integrate a planning AI module that reads a goal and returns a checklist of sub-goals (very much like how a human project planner would). On a larger scale, goal decomposition could allow the agent to translate a high-level feature request (perhaps coming from an issue ticket or user story) into multiple GitHub issues or PRs across different services – effectively spreading the work across different parts of a system. This trait, combined with replication and planning, paves the way for **auto-orchestration** of complex projects: the agent not only figures out what needs to be done, but can also distribute those tasks to where they need to be done, within or even across repositories.
features/SELF_IMPROVEMENT.md
# features/SELF_IMPROVEMENT.md
# SELF_IMPROVEMENT

## Overview
Self-improvement is the agent’s capacity to evaluate and enhance its own performance over time. This trait allows the system to not only execute tasks but also reflect on how well it did and how it could do better next time – a stepping stone toward an autonomous, improving AI. In our project’s context, self-improvement means the CLI/Lambda agent can perform self-diagnostics and make adjustments or surface suggestions without explicit external commands. This could involve monitoring its success/failure rates, ensuring its dependencies are up to date, or recognizing when its approach to a problem isn’t effective. By implementing even a simple form of self-improvement, we ensure the agent isn’t a static tool, but one that actively seeks to refine and optimize its behavior with each iteration.

## Implementation Details
- **Diagnostics Command:** Add a new CLI flag (e.g. `--self-check` or extend the existing `--diagnostics`) that makes the agent perform an internal audit. In `main.js`, when this mode is triggered, skip normal command processing and instead output a summary of the agent’s state: for example, how many commands it has processed (`globalThis.callCount`), how many errors occurred in this run, and whether all tests are currently passing (if accessible). The agent can simply log something like “Self-Check: X commands executed, 0 errors, environment OK” and then exit. This gives users a way to see a quick health report of the agent.
- **Runtime Self-Metrics:** Augment the agent’s execution flow to track simple performance metrics. For instance, maintain a counter for errors or unsuccessful operations (e.g., `globalThis.errorCount`). Each time `agenticHandler` encounters an invalid input or an exception, increment this. Similarly, keep track of improvements like number of fixes applied. These metrics can be included in the agent’s output (perhaps in the `--status` JSON output or when the diagnostics flag is used) so that there’s feedback on how the agent is doing.
- **Automatic Suggestions:** Implement a basic rule-based feedback at the end of a run. After processing a batch of commands, if certain conditions are met (for example, `errorCount > 0` or a command took an unusually long time), have the agent output a suggestion for improvement. This could be as simple as: “Suggestion: Consider reviewing the failed commands or increasing the MAX_BATCH_COMMANDS limit if tasks were truncated.” While the agent isn’t rewriting itself yet, it’s beginning to point out areas for improvement in its usage or configuration.
- **Testing Self-Check:** Write unit tests to validate the self-improvement hooks. One test can invoke the agent with the self-check/diagnostics flag and assert that the output contains expected keys (like “commands executed” or a version number). Another test can simulate an error (perhaps by calling `agenticHandler` with an invalid command) then call the status function to ensure `errorCount` reflects that error and that a suggestion message is present. This ensures the groundwork for self-monitoring is functioning.
- **README Documentation:** Update README.md to introduce the concept of the agent’s self-improvement. Document the new flag (if added) and show an example output of a self-diagnostic run. Explain that the agent tracks its calls and errors, and how a developer might use that information (e.g., to decide when to intervene or adjust parameters). By clarifying this, users understand that the system is semi-autonomous and keeping an eye on its own behavior.

## Long-Term Direction
The long-term vision for self-improvement is an agent that can truly modify its own code or strategy in response to experience – **recursive self-enhancement**. In future iterations, the agent might automatically refactor parts of its codebase if it detects inefficiencies (for example, it could open a pull request to optimize a function that frequently causes slowdowns). It could also use machine learning to adjust its prompts or choose better tools based on past outcomes. As the context limit grows, the agent could maintain a history of past actions and outcomes, analyze this history with an LLM, and derive insights (like “I tend to fail on networking tasks, maybe I should use a different library”). Eventually, a forked “Auto-Improver” module or API could be developed to systematically test and fine-tune the agent’s performance (similar to continuous integration for AI behavior). The end goal is an agent that gets smarter and more efficient the more it’s used, requiring less human tuning as time goes on.
features/AUTO_UPDATE.md
# features/AUTO_UPDATE.md
# AUTO_UPDATE

## Overview
This feature adds an auto-update check to the CLI tool. When the user runs the tool with the `--update` flag, the CLI will query the npm registry to determine if a newer version of the tool is available. This capability ensures that users are informed about available updates, helping keep the tool secure and up-to-date with the latest improvements.

## Implementation Details

### Source File Update (src/lib/main.js)
- At the start of the `main` function, check if the arguments contain `--update`.
- When `--update` is detected, use Node's built-in `https` module to perform a GET request to the npm registry endpoint (e.g., `https://registry.npmjs.org/@xn-intenton-z2a/repository0-crucible`) to fetch package metadata.
- Extract the latest version from the fetched data and compare it to the current version (read from the local `package.json`).
- Log a message indicating whether the tool is up-to-date or if a newer version is available.
- Exit after performing the update check so that no further commands are executed during the update process.

### Test File Update (tests/unit/main.test.js)
- Add a new test case simulating the CLI invocation with the `--update` flag.
- Mock the network request (using a library like `vi` mocking capabilities) to return a predetermined version (either greater than or equal to the current version).
- Capture `console.log` output and assert that it includes a message such as "Tool is up-to-date" or "Update available: version X.X.X".

### README Update (README.md)
- Update the usage instructions to document the new `--update` flag.
- Provide an example command:
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --update
  ```
- Explain that this command checks the online npm registry for any available updates and notifies the user of the status.

### Dependencies File Update (package.json)
- No new external dependencies are required since the feature leverages Node’s built-in modules.

## Testing & Compatibility
- Run the tool with the `--update` flag and observe that an appropriate update check message is logged.
- Verify that normal CLI operations remain unaffected when the flag is not provided.

## Long-Term Considerations
- This feature lays the groundwork for future enhancements such as automated downloading and installation of updates.
- In later iterations, the tool may inform the user with a prompt to update or even trigger a self-update mechanism if desired.
features/LOG_PERSISTENCE.md
# features/LOG_PERSISTENCE.md
# LOG_PERSISTENCE

## Overview
This feature enhances the existing memory logging capability by persisting CLI execution logs to disk. When the CLI tool is executed with the `--persist-log` flag, the tool will check for an environment variable (e.g., `PERSIST_LOG_FILE`) that specifies a file path. If set, the tool writes the JSON formatted memory log to that file instead of (or in addition to) printing it to the console. This ensures a durable record of executions, which is useful for diagnostics, historical analysis, and further automation workflows.

## Implementation Details
- **Source File Update (src/lib/main.js):**
  - Modify the `--persist-log` block to detect if the environment variable `PERSIST_LOG_FILE` is set.
  - If set, import Node's `fs` module and write the JSON-stringified memory log into the specified file using an asynchronous or synchronous file write method. Use proper error handling (try/catch) so that failures in writing do not crash the CLI.
  - Maintain the existing behavior (printing to console) as a fallback if the environment variable is not provided.

- **Test File Update (tests/unit/main.test.js):**
  - Extend tests to simulate both scenarios: when `PERSIST_LOG_FILE` is set and when it is not.
  - When set, verify that a confirmation message (or detectable file write behavior) occurs. This can be done by mocking the file system module methods (`fs.writeFileSync` or similar) to ensure they are called with the expected parameters.
  - When not set, ensure that the output remains the JSON string written to the console as before.

- **README Update (README.md):**
  - Update the usage documentation to include the new log persistence functionality. Explain that users can persist their in-memory logs by setting the environment variable `PERSIST_LOG_FILE` to the desired file path.
  - Provide an example command:
    ```bash
    PERSIST_LOG_FILE=./persisted_log.json node src/lib/main.js --persist-log
    ```
  - Mention that if the variable is not set, the log will simply be printed to the console.

- **Dependencies File Update (package.json):**
  - No new dependencies are required since the implementation uses Node.js's built-in `fs` module.

## Testing & Compatibility
- Run `npm test` to ensure all test cases pass. Check that both the console output and file writing behavior are correct under different environment settings.
- Ensure that the default behavior is preserved for users who do not require log persistence.

## Future Considerations
- Enhance the feature with log rotation and archiving capabilities, ensuring that logs do not grow indefinitely.
- Introduce configurable log formats (e.g., CSV, XML) for integration with external logging systems.
- Provide more granular error reporting if the log file write operation fails.

## Alignment with Mission
By allowing persistent logs, the agentic system gains a reliable historical record of its operations. This persistence supports self-improvement and diagnostic capabilities by enabling cross-run analysis. It lays the groundwork for eventual enhancements, such as automated log-based alerting and performance trending over time.features/STYLING.md
# features/STYLING.md
# STYLING

## Overview
This feature enhances the CLI output by integrating colored and styled text using the Chalk library. With STYLING, the agent's console messages (such as help output, diagnostics, and standard logs) become more visually distinct and user friendly. This improvement aligns with our mission of creating an agent that not only functions effectively but also provides a clear, informative interface.

## Implementation Details
- **Source File Update:**
  - Import the Chalk library in `src/lib/main.js` using either the ES Module syntax: `import chalk from 'chalk';`.
  - Replace plain `console.log` output with styled messages. For example, use `chalk.green('Success message')` for regular output and `chalk.red('Error message')` where appropriate.
  - Ensure that flag-based outputs (like `--help` or `--diagnostics`) are also enhanced with color cues.

- **Test File Update:**
  - In `tests/unit/main.test.js`, add tests to verify that the output includes ANSI escape sequences (indicative of Chalk's styling) when a version of enhanced output is expected.
  - These tests should not break the existing behavior but check for the presence of color codes in the output log.

- **README Update:**
  - Update `README.md` to document the new STYLING feature. Include instructions on how the CLI now renders colored output and benefits for quick identification of statuses (info, error, help, etc.). For example, add a section that shows sample command outputs with color commentary.

- **Dependencies File Update:**
  - Update `package.json` to include the Chalk library as a dependency. This reinforces the use of Chalk for terminal styling. Use an appropriate version that matches compatibility (e.g. "chalk": "^5.0.0").

## Testing & Compatibility
- Run `npm test` to ensure that the ANSI codes appear in the CLI outputs during testing scenarios.
- Ensure that the use of Chalk does not affect non-TTY environments. The implementation should rely on Chalk’s built-in auto-detection to disable styling when needed.

## Long-Term Considerations
Integrating STYLING now lays the groundwork for further enhancements in the CLI user interface. Future iterations may include dynamic theme selection or additional styling modes for different runtime environments.
features/ENHANCED_STYLING.md
# features/ENHANCED_STYLING.md
# Enhanced Styling

## Overview
This feature refines the CLI output by integrating the Chalk library to provide dynamic, color-coded, and styled log messages. By wrapping all console outputs in the CLI agent with distinct color schemes based on the message type (e.g. help-seeking, replication, self-improvement, planning, and reset messages), the output becomes more user-friendly and informative. This enhancement improves readability and assists developers in quickly identifying the state and intent of the logs.

## Implementation Details

### Source File Update (src/lib/main.js)
- **Import Chalk:**
  - Add `import chalk from 'chalk';` at the top of the file.

- **Wrap Console Logs:**
  - Update `logCLIArgs(args)` to output calls using `chalk.blue` for the JSON string of the arguments.
  - In `logExecutionTime()`, wrap the execution time message with `chalk.gray`.
  - In `handleHelpSeeking()`, log the help-seeking activation message with `chalk.yellow.bold`.
  - In `replicateTasks()`, output each replication task message using `chalk.cyan`.
  - In `handleSelfImprove()`, output diagnostic metrics prefixed with `chalk.magenta` to highlight self-improvement details.
  - In `planTasks()`, use `chalk.green` to log planning mode messages.
  - In `handleDecompose()`, style the goal decomposition headers with `chalk.blueBright`.
  - When persisting the memory log (both to console and file), use `chalk.green` for success confirmation messages.

### Test File Update (tests/unit/main.test.js)
- **Non-functional Changes:**
  - The tests continue to validate that the expected log messages are output. Since the tests use regular expressions to match patterns, update the expected string patterns to account for ANSI escape sequences if necessary, or verify that the output includes the base text (e.g., "Run with:").

### README Update (README.md)
- **Usage Documentation:**
  - Add a note under a new section or in the Features section describing that the CLI now uses enhanced colored output via Chalk to improve readability.
  - Include a sample command output snippet showing colored logs.

### Dependencies File Update (package.json)
- Add the Chalk library to dependencies:
  ```json
  "chalk": "^5.0.0"
  ```

## Testing & Compatibility
- Run `npm test` to verify that the styled outputs are present and that ANSI escape sequences are included in the log outputs.
- Validate that in non-TTY environments (or when the environment variable `FORCE_COLOR=0` is set), Chalk disables styling appropriately.

## Future Considerations
- Consider adding configuration options (via CLI flags or environment variables) to toggle styling on or off.
- Future iterations may support theming options that allow users to customize color schemes further.
features/MERGE_PERSIST.md
# features/MERGE_PERSIST.md
# MERGE_PERSIST

## Overview
The MERGE_PERSIST feature allows the CLI tool to merge the persisted log file (`memory_log.json`) with the current in-memory log. After merging, the persisted log file is cleared. This ensures that log data from previous runs is consolidated into the current session without duplications, while also resetting the external log store for future use.

## Implementation Details

### Source File Update (`src/lib/main.js`):
- **Flag Detection:**
  - Check if the CLI arguments include `--merge-persist`.
- **Merging Process:**
  - If the `--merge-persist` flag is present, read `memory_log.json` (if it exists) to obtain persisted log entries.
  - Merge these entries into the existing `memoryLog` array (ensuring no duplicate entries if already loaded).
  - Delete the `memory_log.json` file to clear persisted data.
  - Output a message indicating that the persisted logs have been successfully merged.

*Example Code Snippet:*
```js
if (args.includes("--merge-persist")) {
  if (fs.existsSync('memory_log.json')) {
    try {
      const data = fs.readFileSync('memory_log.json', { encoding: 'utf8' });
      const persisted = JSON.parse(data);
      if (Array.isArray(persisted)) {
        // Merge persisted entries that are not already present
        memoryLog.push(...persisted);
      }
      fs.unlinkSync('memory_log.json');
      console.log("Persisted log merged and cleared.");
    } catch (err) {
      console.error("Failed to merge persisted log:", err);
    }
  } else {
    console.log("No persisted log to merge.");
  }
}
```

### Test File Update (`tests/unit/main.test.js`):
- Add tests to simulate CLI invocation with the `--merge-persist` flag.
- Create a temporary `memory_log.json` file with known content, invoke the CLI with `--merge-persist`, and check that:
  - The file is deleted afterwards.
  - The in-memory log contains the merged entries from the file.
  - The appropriate success message is logged to the console.

### README Update (`README.md`):
- Update the usage section to document the new `--merge-persist` flag.

*Example Documentation:*
```bash
# To merge persisted logs with your current session and clear the external log file:
node src/lib/main.js --merge-persist
```

## Benefits and Future Considerations
- **Benefits:** Consolidating logs from previous runs helps maintain a complete history in the current session and resets file-based logs to avoid accumulation.
- **Future Considerations:** In the future, consider supporting merging logs from multiple persisted log files or integrating a timestamp-based deduplication mechanism.
features/DIAGNOSTICS.md
# features/DIAGNOSTICS.md
# DIAGNOSTICS

## Overview
This feature adds a diagnostics mode to the CLI tool. When the `--diagnostics` flag is provided, the CLI outputs detailed runtime and environment information. This includes process uptime, memory usage, Node.js version, and a summary of the in-memory log. The diagnostics mode provides users and developers with immediate insights into the health and performance of the CLI agent, facilitating debugging and monitoring.

## Implementation Details

### Source File Update (src/lib/main.js):
- **New Function Implementation:**
  - Add a helper function `handleDiagnostics()` that logs:
    - A header "Diagnostics Report:"
    - Process uptime (using `process.uptime()` formatted to two decimal places).
    - Memory usage details by converting values from `process.memoryUsage()` to megabytes (RSS, Heap Total, Heap Used).
    - Node.js version (from `process.version`).
    - Total number of CLI invocations from the in-memory `memoryLog`.
- **Integration in Main Logic:**
  - In the `main(args)` function, after processing other flags (e.g. `--persist-log`), check if `args` includes `--diagnostics`. If so, call `handleDiagnostics()` to output the diagnostics information.

### Test File Update (tests/unit/main.test.js):
- **New Test Suite for Diagnostics Mode:**
  - Add a new `describe` block for testing the `--diagnostics` flag.
  - Use spies on `console.log` to verify that diagnostics output contains key phrases such as "Diagnostics Report:", "Process uptime:", "Memory usage:" and "Node Version:".
  - Ensure that the diagnostics test does not interfere with other tests by resetting the in-memory log before each test.

### README Update (README.md):
- **Usage Documentation:**
  - Update the README file to document the new `--diagnostics` flag.
  - Provide an example command:
    ```bash
    node src/lib/main.js --diagnostics
    ```
  - Explain that this command outputs runtime diagnostics including uptime, memory usage, Node.js version, and the count of tracked CLI invocations.

## Dependencies File Update (package.json):
- **No Additional Dependencies Required:**
  - The implementation leverages Node.js built-in modules (e.g. `process`) and does not add any external dependencies.

## Testing & Compatibility
- Run `npm test` to verify that the diagnostics test case passes.
- Validate that when the `--diagnostics` flag is used, the CLI outputs the expected diagnostics information.

## Long-Term Considerations
- Future iterations may integrate more detailed performance metrics or extend diagnostics to include network and I/O statistics.
- The diagnostics feature lays the groundwork for enhanced system monitoring and self-improvement by feeding back runtime data into the agent’s decision-making process.features/CONFIG_LOAD.md
# features/CONFIG_LOAD.md
# CONFIG_LOAD

## Overview
This feature enables the CLI tool to load additional configuration from a JSON file when the `--config` flag is provided. With this feature, users can easily customize the tool's behavior (such as logging preferences, enabled flags, or other settings) without modifying the source code directly.

## Implementation Details

### Source File Update (src/lib/main.js):
- Detect if the CLI arguments include the `--config` flag.
- Use Node's `fs` module to synchronously (or asynchronously) read a file named `config.json` from the repository root (or a default location).
- Parse the JSON content and merge its settings with the tool's defaults. For example, if the configuration includes a custom log message or enables/disables a specific mode, override the default behavior.
- Log a confirmation message such as "Configuration loaded successfully.".

### Test File Update (tests/unit/main.test.js):
- Add a unit test that simulates running the CLI with the `--config` flag.
- Mock the file reading functionality (e.g., using `vi.spyOn` or similar) to return a sample configuration JSON.
- Assert that the output includes the configuration load confirmation message.

### README Update (README.md):
- Update the usage instructions to document the new `--config` flag. For example:
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --config
  ```
- Describe that when this flag is used, the CLI will look for a `config.json` file and load additional configuration settings.

## Benefits
- **Flexibility:** Users can adjust settings without changing the code.
- **Maintainability:** Centralizes configuration in a single file, which simplifies future enhancements and customizations.
- **Scalability:** Lays the groundwork for supporting multiple configuration formats in the future (e.g., YAML, TOML).

## Future Considerations
- Extend support to other file formats beyond JSON (e.g., YAML).
- Allow specifying a custom configuration file path (e.g., `--config=path/to/file.json`).
- Validate configuration settings against a schema (using libraries such as Zod) to ensure robustness.features/VERBOSE_OUTPUT.md
# features/VERBOSE_OUTPUT.md
# VERBOSE_OUTPUT

## Overview
This feature enhances the CLI tool by introducing a verbose output mode. When the `--verbose` flag is provided, the tool will display additional contextual information such as a detailed list of processed arguments and environment details. This mode helps during debugging and provides an extra layer of insight into the internal state of the program.

## Implementation Details
- **Source File Update (src/lib/main.js):**
  - Modify the main function to check if `--verbose` is present in the command-line arguments.
  - If `--verbose` is detected, in addition to the regular output, print a detailed message including the raw arguments array and an optional message like "Verbose Mode Active".
  - Maintain the default output behavior when the flag is absent.

- **Test File Update (tests/unit/main.test.js):**
  - Add a test case that simulates running the program with the `--verbose` flag.
  - Capture the console output and assert that it contains both the regular JSON output and the additional verbose details (e.g. presence of the string "Verbose Mode Active").

- **README Update (README.md):**
  - Update the usage instructions to document the new `--verbose` flag. Include an example command, e.g., `node src/lib/main.js --verbose`, and explain that it provides extra information useful for debugging.

- **Dependencies File Update (package.json):**
  - No additional dependencies are required for this feature.

## Testing and Compatibility
- Run `npm test` to ensure the new verbose flag test passes as expected.
- Verify that in absence of the flag, the CLI outputs remain unchanged, ensuring backward compatibility.features/HELP_SEEKING.md
# features/HELP_SEEKING.md
# HELP_SEEKING

## Overview
Help-Seeking is the agent’s ability to recognize when it needs assistance and to actively seek it out. For an autonomous system, this trait is vital to prevent it from getting stuck in a loop or making matters worse when encountering something it doesn’t understand. In the context of our CLI and Lambda library, help-seeking might involve the agent pausing to ask for guidance (from a developer or an external knowledge source) if it hits an unexpected obstacle. This turns the agent from a closed system into a collaborative one – it knows it’s part of a team. By implementing a basic help-seeking behavior, we ensure that the agent can fail gracefully: when it cannot solve a problem with its given tools, it will raise its virtual hand for help rather than silently failing or producing nonsense.

## Implementation Details
- **Error Detection and Flagging:** Augment error handling in `main.js` (particularly in `agenticHandler`). If an operation throws an exception or produces an invalid result that the agent cannot fix, capture that event. Instead of just logging an error or stack trace, have the agent output a clear help request message. For example, in a catch block, do something like: `console.error("HELP NEEDED: The agent could not complete the request due to X. Consider human intervention or additional guidance.")`. This way, whenever the agent is running in automated fashion (like a GitHub Action), anyone monitoring logs will see that the agent is explicitly asking for help on that issue.
- **Interactive Help Command:** Introduce a `--help` or `--assist` CLI flag that doesn’t run the agent’s main logic, but instead prints a guide on using the agent and what to do if the agent itself gets stuck. This is akin to a standard CLI help, but we frame it as the agent explaining how it seeks help. For example, running `node src/lib/main.js --help-agent` could output: “This AI agent will attempt tasks autonomously. If it cannot solve a task, it will output a 'HELP NEEDED' message. In such cases, you may need to intervene or provide more specific instructions.” Including usage of other flags and features in this output is also useful. Essentially, it doubles as both user help and a transparency mechanism about the agent’s limits.
- **Logging for External Triggers:** In scenarios where help is needed, consider creating a structured log or output that external systems could catch. For instance, if running in GitHub Actions, the agent could output a line like `::error ::AGENT_REQUESTED_HELP::details here` (GitHub Actions error logging format), which could trigger notifications. While this is environment-specific, simply documenting that the string "HELP NEEDED" appears when the agent gives up can allow developers to set up alerts or scripts externally. Our implementation just needs to ensure the phrasing is consistent and easy to grep.
- **Test the Fallback:** Write tests to ensure help-seeking triggers correctly. One way is to force an error in `agenticHandler` – perhaps by passing a special command that we intentionally code to throw (for test purposes). Then capture `console.error` or the thrown message in the test to see if it contains the "HELP NEEDED" prompt. Another test can call the new help flag (if implemented as `--assist` or similar) and verify that it prints a usage message and exits without errors. These tests will confirm that the agent not only knows to signal for help but does so in a controlled, testable manner.
- **Documentation Updates:** Update README.md or CONTRIBUTING.md to mention the agent’s help-seeking behavior. Explain that if the agent cannot handle a request, it will output a help-needed message and what that means. Encourage users to look at the logs or console output for those cues. Additionally, document the `--help`/`--assist` flag usage, showing how to get a summary of the agent’s capabilities and limits. This transparency will make it easier for users to trust the agent – they’ll know it won’t silently fail; it will ask for help when out of its depth.

## Long-Term Direction
In the future, the help-seeking trait can become more sophisticated and proactive. Rather than just printing a message, the agent could, for example, open a GitHub issue on its repository describing the problem it faced and labeling it for human review. It could also integrate with Q&A services or documentation: for instance, automatically searching an internal FAQ or even querying an external API (like Stack Overflow or a company knowledge base) when it encounters errors, then trying the advice it finds. As the multi-agent ecosystem grows, an agent could route its question to a specialized “Helper” agent – imagine one agent focused on coding tasks asking another agent that’s hooked up to documentation for pointers. Additionally, with the expansion across repositories, an agent might seek help from agents in other projects that have solved similar problems (a form of inter-agent collaboration). The overarching goal is for the agent to be intelligent enough to know its own limitations and to engage with humans or other resources in a positive, security-conscious way to overcome those limitations. This ensures the system remains robust and continuously improving, without drifting into failure modes silently.
