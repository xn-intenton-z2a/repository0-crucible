# Features

- **List Sources (`--list-sources`)**: Outputs the list of configured public data sources in JSON format. If a `data-sources.json` file is present with a valid array of `{ name, url }`, it will be merged with the default sources. Invalid or missing configs will fall back to defaults with a warning for invalid configs.
- **Help (`--help`, `-h`)**: Display the help message with usage instructions.
- **Diagnostics (`--diagnostics`)**: Outputs diagnostic information (version, node version, platform, architecture, working directory, uptimeSeconds, memoryUsage, and commands) as pretty-printed JSON, including:
  - **publicDataSources**: Array of configured data sources (merged default and custom from data-sources.json).
  - **healthChecks**: Array of objects with real-time availability and latency metrics for each configured data source:
    - `name` (string): Data source name.
    - `url` (string): Data source URL.
    - `statusCode` (number|null): HTTP status code from a HEAD request, or `null` if unreachable.
    - `latencyMs` (number|null): Round-trip time in milliseconds, or `null` if unreachable.
    - `reachable` (boolean): `true` if statusCode is between 200 and 299.
  - **dataFilesCount**: Number of JSON files in the project `data/` directory (or `0` if directory is missing).
  - **dataFiles**: Sorted list of JSON filenames present in `data/` (or an empty array if none).
  - **intermediateFilesCount**: Number of JSON files in the project `intermediate/` directory (or `0` if directory is missing).
  - **intermediateFiles**: Sorted list of JSON filenames present in `intermediate/` (or an empty array if none).
- **Build Intermediate (`--build-intermediate`)**: Reads JSON files from `data/`, transforms each into OWL JSON-LD intermediate artifacts in `intermediate/`, logs each write, and prints a summary line.
- **Add Source (`--add-source <name> <url>`)**: Add a custom data source to the `data-sources.json` configuration, validating inputs and preventing duplicates. Outputs the merged list of sources in JSON.
- **Remove Source (`--remove-source <identifier>`)**: Remove a custom data source by its name or URL from `data-sources.json`. Outputs the updated merged list of sources in JSON.
- **Build Enhanced (`--build-enhanced`)**: Runs the full ontology-building pipeline: refresh sources, build intermediate artifacts, and merge into a single enhanced OWL JSON-LD document.
- **Capital Cities (`--capital-cities`)**: Queries DBpedia for country-capital pairs and outputs an OWL-compatible JSON-LD document with `@context` and `@graph`.
- **SPARQL Query (`--query`, `-q`)**: Execute SPARQL SELECT or ASK queries on JSON-LD OWL artifacts and output results in SPARQL JSON format. Also available via HTTP GET `/query?file=<path>&sparql=<query>`.
