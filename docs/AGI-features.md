# MEMORY

## Overview
Memory is a foundational capability for an agentic system, allowing the agent to retain information from past actions and use it in future decisions. By integrating a memory store, the agent can carry over context between commands within a session (and potentially across sessions), rather than operating in isolation for each input. This enables more complex interactions – later commands can reference or build upon earlier results, and the agent can avoid repeating work or mistakes by recalling what has already been done. In summary, adding persistent memory to the agent will enhance continuity and lay the groundwork for long-term learning and context accumulation.

## Implementation Details
1. **Introduce a Global Memory Store:** In `src/lib/main.js`, define a global memory structure to record processed commands and outcomes. For example, initialize `globalThis.memoryLog = globalThis.memoryLog || []` at the top of the file (similar to how `callCount` is handled) to ensure it persists across invocations in the same runtime. Each entry in `memoryLog` can be an object containing at least the command string and timestamp, and possibly the result of processing.
2. **Record Commands and Results:** Update the `agenticHandler` function to append to `memoryLog` whenever a command is processed.
    - For **single command** inputs (the `'command' in payload` branch), after constructing the `response` object (with `status`, `processedCommand`, etc.), push a copy of this `response` (or a simplified summary) into `memoryLog`.
    - For **batch processing** (`'commands' in payload` branch), append each individual command’s result to `memoryLog` as it’s processed inside the loop. This way, the memory accumulates all commands executed during the agent’s run.
3. **Enable Memory Retrieval:** Add logic to retrieve the stored memory on demand. For instance, if `payload.command` is a specific keyword like `"get_memory"` (case-insensitive), the handler should return the contents of `globalThis.memoryLog` instead of performing a normal command. The return format could be `{ status: "success", memory: [...] }` where the memory array contains the logged entries. Document this special command for users.
4. **Update Unit Tests:** In `tests/unit/main.test.js`, add tests to verify the memory functionality:
    - After processing a single command, calling `agenticHandler({ command: "get_memory" })` should return a result containing that command in the memory list.
    - After a batch of commands, ensure that `memoryLog` length increased accordingly and that a subsequent `"get_memory"` call returns all those commands.
    - Test that memory persists within a single process: e.g. call `agenticHandler` twice with different commands and then check that memory contains both (the test environment resets globals between test cases via `beforeEach`, so multi-call persistence can be checked in one test function).
5. **Documentation:** Update the README to mention the new memory capability. In the **Agentic Library Functions** or **Evolving main.js** section, add a bullet point **Memory Persistence:** describing that the agent now retains a log of all processed commands in-memory during its runtime. Include usage notes, for example: the special `"get_memory"` command can be used to retrieve the log, and note that the memory resets when the process restarts (unless a future persistent storage is introduced).

## Long-Term Direction
This memory feature can evolve significantly over time. In the short term, the memory could be made persistent across runs – for example by saving to a file or database (allowing the agent to remember past sessions or maintain long-term knowledge). The structure of stored memories might become more sophisticated, storing not just raw commands but summarized outcomes or embeddings for efficient lookup. As the agent grows more capable, it could use this memory to inform decisions (avoiding redundant actions, learning from previous errors, etc.). Eventually, the memory module could support **vectorized memory** or semantic search, enabling the agent to retrieve relevant past experiences even as the volume of stored knowledge grows. This trajectory ensures that the agent’s behavior becomes more consistent and “learning-driven” over time, akin to an AGI that accumulates and applies knowledge day by day.

# PLANNING

## Overview
Planning equips the agent with the ability to break down and execute multi-step tasks from a single high-level instruction. Without planning, the agent can only handle one command at a time or a predefined batch of commands supplied by the user. By introducing an automated planning capability, the agent can interpret a complex request (for example, a goal that involves multiple actions or stages) and internally generate a sequence of steps to achieve that goal. This trait increases the agent’s autonomy and usefulness: users can give broad objectives, and the agent will orchestrate the necessary sequence of operations. In essence, the planning feature turns the agentic library from a reactive executor into a proactive problem-solver that can handle compound instructions.

## Implementation Details
1. **Extend Payload Schema for Goals:** Modify `agenticHandler` in `src/lib/main.js` to recognize a high-level goal input. For instance, if the payload contains a property `goal` (a string describing an objective) instead of or in addition to a simple `command`, handle it as a special case before the existing command(s) logic.
2. **Parse Goal into Sub-commands:** Implement a simple planner that splits the goal description into discrete actionable steps. A straightforward approach is to split the `payload.goal` string by a delimiter (such as sentence boundaries or the word "then"). For example, split on `. ` or ` and then ` to produce an array of step strings. Trim and filter out any empty entries. Each resulting step represents a sub-command the agent should perform in sequence.
3. **Execute Planned Steps Sequentially:** Reuse the batch-processing capability to execute these derived sub-commands. There are two possible implementations:
    - **Recursive Call:** Construct a new payload `{ commands: [step1, step2, ...] }` and call `agenticHandler` recursively to leverage the existing batch handling. This way, each step will be validated, logged, and executed as if it were provided directly by the user. Ensure to `await` the recursive call so that planning is completed synchronously, and wrap it in try/catch to handle any errors during sub-step execution.
    - **Inline Loop:** Alternatively, iterate over the `steps` array within the planning branch, processing each step similarly to the batch loop. This is akin to manually performing what the batch handler does: for each step, generate a response (with `status`, `processedCommand`, `timestamp`, etc.), increment `callCount`, and collect the results.
      In either case, the overall result returned by the `agenticHandler` for a goal input should include all sub-step outcomes. For example, return an object `{ status: "success", plan: payload.goal, results: [ ...sub-command results... ] }`.
4. **Add Planning Tests:** In `main.test.js`, introduce tests for the new goal planning behavior:
    - Given a payload with a `goal` string that contains multiple actions (e.g. `"Step1. Then do step2."`), verify that `agenticHandler` returns a success status and a `results` array with an entry for each step. Each sub-result should have its own `processedCommand` matching the parsed steps. Also ensure that `globalThis.callCount` increased by the number of sub-commands, demonstrating that each planned step counted as an invocation.
    - Test edge cases: a goal that is just a single action (should simply execute it like a normal command), or a goal string that might be improperly formatted (the planner should handle gracefully, perhaps treating the whole string as one command if no clear delimiter is found).
5. **Usage Documentation:** Update the README to explain the planning capability. Under **Agentic Library Functions**, add a bullet like **Automated Planning:** describing how the agent can take a `goal` (high-level instruction) and decompose it into multiple steps internally. Provide an example usage, for instance: using the CLI `--agentic` flag with a JSON payload `{"goal": "Do X then do Y"}` will result in the agent performing X and then Y automatically, returning a combined result. Clarify that this happens without the user having to explicitly list `commands` in advance.

## Long-Term Direction
The Planning feature can be improved to be far more sophisticated over time. In the near future, the simplistic splitting logic can be replaced or augmented by an AI model or heuristic that truly understands how to break down goals (for example, using a large language model to interpret a complex instruction and propose a series of sub-tasks). The agent could also incorporate conditional planning – adjusting the plan on the fly if one step’s outcome influences the next (dynamic planning and replanning). In the long term, planning could involve scheduling and optimization, deciding the best order to execute tasks or even doing some in parallel when possible. This trait also opens the door to multi-session planning: the agent might remember a goal that could not be completed in one run and resume later. Overall, robust planning moves the project closer to an AGI-like system that can handle open-ended projects (for example, “set up a new repository and implement feature X, then open a PR”) by autonomously figuring out the intermediate steps.

# GOAL_DECOMPOSITION

## Overview
Goal Decomposition is the agent’s ability to take a broad or complex objective and break it down into a set of smaller, more manageable tasks *without immediately executing them*. This trait is closely related to Planning, but serves a slightly different purpose: instead of carrying out the plan right away, the agent can output or enumerate the sub-goals for review or scheduling. In an agentic workflow, this is useful for transparency and coordination — the agent can present a breakdown of a large task (for example, in a GitHub issue or comment) before actually working on each part. It allows humans or other processes to understand the agent’s intended approach, adjust the plan if needed, or distribute tasks. By explicitly representing a goal as sub-tasks, the system can tackle complex projects in stages and ensure no aspect of the goal is overlooked.

## Implementation Details
1. **Payload Trigger for Decomposition:** Extend `agenticHandler` to handle a request for decomposition distinct from immediate execution. One approach is to use a boolean flag in the payload, e.g., `"decomposeOnly": true` alongside a `goal` string. When `payload.decomposeOnly` is true, the agent should parse the goal into sub-tasks but not execute them.
2. **Decomposition Logic:** Similar to the Planning feature, parse the provided `payload.goal` (or alternatively, use `payload.command` if the user passes the objective in the command field with a flag) into a list of smaller tasks. Use simple heuristic parsing for now (split by sentence or delimiters like “;” or the word “then”). Ensure each sub-task is a concise, actionable statement. For example, `"Set up project and then push to repo"` might split into `["Set up project", "push to repo"]`.
3. **Return Task List Instead of Executing:** Instead of processing each sub-command, immediately return a structured response containing the breakdown. The response could look like `{ status: "success", goal: <original goal>, tasks: ["sub-task 1", "sub-task 2", ...] }`. By providing the tasks in an array, the agent communicates what it would do, without side effects. Do not call the sub-tasks through `agenticHandler` here – simply prepare the list.
4. **Maintain Counters and Logs:** Even though we are not executing the commands, it’s reasonable to treat the decomposition as handling one high-level request. You can increment `globalThis.callCount` by 1 for the decomposition action itself (so that it’s counted as an invocation). Optionally, log an info message indicating that goal decomposition was performed. If the memory feature is enabled, consider storing the goal and its decomposed list in `memoryLog` as a reference for future steps.
5. **Add Tests for Decomposition:** In `main.test.js`, write tests to validate this new mode:
    - When given a payload with `{ goal: "Do A and B", decomposeOnly: true }`, the `agenticHandler` should return a success status with a `tasks` array containing the split tasks (e.g. `["Do A", "Do B"]`). Ensure that none of the tasks were executed (for example, if those tasks would increment `callCount` or produce log entries, they should not appear – only the single decomposition action increments the counter). Check that `globalThis.callCount` increased by exactly 1 in this scenario.
    - Test that an invalid usage (like `decomposeOnly: true` with no `goal` provided) results in an error or rejection, to enforce proper input.
6. **Documentation:** Update README to mention **Goal Decomposition** as a capability. Explain that the agent can output a breakdown of a high-level goal into sub-tasks without executing them. Document how to trigger it, for example: using the `--agentic` flag with a payload like `{"goal": "High-level objective...", "decomposeOnly": true}` will cause the agent to return a list of steps. Emphasize how this differs from normal planning: it’s a way to preview or obtain a task list for a goal, which can then be approved or fed back into the agent for execution.

## Long-Term Direction
Goal decomposition can become far more advanced with iterative improvements. In the future, the agent could employ NLP techniques or learned models to decompose goals more intelligently, even if the instructions are vague or high-level. The sub-tasks could include additional structure, such as estimates of difficulty or prerequisite relationships, effectively creating a plan graph rather than a linear list. This feature also paves the way for multi-agent or multi-worker scenarios: eventually, each sub-goal could be handed off to a separate agent or workflow (perhaps even spun off as separate GitHub issues in an automated way). Additionally, a feedback loop could be introduced — after executing sub-tasks, the agent can verify if the overall goal is met or if further decomposition is needed. In summary, robust goal decomposition will help scale the agent’s abilities to tackle complex projects methodically, and allow oversight or collaboration by presenting its plan before execution.

# SELF_IMPROVEMENT

## Overview
Self-improvement gives the agent an introspective capability: the power to analyze its own performance and make adjustments or suggestions for its evolution. In an agentic system, this means the agent doesn’t just carry out commands blindly; it also monitors metrics like how many times it has run, how long tasks take, and how often errors occur. By having the agent review these aspects, it can identify inefficiencies or recurring problems and either fix them autonomously or flag them for developers. This trait is crucial for a system meant to evolve continuously — it closes the loop where the agent not only *does* tasks but also *learns* from them. Initially, self-improvement will focus on simple quantitative feedback (counters, timings, error tracking). Over time, it can grow into more complex behavior like the agent tuning its strategies or proposing code changes to improve itself.

## Implementation Details
1. **Track Performance Metrics:** Augment the global state and logging to collect data useful for self-assessment. In `src/lib/main.js`, introduce global counters if not already present:
    - `globalThis.errorCount` – initialize to 0, increment whenever the agent encounters a processing error (for example, in the `catch` block of `agenticHandler` or when logging an error for invalid input).
    - `globalThis.totalExecutionTime` – initialize to 0, and add each command’s `executionTimeMS` to this total after processing it. This, combined with the existing `callCount`, can be used to compute average execution time per command.
2. **Extend Status Reporting:** The agent already has a `statusHandler()` that produces a status summary (used by the `--status` CLI flag). Update this status output to include the new metrics:
    - Add an `errorCount` field showing the total number of errors encountered so far in the runtime.
    - Add an `avgExecutionTimeMS` field, calculated as `totalExecutionTime / callCount` (if callCount is 0, this can be 0). This provides a simple efficiency metric.
      Including these in the JSON output of `--status` gives immediate visibility into agent performance and will be useful for the agent itself to reason about its performance.
3. **Self-Check Command:** Introduce a special agentic command for triggering a self-assessment. For example, if `payload.command === "self_improve"` or `"self_review"`, the `agenticHandler` can produce a report or suggestion instead of doing a normal action. In this initial implementation, the self-review could compile the metrics (calls, errors, average time) and maybe a placeholder suggestion. E.g., return an object `{ status: "analysis", callCount, errorCount, avgExecutionTimeMS, suggestion: "No immediate improvements identified." }`. The suggestion string can be basic for now (or based on simple rules, like if `errorCount > 0` suggest improving input validation).
4. **Unit Tests:** Write tests in `main.test.js` to ensure self-improvement features work:
    - After some commands have been processed, call `statusHandler()` (directly or via `agenticLib.main(["--status"])`) and verify that `errorCount` and `avgExecutionTimeMS` appear in the output, and that they have reasonable values (e.g., no errors => errorCount 0, average time is non-negative number). This ensures the metrics are being tracked.
    - Simulate an error scenario (e.g., call `agenticHandler({ command: "" })` inside a test and catch the exception). After that, check that `globalThis.errorCount` incremented by 1.
    - Test the self-review command: e.g., `const analysis = await agenticLib.agenticHandler({ command: "self_improve" });` and expect the returned object to include keys like `callCount` and `errorCount`. If possible, manipulate the environment (call a few commands first, trigger an error) before invoking self_improve and then verify the suggestion reflects the situation (for example, if there were errors, maybe the suggestion notes that).
5. **Documentation:** In the README’s feature list, document **Self-Improvement and Diagnostics:** Explain that the agent now monitors its own performance statistics (number of commands run, errors, timing). Mention that the `--status` output includes these metrics, and describe any special command or mode (like `"self_improve"`) that prints a self-analysis. This lets users know the agent is not a black box — it’s observing itself and will eventually use this data to get better.

## Long-Term Direction
Self-improvement is a pathway to the agent becoming more autonomous and reliable over time. In the future, this could involve the agent proactively using its self-assessment data. For example, if errorCount is growing, the agent might decide to refine its input parsing or call out for help (linking with the help-seeking trait). If certain tasks are slow (high avg execution time), the agent might look for optimizations or algorithm changes. A very ambitious extension is to integrate the OpenAI API or another AI service to critique the agent’s own code or logic: the agent could feed parts of its code (or logs of its decisions) to an LLM and ask for improvement suggestions, then turn those into new feature proposals or automated fixes. In a continuous deployment scenario, the agent might even create pull requests to adjust its own code based on observed inefficiencies. All these steps ensure that as the agent scales to more repositories and complex tasks, it doesn’t just handle more work — it also *evolves* and refines its capabilities, increasingly reducing the need for human intervention in its maintenance.

# REPLICATION

## Overview
Replication endows the agent with the ability to multiply its efforts, either by parallelizing tasks or by propagating itself to new contexts. In practice, this trait means the agent can spawn concurrent processes or handle multiple commands at once, rather than strictly one at a time in sequence. This is important for an AGI-aligned system aiming to work at scale or across projects: as tasks grow or number of repositories increases, a single-threaded agent would become a bottleneck. With replication, the agent can tackle different subtasks simultaneously (like an organism growing new cells to handle more function), and even create copies of its logic to deploy into other repositories or environments. Initially, we focus on parallel execution of command batches as a form of “soft” replication. This will improve throughput and test the waters for true multi-agent operation.

## Implementation Details
1. **Parallel Batch Execution:** Modify the batch processing behavior in `agenticHandler` to support parallel command execution when requested. Introduce a flag in the payload, for example `payload.parallel === true`, to indicate that if a list of `commands` is provided, they can be processed concurrently. By default, the existing behavior is sequential to preserve order, so this flag must be explicitly set by the user or calling context.
2. **Implement Concurrency with Promises:** In the `'commands' in payload` branch of `agenticHandler`, add a condition for parallel execution. If `payload.parallel` is true:
    - Instead of using a `for...of` loop to iterate through commands one by one, use `Promise.all` to initiate all command operations at once. For each command string in the array, call a helper function or the core processing logic to produce a result promise. (This core logic can be the same code that the sequential loop uses – consider refactoring the single-command processing into a small function that can be called for each element).
    - Await the `Promise.all` to get an array of results. Ensure that `globalThis.callCount` is incremented appropriately for each command (if the helper function increments it, this will naturally happen; otherwise, you may need to increment in a thread-safe manner, but since JavaScript is single-threaded per event loop, increments in each promise callback are fine).
    - Return the aggregated result object with all individual results, same as in sequential mode. The order of results in the array should correspond to the order of input commands. (Note: `Promise.all` will preserve order of the results matching the input array indices, even though execution is concurrent, so the user sees a predictable order in the output.)
3. **Ensure Backward Compatibility:** If `payload.parallel` is not set or false, retain the current sequential processing. This is important because some tasks might depend on order or have side effects that can’t safely run in parallel. By requiring an explicit flag, we ensure existing usage remains deterministic.
4. **Testing Parallel Behavior:** Write tests to validate the replication/parallel feature:
    - For a given payload with multiple commands and `parallel: true`, ensure that the `agenticHandler` returns the correct number of results and that each result is a success for the respective command. Verify that `globalThis.callCount` increased by the number of commands. (It’s hard to unit test actual concurrency timing without introducing artificial delays, but we can at least ensure it doesn’t crash and produces the same outcome as sequential in terms of data).
    - As a basic concurrency test, you might simulate a scenario where one command would take longer than another by using a mock or spy. For example, spy on `logInfo` and insert a small delay in one of the command processes. Then call the parallel handler and confirm that all results come back. This is more of an integration test; as a unit test, we can assume Node’s promise handling works and just focus on outcome correctness.
    - Also test that without the flag, the behavior remains sequential (for completeness, though the existing tests already cover sequential batch).
5. **Document Usage:** In the README, add a note about **Parallel Command Execution:** Explain that the agent supports running batch commands in parallel to increase speed. Show an example JSON payload: `{"commands": ["task1", "task2", "task3"], "parallel": true}`. Caution the user that tasks should be independent when using this mode, since parallel execution means they won’t wait for each other’s completion. Mention that this parallelism is an initial form of agent “replication” – the agent effectively creates concurrent workers for each task internally.

## Long-Term Direction
Replication as parallel execution is just the first step. In the future, this capability could evolve into the agent spawning fully independent sub-agents or threads that not only run concurrently but possibly on different machines or for different repositories. For instance, the agent could duplicate its core logic and deploy it to another repository to assist with that project (a form of self-propagation across repositories). It might also manage a pool of worker agents, assigning tasks to each (achieving load balancing and higher availability). With cloud infrastructure (like AWS Lambda, which this project already targets), one can imagine the agent spinning up multiple Lambda instances to handle a flood of tasks simultaneously – the foundation laid by the parallel flag would scale up to that scenario. In the long term, robust replication means the system can handle large-scale automation: dozens of tasks across multiple projects might be handled at once by a swarm of agent instances that share a common memory or mission. We will need to also introduce coordination mechanisms (to avoid duplicated effort or conflicting actions), which combined with replication leads to the concept of a **multi-agent orchestra** working in harmony on overarching goals.

# HELP_SEEKING

## Overview
Help-seeking is the trait that enables the agent to recognize its own limitations and reach out for external assistance. For an autonomous agent, “help” can come in various forms: consulting a more knowledgeable AI (like calling an OpenAI API for guidance), searching documentation or knowledge bases, or even alerting a human operator for input. This capability is crucial for keeping the agent aligned and effective – rather than getting stuck or making faulty assumptions, the agent can proactively seek information or confirmation. In our context, implementing help-seeking means the agent can handle queries it doesn’t internally know how to solve by leveraging an external AI model to get answers, and it can escalate issues when automated methods fail. This ensures that as complexity grows, the agent remains robust, using external knowledge to supplement its own logic.

## Implementation Details
1. **Identify When to Seek Help:** Determine the conditions under which the agent should invoke an external helper. Initially, we can trigger help-seeking via a special command pattern. For example, if `payload.command` begins with `"help:"` or `"ask:"`, the agent will treat everything after that prefix as a query for external assistance. This provides an explicit way for users (or higher-level agent logic) to request the agent to fetch an answer or solution it doesn’t have built-in.
2. **Integrate OpenAI API (External AI):** Leverage the existing OpenAI dependency to answer the query. In `src/lib/main.js`, within the agenticHandler, handle the help query by calling the OpenAI API:
    - Use the OpenAI SDK (`OpenAIApi`) to create a completion or chat completion. For example, if using a chat model, construct a prompt with the user’s question. A simple approach is: system message like “You are an expert assistant.” and user message with the query string extracted from `payload.command`.
    - Call `await openai.createChatCompletion({ model: "gpt-3.5-turbo", messages: [...] })` (or a comparable completion method) using the API key from config. Parse the response to extract the assistant’s answer text.
    - Note: In tests and development, ensure this call is mocked or not executed against real API unless configured. The test suite already sets up a mock for `openai` which returns a dummy response. Our code should handle that dummy format (which appears to return a JSON string in `choices[0].message.content`). If the content looks like JSON, parse it; otherwise, treat it as plain text.
3. **Return the Acquired Help:** Format the agent’s response to include the help information. For example, return an object `{ status: "success", answer: <string> }` where `<string>` is the answer from the external source. The agent effectively becomes a relay for information in this scenario. Also increment `callCount` for this as it is a handled command. If the external API fails or returns nothing useful, handle errors gracefully: log an error and maybe return a message like “Unable to get help at this time.”
4. **Error Escalation (Future hook):** In addition to explicit help commands, consider modifying error handling to utilize help-seeking. For instance, if after implementing other features the agent encounters a command it truly cannot process or an error it doesn’t know how to fix, it could automatically attempt a help query (perhaps asking, “How do I handle X error?”). Implementing this fully may be complex, so for now just include a placeholder or note in logs that suggests using help. (This can be mentioned as a comment or simple conditional: in the catch of `agenticHandler`, after logging the error, you might output `logInfo("Consider using help-seeking for: " + error.message)` as a hint.)
5. **Unit Tests for Help Query:** Add tests to verify the help-seeking behavior:
    - When `agenticHandler` is called with a command like `"help: What is 2+2?"`, the function should invoke the OpenAI API. Thanks to the test’s mock, it will receive a dummy response. Verify that the returned object contains an `answer` field (or similarly named field) with the expected content from the dummy (e.g., `"dummy success"` from the mock). For instance:
      ```js
      const resp = await agenticLib.agenticHandler({ command: "help: test question" });
      expect(resp.status).toBe("success");
      expect(resp.answer).toMatch(/dummy success/);
      ```
    - Test that normal commands (not starting with "help:") do not inadvertently call the API. This can be done by spying on the OpenAI client method: for a regular payload, ensure the spy is not called, whereas for a help payload it is called.
    - If implementing any error escalation, simulate a scenario that triggers it and verify the agent attempts a help call or logs the suggestion.
6. **Documentation:** Update the README to include a **Help-Seeking** feature description. Explain that the agent can tap into external knowledge when asked. Provide usage examples, such as: `{"command": "help: <question>"}` will cause the agent to query an AI model for an answer to `<question>`. Also mention the intended purpose: the agent uses this to overcome its built-in limitations. If applicable, note that in future the agent might automatically use this ability when it encounters an unfamiliar task or persistent error.

## Long-Term Direction
The help-seeking capability can expand into a robust safety net and research tool for the agent. In the future, the agent could have multiple channels for help: querying documentation or forums (via APIs), asking other specialized agents, or creating a GitHub issue to get human feedback on a problem. It could incorporate a feedback mechanism where if a solution from the AI assistant doesn’t work, it tries a different query or source. Help-seeking also ties in with self-improvement: the agent might ask for code review or best practices from an AI when improving itself. As it becomes more advanced, the agent could maintain a knowledge base of solutions – so after seeking help once, it remembers the answer for next time (integrating with the Memory trait). Ultimately, a well-developed help-seeking trait ensures that even as the agent tackles new domains or unexpected challenges, it remains adaptable and does not operate in a vacuum. It will continuously learn from external wisdom and involve humans only when absolutely necessary, striking a balance between autonomy and safe oversight.

# Mission Statement

**Agentic-lib** is evolving into an intelligent automation system endowed with multiple AGI-aligned capabilities, all oriented toward a coherent long-term purpose: enabling agentic, cross-repository intelligent automation. The ultimate vision is a network of self-managing coding agents that can understand high-level goals, break them down, execute tasks across many projects, learn from their experiences, and seek assistance when needed – all with minimal human intervention. Each of the new features (Memory, Planning, Goal Decomposition, Self-Improvement, Replication, and Help-Seeking) contributes to this vision in a concrete, feasible way, building the stepping stones toward a truly autonomous development workflow.

In the near term, these traits function as enhancements to the JavaScript CLI/Lambda agent that drives **agentic-lib**:
- **Memory** provides continuity. The agent now retains a log of actions and outcomes, which means it can carry context from one step to the next. This is immediately useful for avoiding redundant operations and will later allow experience-based learning. For example, when the agent works on Repository A and then on Repository B, a memory of patterns or solutions from A could inform its actions on B.
- **Planning** gives the agent foresight. Instead of reacting to one command at a time, it can map out a sequence of tasks to achieve a bigger objective. Right now it executes those plans instantly, but this capability will expand to planning over longer durations (even across workflow runs) and coordinating complex changes (like a multi-step refactor that touches many parts of a codebase or multiple repositories).
- **Goal Decomposition** adds transparency and manageability to complex objectives. The agent can articulate a game plan (a set of sub-tasks) for a broad goal, which can be reviewed or assigned out. In a multi-repository scenario, the agent might decompose a company-wide objective into repo-specific tasks. This structured breakdown makes large-scale automation safer and more organized, since each piece can be tracked (potentially as separate issues or pull requests).
- **Self-Improvement** makes the agent reflective. By tracking its performance (how many errors, how fast it completes tasks) the agent lays the groundwork for optimizing itself. In the short run, this means better observability and diagnostics in the system. In the long run, the agent could use this information to autonomously fine-tune its own algorithms – for instance, detecting that it often fails a certain kind of task and adjusting its approach or updating its code. This trait keeps the agent aligned with best practices and efficiency as it scales up.
- **Replication** unlocks scale. The agent is no longer a singleton processing one item at a time – it can replicate its effort either through parallel processing or by spawning new agent instances. Immediately, this manifests as parallel command execution which speeds up workflows (e.g., running multiple checks or updates simultaneously). Looking forward, replication means the agentic-lib model can be instantiated in multiple environments at once: think of dozens of agent clones each working on a different repository but sharing the same core knowledge. This horizontal scaling is essential for cross-repository automation in large organizations.
- **Help-Seeking** keeps the agent humble and effective. When the agent encounters something it doesn’t know, it can ask an external AI or resource, rather than stalling or guessing wrongly. Currently, this is achieved via OpenAI API calls for answers. As this feature matures, the agent will integrate more sources (documentation, human feedback) and become increasingly adept at knowing when and how to seek help. This ensures that as the agent’s autonomy grows, it remains grounded and correct in its actions, leveraging the broader world’s knowledge.

All these capabilities align to serve a **unified mission**: an autonomous system that can handle the lifecycle of software development tasks across multiple projects. Concretely, we are moving toward a scenario where you could give the agent a high-level directive (for example, “ensure all our repositories are using the latest version of library X and adhere to security policy Y”), and the agent would:
1. **Understand and Plan:** It would use Goal Decomposition and Planning to figure out what needs to be done for each repository – maybe creating a checklist per repository.
2. **Take Action in Parallel:** Using Replication, it would initiate changes in multiple repositories at once (branching, editing files, running tests), using memory to avoid repeating known fixes and using its plan as a guide.
3. **Learn and Adapt:** Throughout, Self-Improvement metrics would monitor which repos encountered issues (maybe some tests failed or some had edge cases). The agent could adjust its approach repository by repository – for instance, if it learned a better fix in one place, Memory would carry that knowledge to the others.
4. **Seek Guidance if Stuck:** If a particular repository has an unusual setup that the agent doesn’t understand, the Help-Seeking trait would kick in – the agent might query documentation or even open a “help needed” issue for a human maintainer, ensuring that it doesn’t silently fail.
5. **Deliver Results:** Finally, the agent would open pull requests or issues summarizing changes for each repository (or automatically merge them if permitted), effectively executing a coordinated cross-repo update with minimal human oversight.

The long-term purpose is ambitious but grounded in these tangible capabilities. Each new feature is a **plausible next step**: for example, after implementing basic memory, the next step is to make that memory persistent or sharable among agent instances (so that one agent’s learnings become every agent’s knowledge). After introducing planning and decomposition, the next step is to integrate those with the GitHub issue workflow – the agent could start creating and managing issues on its own to track sub-tasks. Self-improvement opens the door to techniques like on-the-fly model prompting (the agent asking “how can I do this better?” and applying the advice). Replication will eventually entail deploying the agent as a service or container that can be instantiated on demand for whatever project needs it. And help-seeking will evolve into a rich web of integrations with documentation, Q&A forums, and direct human loop-ins when necessary.

In summary, the trajectory defined in this feature set steers **agentic-lib** toward becoming a general-purpose automation AI for software projects. It’s not science fiction – each step is achievable with incremental improvements and integrations, and together they compound into a system that can handle increasing complexity. By focusing on feasible enhancements now (like logging memory, adding parallelism, using an API for help, etc.), we ensure that future leaps (like autonomous multi-repo refactoring or self-directed learning) are built on solid ground. All traits work in concert: memory and help-seeking ensure it has the knowledge, planning and decomposition give it strategy, replication gives it manpower, and self-improvement ensures it keeps getting better. With these aligned, **agentic-lib** can truly fulfill its mission of agentic, cross-repository intelligent automation – a stepping stone toward the broader vision of self-evolving code.
