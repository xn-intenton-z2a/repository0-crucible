# `repository0`

The repository is intended as a template that includes:
* A Template Base: A starting point for new projects.
* A Running Experiment: An example implementation demonstrating core CLI functionality with integrated automated workflows.
* Workflows from `agentic‑lib` which reference reusable GitHub workflows for testing, building, and deployment.

## Overview
`repository0` is a demo repository showcasing GitHub workflows imported from intentïon `agentic‑lib`. Its primary purpose is to demonstrate automated CI/CD workflows alongside a minimal CLI that performs arithmetic operations, including a newly added exponentiation feature.

## What’s Inside

- **GitHub Workflows:**
  Automated workflows in the `.github/workflows/` directory utilize reusable components from intentïon `agentic‑lib` for tasks including testing, linting, formatting, and deployment.

- **Source Code:**
  The main functionality is implemented in `src/lib/main.js`, which demonstrates robust CLI interactivity, error handling, and arithmetic operations.

- **Dependencies:**
  The `package.json` file lists all necessary production and development dependencies, along with scripts for testing, building, formatting, and updating.

- **Tests:**
  Unit tests in the `tests/unit/` folder ensure the CLI behaves as expected, with near complete coverage of all scenarios.

- **Documentation:**
  This `README.md` provides current usage information and outlines how to contribute, as described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Getting Started

This repository is pre-configured with workflows and scripts. Before running, ensure you set the following secret:
- `CHATGPT_API_SECRET_KEY` – Required for access to the OpenAI API for model `o3-mini`. Configure it in *Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions*.

## intentïon `agentic‑lib`

The **intentïon `agentic‑lib`** is a collection of reusable GitHub Actions workflows that enable your repository to operate autonomously. These workflows are designed to continuously test, build, update, and evolve the code through automated processes.

*Warning:* Running these workflows might incur charges on your OpenAI account and consume GitHub Actions minutes.

*Warning:* Experimental. This system is under active development and may evolve over time.
