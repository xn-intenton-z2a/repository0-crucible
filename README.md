# owl-builder

`owl-builder` is a CLI tool and JavaScript library for building, managing, and querying OWL ontologies. It offers a suite of functions to build an ontology from public data sources, integrate supplemental theme ontologies, run diagnostics, and even serve a web interface for interactive querying and visualization.

## Change Log
- Updated README to align with CONTRIBUTING guidelines.
- Refreshed documentation and examples to accurately reflect owl-builder's mission of ontology management.
- Standardized help message and CLI output across commands.
- Improved test coverage in the unit tests.

## Repository Template

This repository serves as a template to:

* Kickstart new projects with ontology management capabilities.
* Demonstrate best practices for CLI and web interface based applications.
* Provide an example implementation using automated CI/CD workflows from [agenticâ€‘lib](https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib).

See [TEMPLATE-README.md](./TEMPLATE-README.md) for additional details.
