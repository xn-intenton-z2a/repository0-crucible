# repository0-crucible

`repository0-crucible` is a demo repository that showcases the GitHub workflows imported from intentïon [agentic‑lib](https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib). Its primary purpose is to demonstrate these automated CI/CD workflows and serve as a base for ontology-based JavaScript libraries.

## Change Log
- Enhanced main.js with additional library functions: buildOntology, serveWebInterface, and displayHelp to reflect the mission of automated ontology building and management as outlined in CONTRIBUTING.md.
- Updated help message formatting in main.js to remove an extraneous closing bracket, ensuring consistency with test expectations.

## Repository Template

The repository is intended as a template that includes:
* A Template Base: A starting point for new projects.
* A Running Experiment: An example implementation that demonstrates one way to use the template.
* Example GitHub Workflows from [agentic‑lib](https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib) which hand off to reusable workflows.

See [TEMPLATE-README.md](./TEMPLATE-README.md) for more details.
