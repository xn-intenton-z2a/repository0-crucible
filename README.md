# repository0-crucible

`repository0-crucible` is a demo repository that showcases the GitHub workflows imported from intentïon [agentic‑lib](https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib). Its primary purpose is to demonstrate these automated CI/CD workflows.

To create a self-evolving agentic coding system of your own based on this one see the [TEMPLATE-README.md](./TEMPLATE-README.md) for more details.

This readme shall evolve into a JavaScript library based on of the seed CONTRIBUTING files in [./seeds](./seeds).

## Repository Template

The repository is intended as a template that includes:
* A Template Base: A starting point for new projects.
* A Running Experiment: An example implementation that demonstrates one way to use the template.
* Example GitHub Workflows from [agentic‑lib](https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib) which hand off to reusable workflows.

* See [TEMPLATE-README.md](./TEMPLATE-README.md) for more details.

## Installation

Install via npm:

```bash
npm install repository0-crucible
```

## Features

TODO: Add features here.

## Usage

To run the CLI tool and see help instructions:

```bash
node src/lib/main.js --help
```

To output an example OWL ontology in JSON format representing capital cities with a generation timestamp, run:

```bash
node src/lib/main.js --capital-cities
```

To output diagnostics information about the current environment including Node.js version, OS platform, and available commands, run:

```bash
node src/lib/main.js --diagnostics
```

To simulate crawling public data sources and output dynamic JSON data, run:

```bash
node src/lib/main.js --crawl-data
```

To refresh the data (simulate a data refresh operation), run:

```bash
node src/lib/main.js --refresh
```

The expected output is a JSON object that includes a message confirming the refresh and a refreshedAt property with the current ISO timestamp.

To start a simple HTTP server that serves the OWL ontology for capital cities, run:

```bash
node src/lib/main.js --serve
```

Once the server is running, send an HTTP GET request to:

http://localhost:3000/capital-cities

to retrieve the capital cities ontology in JSON format.

### Example Commands

- **Default Demo Output:**
  ```bash
  npm run start
  ```

- **Help Message:**
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --help
  ```

- **Capital Cities Example (includes generatedAt timestamp):**
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --capital-cities
  ```

- **Diagnostics Example (shows environment and command listing):**
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --diagnostics
  ```

- **Crawl Data Simulation (outputs simulated crawl data with fetchedAt timestamp):**
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --crawl-data
  ```

- **Refresh Data Simulation (outputs a refresh confirmation with refreshedAt timestamp):**
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --refresh
  ```

- **Serve Capital Cities Server:**
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --serve
  ```
  This starts a simple HTTP server on port 3000. Send a GET request to http://localhost:3000/capital-cities to receive the OWL ontology JSON for capital cities.
