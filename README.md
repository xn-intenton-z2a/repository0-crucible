# repository0-crucible

`repository0-crucible` is a demo repository that showcases the GitHub workflows imported from intentïon [agentic‑lib](https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib). Its primary purpose is to demonstrate these automated CI/CD workflows.

To create a self-evolving agentic coding system of your own based on this one see the [TEMPLATE-README.md](./TEMPLATE-README.md) for more details.

This readme shall evolve into a JavaScript library based on of the seed CONTRIBUTING files in [./seeds](./seeds).

## Repository Template

The repository is intended as a template that includes:
* A Template Base: A starting point for new projects.
* A Running Experiment: An example implementation that demonstrates one way to use the template.
* Example GitHub Workflows from [agentic‑lib](https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib) which hand off to reusable workflows.

* See [TEMPLATE-README.md](./TEMPLATE-README.md) for more details.
