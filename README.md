# repository0-crucible

`repository0-crucible` is a demo repository that showcases the GitHub workflows imported from intentïon [agentic‑lib](https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib). Its primary purpose is to demonstrate these automated CI/CD workflows.

To create a self-evolving agentic coding system of your own based on this one see the [TEMPLATE-README.md](./TEMPLATE-README.md) for more details.

This readme shall evolve into a JavaScript library based on the seed CONTRIBUTING files in [./seeds](./seeds).

## Repository Template

The repository is intended as a template that includes:
* A Template Base: A starting point for new projects.
* A Running Experiment: An example implementation that demonstrates one way to use the template.
* Example GitHub Workflows from [agentic‑lib](https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib) which hand off to reusable workflows.

* See [TEMPLATE-README.md](./TEMPLATE-README.md) for more details.

## Installation

Install via npm:

```bash
npm install repository0-crucible
```

## Features

* Automated conversion of CLI arguments: Numeric strings like "42" or "3.14" are automatically converted to numbers, boolean strings like "true" or "false" are converted to booleans, while non-numeric strings remain unchanged.
* Special handling of the string "NaN" is implemented to preserve it as a string in order to serve as a special-case marker.
* Demonstration of GitHub workflows for CI/CD setups.
* Template based structure ideal for evolving JavaScript libraries.

## Usage

To run the CLI tool and see help instructions:

```bash
node src/lib/main.js --help
