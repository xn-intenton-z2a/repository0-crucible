# repository0-crucible

`repository0-crucible` is a demo repository that showcases the GitHub workflows imported from intentïon [agentic‑lib](https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib). Its primary purpose is to demonstrate these automated CI/CD workflows.

To create a self-evolving agentic coding system of your own based on this one see the [TEMPLATE-README.md](./TEMPLATE-README.md) for more details.

This readme shall evolve into a JavaScript library based on the seed CONTRIBUTING files in [./seeds](./seeds).

## Repository Template

The repository is intended as a template that includes:
* A Template Base: A starting point for new projects.
* A Running Experiment: An example implementation that demonstrates one way to use the template.
* Example GitHub Workflows from [agentic‑lib](https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib) which hand off to reusable workflows.

* See [TEMPLATE-README.md](./TEMPLATE-README.md) for more details.

## Installation

Install via npm:

```bash
npm install repository0-crucible
```

## Features

- CLI tool for building and managing OWL ontologies.
- JSON-based persistence and retrieval of OWL ontologies via a dedicated persistence module (located in src/lib/persistence.js).

## Usage

To run the CLI tool and see help instructions:

```bash
node src/lib/main.js --help
```

### Example Commands

- **Default Demo Output:**
  ```bash
  npm run start
  ```

- **Read Ontology from JSON File:**
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --read path/to/ontology.json
  ```

- **Persist Ontology to JSON File:**
  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --persist path/to/output.json
  ```

The --read command will load and display the ontology from the specified JSON file, while the --persist command will write a sample ontology object (or your provided ontology) to the specified JSON file.

For direct use of the persistence functionality in your code, import the module from:

```javascript
import { readOntology, persistOntology } from './src/lib/persistence.js';
```
