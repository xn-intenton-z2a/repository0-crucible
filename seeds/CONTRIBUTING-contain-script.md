# contain-script

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **contain-script**—a cutting‑edge JavaScript library and CLI utility that simplifies the execution and management of containerized scripts on your local machine. Built with Node 20 and ECMAScript Modules, contain-script provides an intuitive interface for running isolated tasks in containers, ideal for development, testing, and automation on modern systems.

## Mission Statement

contain-script aims to abstract the complexities of container management. By offering a high‑level interface for containerized script execution, we help developers run isolated environments without manual container orchestration, efficiently utilizing local resources (e.g., machines with 16GB memory or more).

## How to Contribute

1. **Report Issues:**  
   If you discover a bug or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue on GitHub with detailed steps to reproduce.

2. **Submit Pull Requests:**

## Issue House Choice Options

repository specific activities:
- Create, vary or extend as many library functions as you can that deliver the spirit of this CONTRIBUTING.md Update the Change Log in README.md (or say what was checked).

generic activities:
- Review the Mission Statement and prune any "drift" from the source file where there are no longer relevant features. Update the Change Log in README.md (or say what was checked).
- Review the Mission Statement and create, vary or extend as many features as you can inline with the Mission Statement. Update the Change Log in README.md (or say what was checked).
  #- Find anything that might be a "simulated" or "demo" implementation and switch to a real implementation. Update the Change Log in README.md (or say what was checked).
  #- Consider alternate code paths that could be explicitly handled to improve the range of supported behaviours. Update the Change Log in README.md (or say what was checked).
  #- Look for code that could be simplified using a library and introduce that library. Update the Change Log in README.md (or say what was checked).

undocumented chores:
#- Look for any duplicated code that could be usefully abstracted out to become shared code and implement that abstraction.
- Refresh the README, consulting the guidance in CONTRIBUTING.md while retaining any relevant content and pruning irrelevant content.
  #- Dry-run any examples in comments or the README against the current code and if they are not accurate or if they could cover more features, update the docs or code to be accurate.
- Bring test coverage up as close to 100% as possible, have single layer mocked tests and deeper tests mocking at the external resource (e.g. file system or network).
  #- Ensure the main function so that it generates some demo output without an over the wire call, and hint a CLI switch that will do the real call.
