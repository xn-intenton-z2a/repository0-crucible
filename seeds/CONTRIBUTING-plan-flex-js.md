# plan-flex-js

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **plan-flex-js**—an innovative JavaScript library and CLI utility for solving complex non‑linear planning problems in dynamic and uncertain environments. plan-flex-js leverages advanced planning techniques, including a target stack approach that combines forward and backward state-space planning, to generate adaptive plans that consider resource constraints, temporal ordering, and incomplete knowledge.

## Mission Statement

plan-flex-js is designed to bridge the gap between cutting‑edge planning research and practical applications in scheduling, robotics, logistics, and beyond. Built with Node 20 and ECMAScript Modules, our framework provides a modular, testable, and extensible solution for developers seeking to implement flexible planning systems capable of handling dynamic real-world challenges.

## How to Contribute

1. **Report Issues & Suggest Enhancements:**  
   Open a GitHub issue if you encounter bugs or have ideas for new features. Please include clear reproduction steps, logs, and examples to help us understand the problem.

2. **Submit Pull Requests:**
   - **Fork & Branch:** Fork the repository and create a dedicated branch for your feature or bugfix.
   - **Coding Standards:** Write clean, modular, and well-documented code that adheres to modern JavaScript practices (Node 20, ESM).
   - **Testing:** Add unit and integration tests to cover your changes, ensuring that both the CLI and core planning algorithms work as expected.
   - **Documentation:** Update this file and other relevant documentation if your changes impact the planning algorithms or CLI behavior.
   - **Pull Request:** Submit your pull request and actively participate in the code review process.

3. **Enhance Documentation:**  
   Help us improve our guides, API references, and examples to make plan-flex-js accessible to both developers and researchers working on non‑linear planning challenges.

4. **Innovate in Planning Algorithms:**  
   We welcome contributions that explore new planning heuristics, optimize existing algorithms, or extend the framework to handle more complex and dynamic scenarios.

## Guidelines

- **Code Quality:**  
  Write modern, maintainable JavaScript using Node 20 and ESM. Your contributions should be modular, easy to understand, and thoroughly documented.

- **Testing:**  
  Comprehensive testing is essential. Please include tests that cover CLI functionality and core algorithm performance under various planning scenarios.

- **Commit Messages:**  
  Use clear and descriptive commit messages that explain the purpose and impact of your changes.

- **Collaboration:**  
  Engage constructively in GitHub issues and pull request reviews. Your feedback and collaboration are crucial to refining plan-flex-js.

## Issue House Choice Options

repository specific activities:
- Create, vary or extend as many library functions as you can that deliver the spirit of this CONTRIBUTING.md Update the Change Log in README.md (or say what was checked).

generic activities:
- Review the Mission Statement and prune any "drift" from the source file where there are no longer relevant features. Update the Change Log in README.md (or say what was checked).
- Review the Mission Statement and create, vary or extend as many features as you can inline with the Mission Statement. Update the Change Log in README.md (or say what was checked).
  #- Find anything that might be a "simulated" or "demo" implementation and switch to a real implementation. Update the Change Log in README.md (or say what was checked).
  #- Consider alternate code paths that could be explicitly handled to improve the range of supported behaviours. Update the Change Log in README.md (or say what was checked).
  #- Look for code that could be simplified using a library and introduce that library. Update the Change Log in README.md (or say what was checked).

undocumented chores:
#- Look for any duplicated code that could be usefully abstracted out to become shared code and implement that abstraction.
- Refresh the README, consulting the guidance in CONTRIBUTING.md while retaining any relevant content and pruning irrelevant content.
  #- Dry-run any examples in comments or the README against the current code and if they are not accurate or if they could cover more features, update the docs or code to be accurate.
- Bring test coverage up as close to 100% as possible, have single layer mocked tests and deeper tests mocking at the external resource (e.g. file system or network).
  #- Ensure the main function so that it generates some demo output without an over the wire call, and hint a CLI switch that will do the real call.
