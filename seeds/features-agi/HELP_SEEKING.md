# HELP_SEEKING

## Overview
Help-Seeking is the agent’s ability to recognize when it needs assistance and to actively seek it out. For an autonomous system, this trait is vital to prevent it from getting stuck in a loop or making matters worse when encountering something it doesn’t understand. In the context of our CLI and Lambda library, help-seeking might involve the agent pausing to ask for guidance (from a developer or an external knowledge source) if it hits an unexpected obstacle. This turns the agent from a closed system into a collaborative one – it knows it’s part of a team. By implementing a basic help-seeking behavior, we ensure that the agent can fail gracefully: when it cannot solve a problem with its given tools, it will raise its virtual hand for help rather than silently failing or producing nonsense.

## Implementation Details
- **Error Detection and Flagging:** Augment error handling in `main.js` (particularly in `agenticHandler`). If an operation throws an exception or produces an invalid result that the agent cannot fix, capture that event. Instead of just logging an error or stack trace, have the agent output a clear help request message. For example, in a catch block, do something like: `console.error("HELP NEEDED: The agent could not complete the request due to X. Consider human intervention or additional guidance.")`. This way, whenever the agent is running in automated fashion (like a GitHub Action), anyone monitoring logs will see that the agent is explicitly asking for help on that issue.
- **Interactive Help Command:** Introduce a `--help` or `--assist` CLI flag that doesn’t run the agent’s main logic, but instead prints a guide on using the agent and what to do if the agent itself gets stuck. This is akin to a standard CLI help, but we frame it as the agent explaining how it seeks help. For example, running `node src/lib/main.js --help-agent` could output: “This AI agent will attempt tasks autonomously. If it cannot solve a task, it will output a 'HELP NEEDED' message. In such cases, you may need to intervene or provide more specific instructions.” Including usage of other flags and features in this output is also useful. Essentially, it doubles as both user help and a transparency mechanism about the agent’s limits.
- **Logging for External Triggers:** In scenarios where help is needed, consider creating a structured log or output that external systems could catch. For instance, if running in GitHub Actions, the agent could output a line like `::error ::AGENT_REQUESTED_HELP::details here` (GitHub Actions error logging format), which could trigger notifications. While this is environment-specific, simply documenting that the string "HELP NEEDED" appears when the agent gives up can allow developers to set up alerts or scripts externally. Our implementation just needs to ensure the phrasing is consistent and easy to grep.
- **Test the Fallback:** Write tests to ensure help-seeking triggers correctly. One way is to force an error in `agenticHandler` – perhaps by passing a special command that we intentionally code to throw (for test purposes). Then capture `console.error` or the thrown message in the test to see if it contains the "HELP NEEDED" prompt. Another test can call the new help flag (if implemented as `--assist` or similar) and verify that it prints a usage message and exits without errors. These tests will confirm that the agent not only knows to signal for help but does so in a controlled, testable manner.
- **Documentation Updates:** Update README.md or CONTRIBUTING.md to mention the agent’s help-seeking behavior. Explain that if the agent cannot handle a request, it will output a help-needed message and what that means. Encourage users to look at the logs or console output for those cues. Additionally, document the `--help`/`--assist` flag usage, showing how to get a summary of the agent’s capabilities and limits. This transparency will make it easier for users to trust the agent – they’ll know it won’t silently fail; it will ask for help when out of its depth.

## Long-Term Direction
In the future, the help-seeking trait can become more sophisticated and proactive. Rather than just printing a message, the agent could, for example, open a GitHub issue on its repository describing the problem it faced and labeling it for human review. It could also integrate with Q&A services or documentation: for instance, automatically searching an internal FAQ or even querying an external API (like Stack Overflow or a company knowledge base) when it encounters errors, then trying the advice it finds. As the multi-agent ecosystem grows, an agent could route its question to a specialized “Helper” agent – imagine one agent focused on coding tasks asking another agent that’s hooked up to documentation for pointers. Additionally, with the expansion across repositories, an agent might seek help from agents in other projects that have solved similar problems (a form of inter-agent collaboration). The overarching goal is for the agent to be intelligent enough to know its own limitations and to engage with humans or other resources in a positive, security-conscious way to overcome those limitations. This ensures the system remains robust and continuously improving, without drifting into failure modes silently.
