# Mission Statement

edge-cache-cli bridges the gap between local development and production‑grade edge caching environments. 
By simulating real‑world caching rules and behaviors, our tool enables teams to experiment with caching strategies, 
validate performance optimizations, and streamline deployment processes using modern web server libraries and local simulation techniques.
