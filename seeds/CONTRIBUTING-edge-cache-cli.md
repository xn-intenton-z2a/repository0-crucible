# edge-cache-cli

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **edge-cache-cli**—a forward‑thinking JavaScript library and CLI tool designed to simulate, test, and manage edge caching strategies for modern web applications. Built with Node 20 and ECMAScript Modules, edge-cache-cli helps developers and DevOps engineers mimic CDN behavior locally to optimize caching configurations before deployment.

## Mission Statement

edge-cache-cli bridges the gap between local development and production‑grade edge caching environments. By simulating real‑world caching rules and behaviors, our tool enables teams to experiment with caching strategies, validate performance optimizations, and streamline deployment processes using modern web server libraries and local simulation techniques.

## How to Contribute

1. **Report Issues & Suggest Features:**  
   If you encounter bugs or have suggestions for new functionality, please open a GitHub issue with detailed descriptions, configuration examples, or performance metrics.

2. **Submit Pull Requests:**
   - **Fork & Branch:** Fork the repository and create a branch for your feature or bugfix.
   - **Implement & Test:** Write clean, modular code following our style guidelines, and include both unit and integration tests.
   - **Documentation:** Update usage guides, examples, and this CONTRIBUTING.md file as necessary.
   - **Pull Request:** Submit your pull request and engage in collaborative review.

3. **Enhance the Simulation Engine:**  
   Contribute improvements to our caching simulation—whether by refining algorithms, adding configuration options, or optimizing performance based on real-world CDN behavior.

4. **Improve Documentation:**  
   Help clarify setup instructions, add detailed examples, and document configuration parameters for simulating edge caching scenarios.

## Guidelines

- **Code Quality:**  
  Write clean, maintainable code using modern JavaScript practices (Node 20, ESM). Ensure your changes are well-documented and backward compatible.

- **Testing:**  
  Comprehensive tests are crucial. Please add tests that cover new features and edge cases to ensure our simulation accurately reflects expected behaviors.

- **Commit Messages:**  
  Use clear, descriptive commit messages that capture the intent and scope of your changes.

- **Collaboration:**  
  Participate constructively in GitHub issues and pull requests. Your insights and feedback help evolve edge-cache-cli into a powerful local simulation tool.

## Issue House Choice Options

repository specific activities:
- Create, vary or extend as many library functions as you can that deliver the spirit of this CONTRIBUTING.md Update the Change Log in README.md (or say what was checked).

generic activities:
- Review the Mission Statement and prune any "drift" from the source file where there are no longer relevant features. Update the Change Log in README.md (or say what was checked).
- Review the Mission Statement and create, vary or extend as many features as you can inline with the Mission Statement. Update the Change Log in README.md (or say what was checked).
  #- Find anything that might be a "simulated" or "demo" implementation and switch to a real implementation. Update the Change Log in README.md (or say what was checked).
  #- Consider alternate code paths that could be explicitly handled to improve the range of supported behaviours. Update the Change Log in README.md (or say what was checked).
  #- Look for code that could be simplified using a library and introduce that library. Update the Change Log in README.md (or say what was checked).

undocumented chores:
#- Look for any duplicated code that could be usefully abstracted out to become shared code and implement that abstraction.
- Refresh the README, consulting the guidance in CONTRIBUTING.md while retaining any relevant content and pruning irrelevant content.
  #- Dry-run any examples in comments or the README against the current code and if they are not accurate or if they could cover more features, update the docs or code to be accurate.
- Bring test coverage up as close to 100% as possible, have single layer mocked tests and deeper tests mocking at the external resource (e.g. file system or network).
  #- Ensure the main function so that it generates some demo output without an over the wire call, and hint a CLI switch that will do the real call.
