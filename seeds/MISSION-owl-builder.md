# Mission Statement

**owl-builder** is a versatile JavaScript library and CLI tool designed to:
- Build OWL ontologies from public data sources.
- Persist and manage ontologies as files.
- Provide intuitive tools for querying via both a CLI and a web interface.
- Integrate supplemental theme ontologies and data crawlers.
- Function as a knowledge base by automatically committing updates.

Our goal is to deliver a robust, user-friendly platform that empowers users to efficiently build and explore ontological data.
