# Mission Statement

**owl-builder** is a JavaScript library and CLI tool designed to:
- Build OWL ontologies from public data sources.
- Read and Persist and OWL ontologies as JSON files.
- Merge OWL ontologies as JSON files.
- Provide tools for querying OWL ontologies stored as JSON via a CLI.
- Generate formats to aid import into a GraphDB such as Neo4j.

owl-builder is a simple CLI tool which will facilitate the creation of OWL ontologies from public data sources, 
and to provide a set of tools for managing the OWL ontologies in a JSON format. The CLI wll use a JavaScript library to
which is also exports functions at the same level as the CLI tool, and a REST API for the same functions.
