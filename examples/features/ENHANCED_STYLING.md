# Enhanced Styling

## Overview
This feature refines the CLI output by integrating the Chalk library to provide dynamic, color-coded, and styled log messages. By wrapping all console outputs in the CLI agent with distinct color schemes based on the message type (e.g. help-seeking, replication, self-improvement, planning, and reset messages), the output becomes more user-friendly and informative. This enhancement improves readability and assists developers in quickly identifying the state and intent of the logs.

## Implementation Details

### Source File Update (src/lib/main.js)
- **Import Chalk:**
  - Add `import chalk from 'chalk';` at the top of the file.

- **Wrap Console Logs:**
  - Update `logCLIArgs(args)` to output calls using `chalk.blue` for the JSON string of the arguments.
  - In `logExecutionTime()`, wrap the execution time message with `chalk.gray`.
  - In `handleHelpSeeking()`, log the help-seeking activation message with `chalk.yellow.bold`.
  - In `replicateTasks()`, output each replication task message using `chalk.cyan`.
  - In `handleSelfImprove()`, output diagnostic metrics prefixed with `chalk.magenta` to highlight self-improvement details.
  - In `planTasks()`, use `chalk.green` to log planning mode messages.
  - In `handleDecompose()`, style the goal decomposition headers with `chalk.blueBright`.
  - When persisting the memory log (both to console and file), use `chalk.green` for success confirmation messages.

### Test File Update (tests/unit/main.test.js)
- **Non-functional Changes:**
  - The tests continue to validate that the expected log messages are output. Since the tests use regular expressions to match patterns, update the expected string patterns to account for ANSI escape sequences if necessary, or verify that the output includes the base text (e.g., "Run with:").

### README Update (README.md)
- **Usage Documentation:**
  - Add a note under a new section or in the Features section describing that the CLI now uses enhanced colored output via Chalk to improve readability.
  - Include a sample command output snippet showing colored logs.

### Dependencies File Update (package.json)
- Add the Chalk library to dependencies:
  ```json
  "chalk": "^5.0.0"
  ```

## Testing & Compatibility
- Run `npm test` to verify that the styled outputs are present and that ANSI escape sequences are included in the log outputs.
- Validate that in non-TTY environments (or when the environment variable `FORCE_COLOR=0` is set), Chalk disables styling appropriately.

## Future Considerations
- Consider adding configuration options (via CLI flags or environment variables) to toggle styling on or off.
- Future iterations may support theming options that allow users to customize color schemes further.
