# ONTOLOGY SERVICE

The ONTOLOGY SERVICE is the core engine of owl-builder, integrating dynamic live data retrieval with robust diagnostics, anomaly detection, and real-time notifications. This module is responsible for building, maintaining, validating, and exporting OWL ontologies using live, verified public data sources. It provides a resilient architecture that adapts to changing data sources and implements comprehensive telemetry and CLI support.

## Live Data Integration
- **Dynamic Data Retrieval:** Leverages configurable retry logic, exponential backoff, and jitter to fetch live data from trusted endpoints.
- **Flexible Refresh Modes:** Supports scheduled and on-demand updates through CLI commands and HTTP endpoints.
- **Fallback Strategy:** Uses a legacy static fallback mechanism for emergency resilience if live data retrieval encounters issues.

## Diagnostics, Telemetry, and Anomaly Detection
- **Enhanced Diagnostic Logging:** Incorporates detailed, timestamped logs including non-numeric environment variable handling with aggregated telemetry for NaN fallback incidents.
- **Real-Time Anomaly Detection:** Validates incoming data by checking for the presence and quality of the `entries` array. On detecting anomalies, logs diagnostic warnings and triggers appropriate WebSocket alerts.
- **Aggregated Telemetry Export:** Provides CLI commands (e.g., `--export-telemetry` and `--diagnostic-summary-naN`) to export telemetry data and view aggregated diagnostic summaries.

## API and CLI Enhancements
- **Comprehensive CLI Commands:** Offers commands for live data ontology building (`--build-live`), anomaly detection (`--detect-anomaly`), telemetry export, and other diagnostic features. 
- **User-Focused Interface:** Incorporates CLI override capabilities and clear messaging, ensuring predictable behavior across various environments.

## Real-Time Notifications and Resilience
- **WebSocket Integration:** Broadcasts real-time notifications to connected clients on key events such as ontology updates, anomaly detection, and data refreshes.
- **Robust Error Handling:** Merges live and legacy data sourcing with standardized error handling to ensure operational resilience and mission alignment.

## Mission Alignment
- **Live and Verified Data:** Ensures that ontology construction is driven by current, trusted public data sources, fully supporting the mission of delivering dynamic, reliable ontologies.
- **Consistent Performance:** Maintains high availability and robust fallback strategies to handle network variations and data anomalies without service disruption.
