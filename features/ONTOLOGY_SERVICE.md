# ONTOLOGY SERVICE

The Ontology Service is the central engine of owl-builder, responsible for building, updating, validating, and persisting OWL ontologies using live, verified public data sources. In addition to robust live data integration, it features real-time anomaly detection, advanced diagnostic telemetry, and automated rollback capabilities to ensure data integrity and operational resilience.

## Live Data Integration

- **Dynamic Data Fetching:** Retrieves live data from trusted public APIs with built-in retry logic, exponential backoff, and jitter for robust performance.
- **Fallback Mechanism:** When live data retrieval fails or anomalies are detected, the service reverts to a legacy static ontology build as an emergency fallback.
- **CLI Overrides:** Supports CLI parameters (such as retry count and initial delay) to adjust live data fetching behavior for flexible deployments.

## Real-Time Anomaly Detection

- **Schema Validation:** Ensures that critical properties (like the `entries` array) exist and are non-empty in the fetched data; errors in data structure prompt immediate warnings.
- **Simulation Mode:** Provides CLI commands (e.g. `--detect-anomaly`) to simulate anomaly states for testing and debugging, ensuring full exercise of error handling workflows.

## Diagnostic Telemetry and Environment Variable Handling

- **Aggregated Diagnostics:** Collects and batches warnings from non-numeric or malformed environment variable inputs, with debounced asynchronous batching to prevent log flooding.
- **Flexible Export Options:** Supports exporting diagnostic telemetry in multiple formats (JSON or CSV) via dedicated CLI commands (`--export-telemetry`, `--diagnostic-summary-naN`).
- **Consistent Normalization:** All environment variables are normalized inline to maintain consistency and clarity across the application.

## WebSocket Notifications

- **Real-Time Alerts:** Integrates a WebSocket server that broadcasts notifications whenever key operations occur (e.g., ontology refreshes, updates, merges, or rollbacks).
- **Detailed Payloads:** Notifications include metadata such as the updated ontology title, version, timestamp, and a descriptive status message, ensuring proactive system monitoring.

## Automated Rollback Mechanism

- **Immediate Recovery:** Upon detection of live data anomalies (such as missing or empty `entries`), the service automatically attempts to restore the last known good ontology from `ontology-backup.json`.
- **Transparent Communication:** Success or failure of the rollback is immediately broadcast via WebSocket along with detailed diagnostic messages.
- **CLI Integration:** Dedicated CLI commands facilitate testing of the rollback mechanism; for example, the `--detect-anomaly` flag can trigger simulated anomaly conditions and observe the rollback process.

## Usage & Benefits

- **Enhanced Reliability:** Combines live data integration with robust anomaly detection and recovery, ensuring that the ontology remains accurate and up-to-date.
- **Operational Transparency:** Real-time telemetry and notifications provide ongoing insight into system performance and health, aiding rapid triage when issues arise.
- **Flexible Deployment:** With comprehensive CLI overrides and simulation modes, administrators can customize and test the behavior of the ontology service in diverse environments.

Overall, the Ontology Service not only builds and manages ontologies but also enforces data integrity and system resilience by proactively addressing anomalies through automated rollback and comprehensive diagnostic feedback.
