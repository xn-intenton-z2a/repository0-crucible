# Ontology Service

This feature consolidates the existing Ontology API and Ontology Engine into a single, cohesive service that manages all ontology operations. It exposes a unified interface for both interactive CLI commands and RESTful HTTP endpoints. In addition to the core live data integration, backup, refresh, merge operations, and various ontology models, this feature introduces an authentication layer for secure API access.

## Overview

- **Unified Management:** Merges the functionality of the legacy Ontology API and Ontology Engine into one comprehensive service. Users can manage ontologies via CLI commands or communicate with the system through RESTful endpoints.
- **Live Data Integration & Fallback:** Leverages live, verified public endpoints for dynamic ontology building while retaining a legacy static fallback for emergency use.
- **Authentication Layer:** Introduces security for API operations by supporting API key checks or token-based authentication (configurable via environment variables). This ensures that sensitive update or delete operations are restricted to authorized clients.
- **Diagnostic Integration:** Integrates fully with the enhanced diagnostics system to log and monitor both general operations and authentication events.

## Implementation Details

- **Endpoint Consolidation:**
  - RESTful endpoints such as GET, POST, and DELETE for ontology management will be unified under a common HTTP handler.
  - Interactive CLI commands will use the same underlying logic for data persistence, refresh, merge and other operations.

- **Authentication:**
  - The service will check for an environment variable (e.g. `API_KEY`) or a configured JWT secret. On API calls that modify data (POST, DELETE), the service will require an `Authorization` header with the correct API key or token.
  - Unauthorized requests will receive an appropriate HTTP status code (401 Unauthorized) and an error payload.

- **Integration with Diagnostics:**
  - All API events including authentication failures are logged using the existing multi-channel diagnostics system, ensuring that any security issues or misconfigurations are captured in real-time.
  - Telemetry data will also include information on unauthorized access attempts.

- **Configuration and Flexibility:**
  - Users can configure authentication modes (API key or token), enable strict mode for input validation, and adjust CLI override precedence via environment variables and CLI flags.
  - The service will expose diagnostic summaries, including aggregated telemetry for security and operational events.

## Benefits

- **Streamlined Codebase:** By merging the Ontology API and Ontology Engine, maintenance is simplified and code duplication is reduced.
- **Enhanced Security:** The new authentication layer ensures that API endpoints are protected from unauthorized access, making the tool more robust in multi-user or production environments.
- **Unified Experience:** Users benefit from a consistent interface whether interacting via CLI or HTTP, with all operations audited through comprehensive diagnostics.
- **Future Extensibility:** A consolidated service simplifies future enhancements such as role-based access control, rate-limiting, or advanced logging features.
