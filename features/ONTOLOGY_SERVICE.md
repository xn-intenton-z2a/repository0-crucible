# Ontology Service

This feature consolidates all ontology management functionalities into a single, cohesive service. It provides support for both CLI and RESTful HTTP interactions to build, update, query, and manage ontologies. Key operations include live data integration, secure data handling, diagnostic logging, and an enhanced telemetry module.

## Overview

- **Unified Management:** Combines legacy ontology APIs with dynamic live data integration, providing both CLI commands and HTTP endpoints for ontology operations.
- **Live Data Integration & Fallback:** Leverages verified public endpoints to construct ontologies in real time while retaining a static fallback for emergency use.
- **Authentication & Security:** Secures data-modifying operations via API keys or token-based mechanisms, with robust diagnostic logging for unauthorized access.
- **Enhanced Diagnostics & Telemetry:** Captures detailed diagnostic logs and aggregates telemetry for environment variable parsing anomalies, including NaN fallback events. Telemetry data can be exported as a JSON file on demand using a CLI flag.

## Telemetry API Extension

In addition to the existing CLI-based telemetry export, this update introduces an HTTP API endpoint to provide real-time access to aggregated diagnostic telemetry data. This endpoint enhances observability by allowing operators and developers to query telemetry details via a simple REST call.

### Implementation Details

- **HTTP Endpoint Addition:** Extend the existing ontology service HTTP server to include a new endpoint `/telemetry`.
  - When this endpoint is accessed, it calls the function `getAggregatedNaNSummary()` to retrieve telemetry data.
  - The endpoint responds with a JSON payload containing details such as the count of non-numeric environment variable occurrences, the raw input values, CLI override status, and timestamps.
- **Security Considerations:** Optionally restrict access to the `/telemetry` endpoint based on environment configurations or authentication tokens.
- **Seamless Integration:** Ensure that the new telemetry API coexists with existing ontology operations without adding extra dependencies or complexity.

## Benefits

- **Real-Time Diagnostics:** Provides immediate access to aggregated telemetry data for monitoring environment variable anomalies and other diagnostic events.
- **Enhanced Observability:** Facilitates proactive troubleshooting and auditing of configuration issues by exposing detailed telemetry insights via an API.
- **Unified User Experience:** Merges telemetry export and retrieval within the same service, ensuring consistency across CLI and HTTP interfaces.
- **Ease of Integration:** Operators can integrate the telemetry endpoint with external monitoring systems and dashboards for improved system operational visibility.

This extension solidifies the mission of providing live, reliable, and observable ontology management by enhancing real-time diagnostic capabilities.
