# Ontology Service

The Ontology Service is the core engine for owl-builder, responsible for building, updating, validating, and persisting OWL ontologies from verified live data sources. This service has been enhanced to ensure robust live data integration, real-time diagnostics, and comprehensive telemetry.

# Live Data Integration

- Uses live public APIs to fetch up-to-date ontology data.
- Implements retry logic with exponential backoff and jitter for robust data fetching.
- Includes a fallback mechanism to a legacy static ontology build function in case of live data failures.

# Real-Time Anomaly Detection

- Integrates anomaly detection to validate live data against expected schema requirements.
- Logs detailed diagnostic messages when data anomalies (such as absent or empty 'entries') are detected.
- Triggers WebSocket alerts with detailed status updates on any anomalies detected during data fetch operations.

# Diagnostic Telemetry and Environment Variable Handling

- Processes environment variables with normalization to ensure reliable configuration, even with malformed inputs.
- Aggregates telemetry for non-numeric inputs to avoid flooding logs using a debounced batching mechanism.
- Supports CLI overrides and strict mode for enhanced operational safety.
- Provides a CLI command to export aggregated telemetry data to a file for further analysis.

# WebSocket Notifications

- Incorporates a WebSocket server to broadcast real-time notifications when key ontology operations occur (e.g., refresh, update, merge).
- Notifications include metadata such as updated ontology title, version, timestamp, and a descriptive status message.

# Persistence, Query, and Export Functionality

- Enables ontology persistence (saving and loading), backing up, and clearing the ontology file.
- Offers robust querying capabilities to search through ontology concepts.
- Supports export and import functionality to and from OWL XML format.

This feature not only consolidates the core ontology generation and management operations but also provides real-time diagnostics and feedback mechanisms that enhance observability and reliability in live data scenarios.
