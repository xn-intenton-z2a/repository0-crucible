# ONTOLOGY_SERVICE

The ONTOLOGY_SERVICE feature delivers a comprehensive framework for managing and integrating dynamic OWL ontologies using live, verified public data sources. In addition to data retrieval, robust diagnostics, and persistence, this feature now includes real-time anomaly detection to enhance data integrity checks and operational alerts.

# Live Data Integration

- **Dynamic Data Retrieval:** Periodically fetches and refreshes ontology data from multiple verified endpoints.
- **Manual Triggering:** CLI and HTTP endpoints allow on-demand refreshes or updates.
- **Static Fallback:** An emergency static fallback mode is available when live data is inaccessible.

# HTTP API & CLI Endpoints

- **API Endpoints:** Support GET/POST operations for fetching ontology JSON, triggering refresh, updating metadata, exporting in OWL XML, querying, and diagnostics.
- **CLI Commands:** Offers comprehensive command line options (e.g., --build-live, --refresh, --detect-anomaly) to enable live data operations and troubleshooting.

# Enhanced Diagnostics & Telemetry

- **Detailed Logging:** Implements exponential backoff, jitter for retries, and aggregates telemetry for environment variable anomalies.
- **Environment Safety:** Warns and falls back when non-numeric environment variables are detected, controlled via thresholds and strict mode options.

# Real-Time Anomaly Detection

- **Anomaly Verification:** Validates live data against expected schema (e.g., ensuring existence of a non-empty 'entries' array).
- **Automatic Alerts:** When anomalies (like missing or empty key properties) are detected, detailed diagnostic logs are generated and a WebSocket notification is broadcast.
- **CLI Testing:** The --detect-anomaly command allows users to simulate and confirm anomaly detection functionality with sample data.

# WebSocket Notifications

- **Real-Time Updates:** Broadcasts JSON payloads—for instance, during refresh, merge, or anomaly detection events—to all connected clients.
- **Robust Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with the HTTP server, ensuring immediate operational visibility.

This enhanced specification aligns with the project mission of building live-data driven ontologies, ensuring operational resilience and proactive diagnostic capability.
