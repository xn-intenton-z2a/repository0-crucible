# ONTOLOGY_SERVICE

The ONTOLOGY_SERVICE feature integrates live data processing with robust diagnostics and real-time notifications. It is designed to build, update, validate, and export dynamic OWL ontologies sourced from public data endpoints while consolidating legacy fallback mechanisms for emergencies.

# Live Data Integration

- **Dynamic Data Retrieval:** Fetches live data from trusted public endpoints (e.g., https://api.publicapis.org/entries), with a fallback to a static legacy mode only for emergencies.
- **Scheduled & Manual Refresh:** Supports CLI and HTTP endpoints for on-demand refreshes and scheduled updates.
- **Retry & Backoff Mechanisms:** Implements exponential backoff with jitter for handling network errors and ensuring data consistency.

# Diagnostics, Telemetry & Anomaly Detection

- **Enhanced Logging & Diagnostics:** Provides detailed timestamped logs, warnings for environment variable issues, and aggregated telemetry for non-numeric fallback events.
- **Environment Variable Parsing:** Normalizes input values and enforces strict mode option to ensure numeric integrity. Aggregates warnings using a configurable threshold.
- **Real-Time Anomaly Detection:** Validates live data to check for anomalies (e.g., missing or empty 'entries') and triggers diagnostic logs and WebSocket notifications if issues are detected.
- **Telemetry Export:** Offers a CLI command (`--export-telemetry`) to export aggregated telemetry data such as NaN fallback summaries and diagnostic summaries to a JSON file.

# CLI and HTTP API Endpoints

- **Comprehensive Operations:** Supports a variety of commands including building, updating, querying, backing up, refreshing, merging, and custom ontology creation.
- **Diagnostic & Anomaly CLI Commands:** Includes CLI options to force anomaly detection (`--detect-anomaly`), view aggregated telemetry (`--diagnostic-summary-naN`), and export telemetry data.

# WebSocket Notifications

- **Real-Time Updates:** Integrates a WebSocket server that broadcasts JSON notifications on crucial operations such as ontology refresh, anomaly detection, and merging.
- **Operational Monitoring:** Ensures connected clients receive updates with detailed payloads (ontology title, version, timestamp, and status message) during live operations.

This comprehensive feature encapsulates all critical aspects of building resilient, live-data driven ontologies, ensuring both data integrity and operational transparency in line with the project mission.
