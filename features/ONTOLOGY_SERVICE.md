# ONTOLOGY_SERVICE

The ONTOLOGY_SERVICE feature is the core of owl-builder, integrating live data retrieval, robust diagnostics, and real-time notifications to build dynamic OWL ontologies. This feature has been refined to align even more closely with the mission of using live, verified public data sources while ensuring operational transparency and resilience.

# Live Data Integration
- **Dynamic Data Retrieval:** Continues fetching data from trusted public endpoints with configurable retry logic, exponential backoff, and jitter. This ensures timely and robust data collection.
- **Flexible Refresh Modes:** Supports both scheduled and on-demand refresh through CLI commands and HTTP endpoints.
- **Fallback Mechanisms:** Retains legacy static build as an emergency fallback when live data is unavailable.

# Diagnostics, Telemetry & Anomaly Detection
- **Enhanced Logging:** Provides detailed, timestamped logs for debugging and operational monitoring. Uses aggregated telemetry to record NaN fallback events and environment variable issues.
- **Real-Time Anomaly Detection:** Validates live data against an expected schema (ensuring the presence of a non-empty 'entries' array) and triggers diagnostic logs plus WebSocket alerts upon detection of anomalies.
- **Telemetry Export:** Incorporates a CLI command (`--export-telemetry`) that aggregates diagnostic summaries and NaN fallback data into a JSON file, aiding in post-mortem analysis and continuous improvement.

# API and CLI Enhancements
- **Comprehensive CLI Commands:** Expands available CLI options to include anomaly detection testing (`--detect-anomaly`), real-time status updates, and advanced telemetry reporting.
- **WebSocket Notifications:** Implements a WebSocket server for broadcasting real-time updates upon key operations (e.g., refresh, update, merge), ensuring operators are immediately informed of critical events.

# Mission Alignment and Resilience
- **Mission-Driven Approach:** Focuses on delivering reliable, live-data-driven ontology building as per the mission statement. The feature enhances the system's resilience by integrating fallback strategies and extensive diagnostics.
- **Improved Environment Handling:** Consolidates environment variable parsing, normalization, and telemetry aggregation to ensure predictable behavior across deployment environments.

This refined ONTOLOGY_SERVICE feature encapsulates and extends the core functionalities of owl-builder to meet the challenges of dynamic data integration and operational transparency in a single, streamlined repository.
