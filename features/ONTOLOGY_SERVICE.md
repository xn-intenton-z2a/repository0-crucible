# ONTOLOGY_SERVICE

The ONTOLOGY_SERVICE feature is the core component of owl-builder, responsible for building and maintaining dynamic OWL ontologies using live, verified public data sources. This enhanced service integrates robust live data retrieval, extensive diagnostics, real-time notifications, and additional safety mechanisms to ensure operational resilience.

# Live Data Integration
- **Dynamic Data Retrieval:** Fetches live data from trusted public endpoints with configurable retry logic, exponential backoff, and jitter to ensure robust and timely collection.
- **Flexible Refresh Modes:** Supports both scheduled and on-demand data refreshes through CLI commands and HTTP endpoints.
- **Fallback Mechanism:** Retains a legacy static fallback for emergency use when live data retrieval fails.

# Diagnostics and Telemetry
- **Enhanced Logging:** Provides detailed, timestamped diagnostic logs for debugging, including handling of non-numeric environment variables with aggregated telemetry on NaN fallback incidents.
- **Aggregated Telemetry Export:** Implements a CLI command (`--export-telemetry`) that collects aggregated diagnostic and telemetry data into a JSON file, facilitating post-mortem analysis and continuous monitoring.

# Real-Time Anomaly Detection
- **Data Validation:** Validates live data against a defined schema (ensuring an `entries` property exists as a non-empty array) and triggers diagnostic logs when anomalies are detected.
- **WebSocket Notifications:** Broadcasts real-time alerts to connected clients when anomalies or critical data events occur, ensuring operators are alerted immediately to any issues.

# API and CLI Enhancements
- **Comprehensive CLI Commands:** Extends the CLI to include commands for anomaly detection (`--detect-anomaly`), live data ontology building (`--build-live`), telemetry export (`--export-telemetry`), and additional diagnostics.
- **User-Focused Diagnostics:** Includes detailed error handling, environment variable normalization, and CLI override capabilities to maintain predictable behavior across environments.

# Mission Alignment and Resilience
- **Mission-Driven Approach:** Ensures that ontology building is driven by live, public data, aligning with the mission of creating dynamic and reliable ontologies using verified online sources.
- **Resilient Operations:** Incorporates fallback strategies and enhanced logging mechanisms so that the system remains robust even under adverse conditions.
