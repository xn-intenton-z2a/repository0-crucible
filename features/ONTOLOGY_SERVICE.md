# ONTOLOGY_SERVICE

## Overview
The ONTOLOGY_SERVICE feature is designed to provide a unified module for managing OWL ontologies in real-time. It integrates live data retrieval, automated refresh routines, diagnostic telemetry, and robust environment configuration management. This feature not only enables live data integration with scheduled auto refreshes but also incorporates detailed diagnostics for environment variable parsing and other operational parameters.

## Live Data & Auto Refresh
- **Live Data Integration:** Builds ontologies from verified live data sources, ensuring that the model remains current.
- **Scheduled Auto Refresh:** Utilizes the `AUTO_REFRESH_INTERVAL` environment variable to automatically refresh the ontology at configurable intervals, updating the ontology with the latest live data.
- **Manual Override:** Allows users to manually trigger ontology refreshes via CLI flags (e.g., `--refresh`).

## Environment & Diagnostic Telemetry
- **Advanced Environment Variable Parsing:** Uses robust inline utilities to normalize environment variable values by trimming whitespace and collapsing non-breaking spaces. This ensures consistent configuration inputs.
- **Aggregated Diagnostic Telemetry:** Monitors non-numeric or malformed environment variable inputs, logging a one-time (per unique normalized invalid input) warning with a detailed telemetry object which includes the raw value, timestamp, and whether a CLI override was applied.
- **CLI Overrides & Strict Mode:** Supports CLI flags (e.g., `--livedata-retry-default`, `--livedata-delay-default`) that override environment settings. When strict mode is enabled (via `--strict-env` or setting `STRICT_ENV=true`), non-numeric inputs throw immediate errors to enforce configuration integrity.
- **Telemetry Summary:** Aggregated telemetry data for environment parsing anomalies (NaN fallback events) is available via the `--diagnostic-summary-naN` CLI flag.

## Security & Notification Integration
- **API Key Verification:** Secures data-modifying operations by enforcing API key checks.
- **Real-Time Notifications:** Integrates with the WebSocket notification system to broadcast updates (e.g., after a refresh or merge) along with diagnostic information.
- **Diagnostic Logging:** Consolidates logs for live data operations and environment configuration anomalies, making troubleshooting more straightforward.

## Benefits and User Impact
- **Timely Data Updates:** Ensures that ontologies are built and refreshed from the most current live data sources, reducing the risk of stale information.
- **Enhanced Diagnostic Insight:** Detailed and aggregated telemetry for environment variable parsing aids developers in identifying configuration issues promptly.
- **Simplified Configuration Management:** CLI overrides and strict mode options provide users with greater control and assurance over system reliability.
- **Secure & Real-Time Operations:** Seamlessly integrates security measures and real-time client notifications, aligning with the overall mission of delivering dynamic, live data-driven ontology management.

## Implementation Details
- **Centralized Module:** Consolidates ontology construction routines (model building, live data fetching, and refresh operations) into one cohesive service.
- **Promise-Based Batching:** Uses asynchronous batching to ensure that diagnostic warnings for configuration issues are logged exactly once per unique invalid input.
- **Integration with Existing Telemetry:** Merges environment variable diagnostics with diagnostic telemetry for overall system health monitoring.
- **Consistent API:** Offers a predictable and well-documented interface where live data integration, diagnostics, and notifications work in harmony.
