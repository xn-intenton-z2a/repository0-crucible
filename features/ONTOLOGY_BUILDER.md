# ONTOLOGY_BUILDER

## Overview
The ONTOLOGY_BUILDER feature empowers the repository to generate dynamic OWL ontologies based on the evolving JSON Schemas and live, verified public data sources. This module complements the core schema diff and migration functionalities, offering API teams a way to bridge traditional schema management with semantic web technologies in a streamlined, CLI-integrated workflow.

## Functionality
- **Live Data Integration:** Connects to curated public data sources to fetch structured data that informs the ontology generation process.
- **OWL Ontology Generation:** Transforms JSON Schema definitions into OWL ontologies, expanding on the existing conversion capabilities within SCHEMA_MANAGER.
- **CLI Command:** Introduce a dedicated CLI flag (`--build-ontology`) to trigger the ontology building process, including options for periodic updates and on-demand generation.
- **Customization & Configuration:** Provides configuration options via CLI parameters or environment variables to tailor the ontology extraction (e.g., selection of data sources, filtering rules, and update frequency).

## Implementation & Testing
- **Single-File Module:** Implement the ONTOLOGY_BUILDER in a dedicated source file, for example `src/lib/ontology_builder.js`, ensuring it encapsulates all functionalities and has a clean interface.
- **Integration with SCHEMA_MANAGER:** Leverage the existing JSON Schema parsing and conversion functionalities by integrating with SCHEMA_MANAGER, while keeping ontology-specific logic distinct.
- **Testing:** Develop unit and integration tests covering various scenarios including live data fetching, conversion accuracy, CLI command execution, and error handling. Tests should simulate both normal and edge-case conditions.

## Value Proposition
By adding ONTOLOGY_BUILDER, the repository not only continues to simplify JSON Schema evolution but also expands its reach into the semantic web space. This added functionality enables teams to automatically generate and update OWL ontologies, facilitating enhanced interoperability and richer metadata extraction from API definitions.
