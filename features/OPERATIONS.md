# OPERATIONS

## Overview
The OPERATIONS feature consolidates system diagnostics and CI/CD workflow management into a unified command line tool. It provides robust troubleshooting, platform health checks, and automated process management. This feature brings together the capabilities of the former DIAGNOSTICS and WORKFLOWS modules to streamline environment verifications, module connectivity checks, automated build and deployment triggers, and change documentation updates.

## Features
- **Environment & System Diagnostics**:
  - Verify Node.js version compatibility and dependency integrity.
  - Detect misconfigurations or invalid environment variables and automatically fallback to safe defaults.
  - Perform module health checks for core components, ensuring connectivity and proper initialization.
  
- **Automated CI/CD Workflow Triggers**:
  - Integrate with GitHub Actions to automatically run tests, benchmarks, and build tasks on new commits.
  - Support manual triggers via CLI flags for intermediate and enhanced builds, along with merge-persistence operations.
  
- **Changelog and Documentation Updates**:
  - Monitor code and schema changes to auto-generate changelogs and update documentation in multiple formats.
  
- **HTTP & CLI Integration**:
  - Provide a lightweight HTTP endpoint for remote triggering of diagnostics and workflow actions.
  - Offer a unified CLI command structure to manage all operations including self-tests and performance monitoring.

## Implementation & Testing
- **Single-File Modularization**:
  - Implement the OPERATIONS functionality in a dedicated source file (e.g., `src/lib/operations.js`) to encapsulate diagnostics and workflow operations.
  - Update `src/lib/main.js` to delegate command parsing and execution to the OPERATIONS module.

- **Testing Strategy**:
  - Develop comprehensive unit and integration tests to cover normal and edge-case scenarios in environment verification, automated triggers, and HTTP endpoint functionalities.
  - Ensure proper validation of system state, robust error handling, and accurate changelog generation.

## Value Proposition
By consolidating DIAGNOSTICS and WORKFLOWS into OPERATIONS, the repository offers a streamlined interface with enhanced operational resilience and efficiency. The unified approach simplifies troubleshooting and automates essential CI/CD processes, aligning with our mission to simplify API change management and provide actionable insights during development and deployment cycles.
