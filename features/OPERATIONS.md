# OPERATIONS

## Overview
The OPERATIONS feature consolidates system diagnostics, CI/CD workflow management, and now unified reporting into a single, streamlined command line tool. It provides robust troubleshooting, platform health checks, automated process management, and a comprehensive view of schema evolution and related activities. This unified approach simplifies environment verifications and empowers developers to quickly assess the state of their JSON Schema lifecycle.

## Environment & System Diagnostics
- **System Checks:** Verify Node.js version compatibility and dependency integrity.
- **Configuration Validation:** Detect misconfigurations or invalid environment variables and automatically fallback to safe defaults.
- **Module Health:** Perform connectivity and initialization checks for core components.

## Automated CI/CD Workflow Triggers
- **GitHub Actions Integration:** Automatically run tests, benchmarks, and build tasks on new commits.
- **Manual CLI Triggers:** Execute intermediate or enhanced builds and merge-persistence operations using dedicated CLI flags.

## Changelog and Documentation Updates
- **Auto-Generation:** Monitor code and schema changes to generate detailed changelogs and update documentation in multiple formats.
- **Real-time Sync:** Ensure documentation is always in sync with the latest repository state.

## Unified Reporting
- **Consolidated Insights:** Aggregate outputs from JSON Schema diff generation, risk analysis, and plugin system statuses into a single, comprehensive report.
- **Multi-format Reports:** Generate reports in JSON, Markdown, and HTML, providing both tabular and graphical summaries.
- **Accessibility:** Expose a dedicated CLI flag (`--report`) and an HTTP endpoint for retrieving real-time consolidated operational reports.
- **Scheduled Reporting:** Support the scheduling of periodic report generation to aid continuous monitoring and decision-making.

## HTTP & CLI Integration
- **Unified Command Interface:** Integrate diagnostics, workflow triggers, and unified reporting under a cohesive CLI command structure.
- **Remote Triggering:** Provide lightweight HTTP endpoints for remote operations, including the retrieval of unified reports.

## Implementation & Testing
- **Single-File Modularization:** Implement all enhancements, including unified reporting, in a dedicated source file (e.g., `src/lib/operations.js`).
- **Extensive Testing:** Develop unit and integration tests covering diagnostics, CI/CD triggers, report generation, and HTTP endpoint functionality.
- **Documentation Updates:** Update repository documentation to include usage examples for new CLI flags and HTTP endpoints.

## Value Proposition
By consolidating diagnostics, automated workflows, and unified reporting, the OPERATIONS feature offers a one-stop solution for real-time infrastructure monitoring and decision support. This enhancement not only streamlines troubleshooting and CI/CD processes but also provides comprehensive visibility into schema changes and system health, aligning with our mission to simplify API change management and empower developer collaboration.
