# Overview
The REPORTER feature introduces an aggregated reporting layer on top of the existing schema management and evolution framework. It collects and analyzes schema diff reports, risk assessments, and version histories over time to provide actionable insights and trend analytics for API developers.

# Functionality
- **Aggregated Analytics:** Collects diff reports, risk scores, and version history data from the SCHEMA_MANAGER to generate comprehensive trend analyses.
- **Report Generation:** Supports multiple output formats (Markdown, HTML) and includes interactive elements such as charts and tables for data visualization.
- **CLI Integration:** Adds a new CLI flag (`--report`) that generates a full report summarizing historical changes, potential risks, and schema evolution trends.
- **HTTP Endpoint:** Optionally exposes a lightweight HTTP API for remote report generation and retrieval of analytics data.

# Implementation & Testing
- **Single-File Module:** Implement the REPORTER in its own source file (e.g., `src/lib/reporter.js`) to encapsulate report aggregation and generation functions.
- **Data Integration:** Integrate with the updated SCHEMA_MANAGER (which now includes functionalities from SCHEMA_WATCHER) to pull lifecycle data regularly.
- **Unit & Integration Tests:** Extend the testing suite with simulations of schema evolution events and verify the accuracy of generated reports. Ensure the CLI and HTTP endpoint produce expected outputs under normal and edge-case scenarios.

# Value Proposition
By providing a consolidated view of schema evolution data, the REPORTER empowers teams to make data-driven decisions regarding API changes. It links historical changes with actionable insights, reinforcing the repositoryâ€™s mission to simplify API change management and facilitate proactive risk mitigation.
