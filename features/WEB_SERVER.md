# WEB_SERVER

## Overview

This feature establishes a lightweight HTTP web server that acts as a real-time status and monitoring interface for owl-builder. It enables users to quickly check the system’s health, view aggregated diagnostic and telemetry summaries, and access basic ontology and version information via simple HTTP endpoints.

## Implementation Details

- **HTTP Endpoint Integration:** Leverage the existing `serveWebServer` and `startWebServer` functions to launch an HTTP server. The primary endpoint `/` will return a simple text response (e.g., "owl-builder Web Server Running\n") indicating that the tool is operational.
- **Diagnostic & Telemetry Exposure:** Optionally extend the server with additional routes (e.g., `/diag/summary`) that fetch and display aggregated diagnostic telemetry from the Diagnostics Manager, including live data and NaN fallback reports.
- **Minimal Single-File Setup:** The web server functionality is implemented in a single source file (`src/lib/main.js`), aligning with the repository’s design principles and facilitating easy maintenance.
- **Configuration & Logging:** Integrate with global diagnostic settings (using environment variables and `DIAGNOSTIC_LOG_LEVEL`) to ensure that the server’s operational logs include timestamps and diagnostic messages consistent with the overall mission of live data integration.

## Benefits

- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Provides immediate insight into the current operational status and diagnostic telemetry of the system.
- **Enhanced Accessibility:** Enables both CLI users and external systems to query the server for status checks, increasing the tool's utility in automated environments and monitoring setups.
- **Complementary Interface:** Offers an additional user interface to complement existing CLI operations, helping users quickly verify system health without needing to invoke multiple commands.
