# WEB_SERVER: Integrated HTTP, WebSocket & QUERY ENDPOINT

## Overview
This updated WEB_SERVER feature not only provides a status endpoint and real-time WebSocket notifications but now also includes a new RESTful query endpoint. The /query endpoint allows clients to perform ontology searches using query parameters. This update enhances accessibility and integration with external applications, all while maintaining enhanced diagnostics and telemetry support.

## Implementation Details
1. **HTTP Server Enhancements:**
   - **Root Endpoint (`/`):** Continues to serve a plain text status message confirming that the server is running.
   - **Diagnostics and Telemetry Endpoint (`/telemetry`):** Remains available to provide aggregated telemetry data including warnings, NaN fallback logs, and diagnostic summaries. A query parameter (e.g., `?format=csv`) is supported for exporting data in CSV format.
   - **New Query Endpoint (`/query`):** 
     - Accepts a GET request with a query parameter `q` representing the search term for ontology concepts.
     - Internally calls the existing `queryOntology` method to search through persisted ontology data.
     - Returns the matching results in JSON format, facilitating easy integration with other services or for direct client-side querying.

2. **WebSocket Integration:**
   - Remains active to broadcast real-time notifications to clients on ontology operations such as updates, refreshes, merges, and rollbacks.
   - Notifications continue to include key fields like `updatedOntologyTitle`, `version`, `timestamp`, and `statusMessage`.

3. **Configuration and CLI Integration:**
   - The server port remains configurable via the `PORT` environment variable.
   - The CLI flag `--serve` continues to activate the web server, ensuring that both status, telemetry, and now query endpoints are available during runtime.
   - Documentation will be updated to illustrate usage examples for the new /query endpoint, including parameter handling and expected JSON responses.

## Benefits
- **Enhanced Data Accessibility:** External systems, dashboards, or other clients can now query ontology data directly through a RESTful interface, facilitating easier integration.
- **Real-Time Diagnostics & Monitoring:** Continuous real-time WebSocket notifications remain in place, ensuring that any key ontology operations are instantly communicated.
- **Streamlined Operations:** This consolidated web server approach simplifies the architecture by combining status checks, diagnostic telemetry, and ontology querying into a unified system.

## Migration Notes
- Existing functionality (status endpoint, telemetry export, WebSocket notifications) remains unchanged.
- The new `/query` endpoint is an additive enhancement that does not affect backward compatibility. Users should update their integration documentation to include details about the new query functionality.
- No features are being removed, and all prior capabilities are retained within the updated WEB_SERVER feature.
