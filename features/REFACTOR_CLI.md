# Overview

This feature refines the CLI parser implementation in src/lib/main.js by introducing a structured dispatch mechanism to handle various command line flags in a maintainable and testable way. It leverages the existing flags --help, --version, --agentic, --dry-run, --diagnostics, and --capital-cities to trigger distinct behaviors. In addition, the README.md will be updated with clear usage instructions and examples. This update aligns with the mission to provide a versatile CLI tool to manage OWL ontologies.

# Implementation

The main source file (src/lib/main.js) will be updated with a simple mapping of recognized flags to their corresponding handler functions. For instance:

- --help: Print detailed usage instructions.
- --version: Read and display version information from package.json.
- --agentic: Call the agenticHandler function from the agentic library and log the output.
- --dry-run: Simulate the operations without executing changes.
- --diagnostics: Output internal state data to assist with troubleshooting.
- --capital-cities: Generate a sample JSON representation of an OWL ontology for capital cities.

The implementation will include input validation, command alias resolution if necessary, and graceful error handling for unrecognized flags. Only the permitted files (source file, a test file, README and dependencies) will be updated.

# Testing

The test file (tests/unit/main.test.js) will be enhanced to simulate each of the supported CLI flags by setting process.argv accordingly. Tests will assert that the correct output strings are printed and that the proper functions are invoked. Edge cases, such as no flag provided or simultaneous conflicting flags, will be considered.

# Documentation

The README.md file will be revised to include a section on CLI usage with detailed flag descriptions and example command invocations. The documentation will clearly state how the CLI tool interacts with the agentic library when the --agentic flag is used, and provide troubleshooting tips if commands do not behave as expected.

This feature keeps the changes confined to the allowed files and enhances the clarity and functionality of the CLI tool in line with the repository mission.
