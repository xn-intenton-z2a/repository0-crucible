# USER_ASSISTANCE

## Overview
This feature merges and refines the capabilities of intelligent command suggestion and enhanced verbose logging. It combines the error correction from the SUGGESTIONS feature and the visual, color-coded output enhancements from the SELF_ASSISTANCE feature. The unified USER_ASSISTANCE feature delivers improved guidance for users, offering suggestions for mistyped commands as well as clear, context-aware feedback during self-refinement and help-seeking routines.

## Implementation Details
1. **Enhanced Error Handling and Suggestions:**
   - Integrate logic to detect near-miss command inputs using simple string comparison or Levenshtein distance.
   - If a user inputs an unrecognized command that closely matches a valid flag, append a suggestion (e.g. "Did you mean '--help'?") to the error message.
   - Ensure that suggestions trigger only when the similarity score meets a reasonable threshold.

2. **Verbose Logging with Color-Coded Output:**
   - Import the `chalk` library in `src/lib/main.js` and check for a `--verbose` flag at runtime.
   - When activated, log key messages from self-refinement and help-seeking routines with color-coded formatting (for example, green for standard messages and red for errors).
   - Modify functions such as `selfRefine()` and `helpSeeking()` to conditionally apply chalk formatting when `globalThis.verboseMode` is active.

3. **Centralized User Assistance Routine:**
   - Combine the adjustments from both previous features into a single user assistance handling block to avoid redundancy.
   - Ensure that the feature remains non-intrusive when either the error suggestion or verbose modes are not in use.
   - Maintain backward compatibility with existing CLI operations and error handling mechanisms.

## Testing
1. **Unit Tests:**
   - Update tests in `tests/unit/main.test.js` to simulate inputs with slight typos (e.g. "--hlp" instead of "--help") and verify that the suggestion message appears.
   - Test CLI invocations with the `--verbose` flag to ensure that log messages include the correct ANSI color codes.
   - Confirm that both functionalities can operate concurrently without interfering with one another.

2. **Regression Tests:**
   - Ensure that the updated error messages maintain the base structure and merely append useful suggestions where applicable.
   - Verify that the verbose output only activates when explicitly requested.

## Documentation
1. **README Updates:**
   - Update the CLI Options section to note that unrecognized commands now trigger suggestions to correct minor typos.
   - Provide usage examples demonstrating both normal and `--verbose` modes:
     ```bash
     node src/lib/main.js --hlp
     # Output: Error: '--hlp' is not recognized. Did you mean '--help'?

     node src/lib/main.js --verbose --self-refine
     # Output: [Color-coded message] Performing self-refinement analysis...
     ```

2. **User Guidance:**
   - Clearly document in the help system that the USER_ASSISTANCE feature provides additional output clarity and guidance.

## Long-Term Direction
This consolidated feature lays the groundwork for future enhancements such as dynamic natural language processing for context-aware corrections and a more adaptive, self-improving user assistance system. As the project evolves, USER_ASSISTANCE may incorporate more sophisticated models to predict user intent and offer even more targeted feedback.
