# CLI_INTERFACE Feature

## Overview
This feature introduces a unified command line interface that serves as the central entry point for the repository. It is responsible for parsing CLI arguments, dispatching commands, and coordinating with the existing features (LOGGING and SCHEMA_DIFF) to provide a cohesive user experience. The CLI interface will enforce consistency in command usage and help reduce duplication across the codebase.

## Functionality
- **Unified Argument Parsing**:
  - Parses and validates command line arguments for multiple commands (e.g., --help, --diagnostics, --serve, --refresh, --merge-persist, --explain).
  - Provides an organized way to display help documentation and usage instructions.

- **Command Dispatching**:
  - Routes the parsed CLI inputs to the appropriate modules, such as invoking diff operations for the SCHEMA_DIFF feature and logging actions through the LOGGING feature.
  - Simplifies the entry point in the main module by delegating responsibility to a dedicated CLI handler.

- **Integration and Logging**:
  - Integrates with the centralized Logging feature to capture CLI events and errors, ensuring that each command execution is traceable.
  - Coordinates with the Schema Diff functionality to trigger interactive modes, diagnostics, and report generation.

- **Extensibility and Testing**:
  - Architect the CLI so it can be easily extended with new commands or flags in the future without significant refactoring.
  - Include comprehensive unit tests to validate command routing, error handling, and integration with other repository features.

## Implementation
- **Module Creation**:
  - Develop a new module at `src/lib/cliInterface.js` that encapsulates the logic for CLI parsing and command dispatching.
  - Refactor `src/lib/main.js` to import and use the CLI interface module.

- **Documentation & Usage Examples**:
  - Update README.md with detailed instructions on CLI usage along with examples for each command.
  - Enhance CONTRIBUTING.md to include guidelines on how to extend the CLI interface with additional commands or features.

## Value Proposition
The CLI_INTERFACE feature simplifies the overall interaction with the repository by providing a central, maintainable, and extensible command line interface. By consolidating argument parsing and command routing, this feature ensures a consistent user experience, improves logging and error management, and lays a scalable foundation for future enhancements. This directly supports our mission of simplifying API evolution and aiding developers with clear, actionable insights and interactions.
