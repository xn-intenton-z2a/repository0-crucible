# CLI_INTERFACE Feature Enhancement

## Overview
This update enhances the existing CLI_INTERFACE feature by introducing an interactive guided mode aimed at improving the overall command-line user experience. Building on the current unified argument parsing, command dispatching, and auto-completion, this enhancement offers context-sensitive guidance, real‚Äêtime feedback, and intuitive troubleshooting support.

## Functionality
- **Unified Argument Parsing & Dispatching**:
  - Continues to parse and validate CLI arguments for commands such as --help, --diagnostics, --serve, --refresh, --merge-persist, and --explain.
  - Displays organized help documentation and usage instructions.

- **Interactive Guided Mode**:
  - Implements an interactive, step-by-step walkthrough for multi-stage operations, helping users navigate complex commands.
  - Offers context-sensitive prompts based on previous inputs and current command context, reducing common errors.
  - Provides real-time, tutorial-like tips to guide users through tasks like schema diff analysis and AI explanation handling.

- **Enhanced Auto-Completion & Dynamic Suggestions**:
  - Augments existing auto-completion functionality with guidance for next steps and additional command context.
  - Dynamically adjusts suggestions in an interactive session to streamline user input.

- **Integration with Centralized Logging**:
  - Leverages the centralized Logging feature to capture interactive session events, errors, and user navigation paths.
  - Facilitates real-time debugging and logging for improved troubleshooting during guided sessions.

- **Testing & Documentation**:
  - Expands unit tests to ensure both interactive mode and enhanced auto-completion operate seamlessly.
  - Updates README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md with usage examples, detailed instructions, and configuration guidelines for the new mode.

## Implementation
- **Module Updates**:
  - Enhance `src/lib/cliInterface.js` to incorporate interactive guided mode features.
  - Introduce a new helper module, `src/lib/cliGuided.js`, to manage interactive sessions and context-based suggestions.
  - Adjust the main entry point (`src/lib/main.js`) to recognize a new flag (e.g., `--guide`) that activates the interactive mode.

- **Documentation & Usage Examples**:
  - Provide clear examples of interactive guided sessions in documentation.
  - Include inline comments and API documentation outlining the new interactive functions.

## Value Proposition
By integrating an interactive guided mode into the CLI_INTERFACE, this feature reduces the learning curve for new users and enhances productivity for experienced users. It delivers a more intuitive CLI experience by providing context-aware assistance and real-time feedback, directly aligning with the mission to simplify API evolution and foster efficient developer collaboration.
