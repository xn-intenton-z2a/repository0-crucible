# Ontology Feature Enhancement

## Overview
This update refines the existing ontology management functionality by fully implementing the refresh and merge-persist operations. The new update adds two commands, `--refresh` and `--merge-persist`, to dynamically update the OWL ontologies using public data sources and merge them with persisted ontology data. This change enhances the tool's ability to manage and transform live ontology data in line with our mission.

## Implementation Details
- **CLI Argument Parsing:**
  - Update `src/lib/main.js` to detect the new flags `--refresh` and `--merge-persist`.
  - When the `--refresh` flag is provided, call a new function `refreshOntology(args)` that simulates fetching and rebuilding the OWL ontology from live public data.
  - When the `--merge-persist` flag is provided, invoke a new function `mergePersistOntology(args)` that simulates merging newly fetched ontology data with previously persisted data using a merging strategy (e.g., lodash's merge).

- **Source Code Changes:**
  - In `src/lib/main.js`, implement the functions `refreshOntology(args)` and `mergePersistOntology(args)`.
  - For `refreshOntology(args)`:
    - Simulate crawling data (similar to the existing `crawlData` functionality).
    - Generate a dummy refreshed OWL ontology and output the result in JSON format.
    - Include error handling for potential data fetching issues.
  - For `mergePersistOntology(args)`:
    - Simulate reading an in-memory persisted ontology.
    - Merge it with new ontology data, validate the merged ontology using the existing Zod schema, and output the merged result.

- **Testing Enhancements:**
  - Update `tests/unit/main.test.js` to include new unit tests:
    - A test case for `--refresh` to verify that the refreshed ontology is logged as valid JSON and contains expected properties.
    - A test case for `--merge-persist` to check that merging returns a valid ontology structure.

- **Documentation Updates:**
  - Update `README.md` to document the new `--refresh` and `--merge-persist` commands, including usage examples.
  - Update `CONTRIBUTING.md` to include guidelines for extending and testing these new ontology functionalities.

## Future Considerations
- Improve the data crawling mechanism to fetch real-world ontology data.
- Enhance the merging strategy to handle conflicts and versioning between ontology updates.
- Transition the in-memory simulation to persistent file operations if necessary.
