# ONTOLOGY Feature Enhancement

## Overview
This enhancement extends the existing ontology management functionality by implementing two new commands: --refresh and --merge-persist. These commands empower users to dynamically update their OWL ontologies by fetching new data from public sources and merging it with previously persisted ontology data. This update is in alignment with our mission to provide dynamic data transformation and management for OWL ontologies in a self-evolving CLI tool.

## Implementation Details
- **CLI Argument Parsing:**
  - Update the parser in `src/lib/main.js` to detect the `--refresh` and `--merge-persist` flags.
  - When the `--refresh` flag is present, call the new function `refreshOntology(args)`.
  - When the `--merge-persist` flag is present, call the new function `mergePersistOntology(args)`.

- **New Functionality in Source Code (`src/lib/main.js`):
  - Implement `refreshOntology(args)`:
    - Simulate crawling data from public sources (reusing functionality similar to `crawlData` but tailored for ontology refresh).
    - Generate a new dummy OWL ontology (similar to `generateCapitalCitiesOwl`) and log the refreshed data.
    - Include error handling to catch failures during data fetching.

  - Implement `mergePersistOntology(args)`:
    - Simulate reading an existing persisted ontology (in-memory simulation as file operations are not in scope).
    - Merge the new ontology data with the persisted data using a merging strategy (for example, leveraging lodash's merge capabilities).
    - Validate the merged ontology using the existing Zod schema (`ontologySchema`).
    - Log the merged and validated ontology or any error encountered during the process.

- **Testing:**
  - Update tests in `tests/unit/main.test.js` to add new test cases:
    - A test case for `--refresh` that verifies that invoking the refresh command logs a proper refreshed ontology message.
    - A test case for `--merge-persist` that checks the log output for a merged ontology containing the expected properties (`type` and `capitals`).

- **Documentation:**
  - Update `README.md` to include usage instructions and examples for the new flags:
    - Example: `node src/lib/main.js --refresh` to trigger a data refresh operation on the ontology.
    - Example: `node src/lib/main.js --merge-persist` to merge new ontology data with persisted data.
  - Update `CONTRIBUTING.md` to include guidelines for extending and testing the ontology refresh and merge functionality.

## Future Considerations
- Evolve the data merging strategy to include conflict resolution and versioning.
- Transition from in-memory simulation to actual file-based persistence when required.
- Extend the functionality to allow configuration of data sources for more flexible ontology updates.
