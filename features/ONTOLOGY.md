# ONTOLOGY Feature

## Overview
This feature merges multiple aspects of ontology management into a single cohesive experience. It handles generating an OWL ontology (e.g., via the `--capital-cities` flag), validating the ontology JSON against a Zod schema using the `--validate` flag, and extends its functionality with additional commands for refreshing data and persisting changes. This aligns with our mission by ensuring dynamic, consistent, and maintainable OWL ontologies from public data sources.

## Implementation Details
- **CLI Integration:**
  - Enhance the main CLI parser in `src/lib/main.js` to recognize the following flags:
    - `--capital-cities`: Generate a sample OWL ontology using public data of capital cities.
    - `--validate`: Validate the ontology JSON against a predefined Zod schema.
    - `--build-intermediate` and `--build-enhanced`: Additional processing steps for generating ontologies with varying complexity levels.
    - `--refresh`: Trigger data refresh from public sources and regenerate the ontology.
    - `--merge-persist`: Merge new ontology data with persisted JSON data and save the updated ontology.

- **Ontology Generation & Transformation:**
  - Utilize existing library functions to transform public data into a compliant OWL ontology JSON structure.
  - Leverage the Zod schema for validation to ensure that generated ontologies contain essential properties such as ontology ID, classes, relationships, etc.

- **Error Handling:**
  - Provide clear, diagnostic messages if data fetching, transformation, or merging operations fail.
  - Ensure that validation errors are detailed and actionable, helping users and developers diagnose issues quickly.

## Testing
- Develop and update unit tests in the `tests/unit` directory to cover:
  - CLI flag recognition and proper execution paths for each new flag.
  - Verification that the generated OWL ontology JSON and its validation output meet expected standards.
  - Simulated scenarios for refreshing data and merging persisted ontology content.
  - Edge cases and error handling, ensuring robustness when operations fail.

## Documentation
- Update the README file to include usage examples and detailed instructions for:
  - Generating the ontology using `--capital-cities`.
  - Validating the ontology with `--validate`.
  - Processing intermediate and enhanced builds using `--build-intermediate` and `--build-enhanced`.
  - Refreshing data sources with `--refresh` and merging/persisting data with `--merge-persist`.
  
## Future Considerations
- Explore extending the validation process with automated post-generation checks.
- Consider integrating additional data sources and filters for enhanced ontology generation.
- Investigate improvements in persistence mechanisms to handle large or incremental updates efficiently.
