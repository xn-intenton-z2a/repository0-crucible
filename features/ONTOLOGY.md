# ONTOLOGY Feature

## Overview
This feature merges the functionality of generating an OWL ontology (previously handled by the CAPITAL_CITIES feature) and validating the ontology JSON against a Zod schema (previously handled by the SCHEMA_VALIDATION feature). Users can generate a sample OWL ontology using the `--capital-cities` flag and optionally validate the generated JSON by invoking the `--validate` flag. This consolidated functionality aligns with our mission of providing dynamic, consistent OWL ontologies from public data sources.

## Implementation Details
- **CLI Integration:**
  - Update the main CLI parser to recognize both the `--capital-cities` and `--validate` flags.
  - When the `--capital-cities` flag is used, fetch public data for capital cities and generate a sample OWL ontology in JSON format.
  - When the `--validate` flag is provided (either alone or alongside `--capital-cities`), validate the generated (or a supplied) OWL ontology JSON using a predefined Zod schema.

- **Ontology Transformation:**
  - Leverage existing library functions to transform the capital cities public data into a compliant OWL ontology JSON structure.
  - Define and use a Zod schema that captures key properties (ontology ID, classes, relationships, etc.) to verify the structure.

- **Error Handling:**
  - Provide clear diagnostic messages if data fetching or transformation fails.
  - Produce detailed validation errors if the ontology JSON does not meet schema requirements.

## Testing
- Update unit tests in the `tests/unit` directory to simulate both CLI flags:
  - Verify that the `--capital-cities` flag produces the expected OWL ontology JSON output.
  - Validate that invoking the `--validate` flag causes the generated JSON to be checked against the schema, and appropriate messages are returned for valid and invalid data sets.
  - Test combinations of the flags to ensure integrated behavior.

## Documentation
- Update the README file to document the new merged ONTOLOGY feature, including usage examples:
  - Usage with `--capital-cities` to generate the sample ontology.
  - Usage with `--validate` to validate the ontology output.
  - Combined usage instructions.

## Future Considerations
- Enhance the feature by exposing additional filters and multiple data sources for ontology generation.
- Consider integrating automated post-generation validation to improve reliability and resilience of the ontology building workflow.
