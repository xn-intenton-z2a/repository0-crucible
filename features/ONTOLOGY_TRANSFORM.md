# ONTOLOGY_TRANSFORM Feature Specification

## Overview
This feature introduces a new CLI option (`--ontology-transform`) that simulates transforming raw JSON input data into an OWL ontology formatted as JSON. This demonstration aligns with the mission of owl-builder by showcasing the transformation capabilities from open public data into a structured ontology format.

## Changes
- **Source Code (`src/lib/main.js`):**
  - Update the CLI argument parser to detect the `--ontology-transform` flag.
  - When the flag is present, either accept a dummy JSON input or use a predefined sample, and output a transformed JSON object with an `ontology` key containing the simulated OWL structure.

- **Test Suite (`tests/unit/main.test.js`):**
  - Add a new test case that invokes the CLI with the `--ontology-transform` flag and asserts that the output JSON includes an `ontology` key with expected dummy data.

- **Documentation (`README.md`):**
  - Update the usage section to include instructions on how to invoke the new flag, along with example commands and expected output.

- **Dependencies:**
  - No additional dependencies are introduced. The feature builds upon existing modules and libraries.

## Testing
- **Unit Testing:** A new test will call the CLI with `--ontology-transform` and verify that the output JSON contains an `ontology` key. 
- **Manual Testing:** Running `node src/lib/main.js --ontology-transform` should display a JSON output simulating the transformation result.

## Documentation
- The README will detail the new CLI option, provide sample commands, and explain the simulation of transforming JSON input into an OWL ontology.

This feature adheres to the guidelines in CONTRIBUTING.md, supports the mission of owl-builder by demonstrating a key data transformation capability, and is designed to be achievable within a single repository.
