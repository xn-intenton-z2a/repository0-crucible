# HTTP_SERVER Feature

## Overview
This feature adds a lightweight HTTP server to the repository. It provides an HTTP API for serving JSON Schema diff reports and diagnostic information. With the HTTP_SERVER, users can easily access a web-based interface to view diff reports, access interactive diagnostics, and trigger CLI commands remotely. This server complements the existing CLI Parser and SCHEMA_DIFF modules by exposing their outputs over HTTP.

## Functionality
- **Serve Diff Reports**: Offer an endpoint (e.g., `/report`) that serves Markdown or JSON formatted diff reports generated by the SCHEMA_DIFF module.
- **Real-Time Diagnostics**: Provide endpoints such as `/diagnostics` to access current system and runtime information, including health checks and environment details.
- **Remote CLI Interaction**: Allow triggering of certain CLI commands (like refresh or merge-persist) via authenticated HTTP requests.
- **Configuration & Portability**: Support configuration via environment variables (e.g., PORT) and ensure compatibility with Node 20.

## Implementation
- **Module Creation**: Create a new source file `src/lib/httpServer.js` that sets up an HTTP server using Nodeâ€™s built-in HTTP modules or a lightweight framework.
- **Routing & Endpoints**: Define routes for `/report`, `/diagnostics`, and other commands. Ensure proper error handling and validate incoming requests.
- **Integration**: Integrate with existing modules by importing diff report generation from SCHEMA_DIFF and reuse diagnostics outputs. Ensure secure and stateless interactions.
- **Testing**: Develop unit tests (e.g., in `tests/unit/httpServer.test.js`) to cover endpoint responses, error paths, and integration with underlying modules.

## Documentation & Value Proposition
- **User Guidance**: Update README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md to include instructions on using HTTP endpoints, configuration requirements, and usage examples.
- **Value**: The HTTP_SERVER feature provides a significant value-add by enabling remote access to key functionalities from the CLI tool. It aligns with our mission to simplify API evolution and provides a coherent bridge between CLI interactions and web-based reporting.

## Summary
The HTTP_SERVER feature empowers users with a web-accessible interface to view diffs, diagnostics, and execute remote commands, thereby enhancing accessibility and collaboration in the API evolution process.
