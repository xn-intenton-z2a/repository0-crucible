# SCHEMA_WATCHER

## Overview
The SCHEMA_WATCHER feature provides a live file monitoring mechanism that continuously observes designated directories for changes to JSON schema files. Once a change is detected, it automatically triggers diff generation, linting checks, auto-fix procedures, and risk assessments. This real-time automation empowers developers to instantly see the impact of updates, ensuring a seamless and proactive schema evolution process.

## Functionality
- **Live Monitoring:** Utilizes Node.js built-in file system watch capabilities to monitor schema directories for file modifications, additions, or deletions.
- **Automated Diff & Linting:** On detecting changes, the watcher triggers the SCHEMA_MANAGER routines to generate comprehensive diffs and run advanced lint validations, including auto-fix operations where applicable.
- **Risk Analysis Integration:** Automatically invokes the risk assessment engine to analyze the impact of changes and provide immediate actionable insights.
- **CLI & Optional HTTP Endpoint:** Offers a CLI flag (e.g., `--watch`) to start monitoring in the terminal. Optionally, an HTTP endpoint can be provided for remote triggering and status reporting.
- **Logging & Notifications:** Records change events and diff summaries locally, aiding in historical audit and troubleshooting.

## Implementation & Testing
- **Single-File Implementation:** The functionality can be encapsulated in a single source file (e.g., `src/lib/schema_watcher.js`), integrating with existing SCHEMA_MANAGER routines.
- **Configuration:** Allows customization via environment variables and CLI arguments, ensuring flexibility in target directories and monitoring intervals.
- **Testing Strategy:** Comprehensive unit and integration tests will simulate file system changes, verifying event triggers, diff generation, linting outputs, and risk assessments. Tests will cover both standard and edge-case scenarios to ensure robustness.

## Value Proposition
The SCHEMA_WATCHER feature extends the repository's mission by adding continuous, real-time monitoring of JSON schemas. It enhances developer productivity through immediate feedback on schema changes and ensures operational transparency by automatically linking updates to diff and risk analysis reports.
