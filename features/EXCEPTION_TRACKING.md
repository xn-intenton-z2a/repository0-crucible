# EXCEPTION_TRACKING

## Overview
This feature enhances the CLI agent's robustness by capturing unhandled exceptions and integrating detailed error tracking into the CLI workflow. When an exception occurs (for example, in a command action), the agent will intercept the error, log a formatted error message with a stack trace to the in-memory log, and provide user-friendly output. This enables better diagnostics and facilitates help-seeking behavior when unexpected errors occur.

## Implementation Details
- **Source File Update (src/lib/main.js):**
  - Wrap the main execution flow in a try/catch block to intercept any unhandled exceptions.
  - In the catch block, capture the error message and stack trace and append these details to the memory log along with a timestamp.
  - Log a formatted error message to the console that advises the user to run in help-seeking mode if persistent issues occur.
  - Integrate a command-line flag (e.g., `--track-exceptions`) that, when used, enables enhanced exception tracking. This flag can also trigger additional logging output for diagnostics.

- **Test File Update (tests/unit/main.test.js):**
  - Add unit tests to simulate exceptions thrown during command processing to ensure that error details (message and stack trace) are correctly appended to the memory log.
  - Verify that the exception tracking output includes expected patterns (e.g., presence of the error message, stack trace text, and a user help advisory).

- **README Update (README.md):**
  - Update usage documentation to include the new `--track-exceptions` flag.
  - Provide an example command:
    ```bash
    node src/lib/main.js --track-exceptions
    ```
  - Explain that with this flag, any unexpected errors will be captured, logged with detailed diagnostics, and users will receive guidance to seek help.

## Future Considerations
- Enhance the exception tracking to automatically persist error logs to an external monitoring tool or a file (integrating with LOG_PERSISTENCE).
- Extend the error handler to trigger a help-seeking mechanism or create alerts (e.g., open an issue in GitHub) when repeated failures occur.
- Improve integration with self-improvement by analyzing error patterns over time and suggesting fixes or refactors.
