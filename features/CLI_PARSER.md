# CLI PARSER Feature Enhancement

## Overview
This update enhances the existing CLI Parser functionality by adding an integrated file watcher mode. In addition to robust CLI argument parsing, contextual help, error handling, and command dispatching, the updated CLI Parser now supports an auto-watch feature. This allows the tool to monitor JSON Schema files for changes and automatically trigger schema diff operations. This integration further streamlines the workflow for API developers, aligning with our mission of simplifying API evolution.

## Functionality
- **Centralized Parsing**: Continue to validate and process CLI flags and commands in a unified module.
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Provide clear errors and suggestions for invalid or conflicting options.
- **File Watcher Mode**:
  - Introduce a `--watch` flag to enable file monitoring.
  - Monitor JSON Schema files for changes using Node's file system monitoring capabilities.
  - Automatically trigger the SCHEMA_DIFF process upon detecting updates, ensuring real-time diff updates.
- **Integration with Existing Features**:
  - Seamlessly coordinate with the SCHEMA_DIFF feature to re-run diff operations when changes occur.
  - Maintain compatibility with the HTTP_SERVER for remote diagnostics and report serving.

## Implementation
- **Module Updates**:
  - Update `src/lib/cliParser.js` to incorporate file watching logic using Nodeâ€™s `fs.watch` or similar APIs.
  - Refactor command dispatching in `src/lib/main.js` to handle the new `--watch` flag and automate diff operations.
- **Testing**:
  - Add unit tests (e.g., in `tests/unit/cliParser.test.js`) to cover the file watcher functionality under various file change scenarios.
  - Validate that triggering the file watcher correctly initiates the SCHEMA_DIFF operations as expected.
- **Documentation & User Guidance**:
  - Update README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md with usage examples for the `--watch` flag.
  - Provide inline code comments and detailed configuration instructions for enabling and using file watcher mode.

## Value Proposition
By integrating file watching directly into the CLI Parser, users can achieve an automated, real-time development workflow. Developers benefit from immediate feedback when JSON Schema files change, reducing manual intervention and improving productivity. This feature strengthens our tool's position as the go-to solution for streamlined API evolution and collaboration.
