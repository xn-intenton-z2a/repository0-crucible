# CLI Parser Feature

## Overview
This feature introduces a robust command-line argument parser that centralizes and standardizes the processing of CLI flags and commands across the repository. By creating a dedicated CLI parsing module, we enhance user experience, improve error handling, and streamline integration of future flags. This update also merges the CLI-related logic from the MERGE_PERSIST feature into the SCHEMA_DIFF feature, thereby consolidating diff, interactive, diagnostics, refresh, and merge-persist functionalities.

## Functionality
- **Centralized Parsing**: Develop a CLI Parser module (e.g., `src/lib/cliParser.js`) to handle all command-line inputs. This module will validate flags, provide contextual help messages, and dispatch commands internally.
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Provide clear feedback for invalid or conflicting options. This includes suggestions for correct usage and detailed error messages.
- **Integration with Existing Features**:
  - **SCHEMA_DIFF**: The parser will seamlessly integrate with the merged diff functionality (including interactive mode, diagnostics, refresh, and merge-persist) to route commands accordingly.
  - **MARKDOWN_REPORT**: Ensure the `--report` flag is processed and routed to the report generation logic.

## Implementation
- **Module Creation**: Create a new file `src/lib/cliParser.js` that exports functions to parse and validate CLI arguments.
- **Main File Update**: Refactor `src/lib/main.js` to use the new CLI Parser module, reducing redundant parsing logic and improving maintainability.
- **Testing**: Add unit tests in `tests/unit/cliParser.test.js` to cover a variety of input scenarios and validate proper error messaging and command dispatching.

## Documentation & User Guidance
- Update README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, and inline code comments to reflect the new CLI structure and provide usage examples (e.g., `node src/lib/main.js --help`).
- Ensure that the documentation clearly explains how the CLI Parser interacts with other features, particularly the merged SCHEMA_DIFF functionality.

## Value Proposition
This CLI Parser feature enhances the overall usability of the tool by providing a clear, maintainable, and robust command-line interface. This aligns with the mission of simplifying API evolution and facilitating enhanced developer collaboration through better tooling and error handling.
