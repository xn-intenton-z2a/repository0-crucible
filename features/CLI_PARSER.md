# CLI_PARSER Feature Specification

## Overview
This feature enhances the command line interface in the main source file to parse and handle CLI flags. It introduces a simple argument parser into src/lib/main.js that recognizes flags (for example --help, --agentic, --version, --dry-run, --diagnostics, etc) and prints appropriate usage instructions or diagnostics. This change aligns the tool with the mission of providing a versatile CLI for creating and managing OWL ontologies.

## Implementation
The main file will be updated to include logic for parsing process.argv. A function will map known flags to behaviors. If the user passes --help, a help message listing available commands and their purpose will be output. For other flags like --agentic and --dry-run, the function will log the intended action. All new behaviors are consolidated in one source file to keep changes minimal.

## Testing
Unit tests in tests/unit/main.test.js will be updated to simulate running the CLI with various flags and verify correct responses. For the --help flag, the output should include the usage instructions. For other flags, the tests will confirm that appropriate log messages appear without application errors.

## Documentation
The README.md will be updated to include usage examples and explanations for the new CLI flags. It will document behavior for --help and the other supported flags. This documentation ensures users can understand and benefit from the enhanced CLI capabilities.

## Dependencies
No additional dependencies will be required. The implementation relies on native Node.js functionality to parse command line arguments.
