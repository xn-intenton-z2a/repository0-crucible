# PERFORMANCE_MONITOR

This feature introduces performance monitoring for the core ontology operations. It aggregates runtime metrics such as response times, error rates, and operation frequencies for key endpoints and CLI commands. The aggregated performance data is exposed through an HTTP endpoint, making it easier for developers and operators to understand and troubleshoot performance issues.

## Overview

- **Metric Collection:**
  - Instrument major ontology operations (build, refresh, query, persist, crawl, merge).
  - Record response times, success/error counts, and frequency of calls.
  - Use in-memory counters or lightweight log collectors to aggregate data over a configurable time window.

- **HTTP API Endpoint:**
  - Add a new endpoint (e.g. GET /performance) that returns a JSON summary of performance metrics.
  - The output includes average response times, total calls, error counts, and optionally, historical trends if needed.

- **CLI Integration:**
  - Support a CLI flag (e.g. --performance-stats) to print the latest performance summary to the console.
  - Allow optional configuration of aggregation intervals through environment variables.

## Implementation Details

- **Instrumentation:** Insert timers in existing functions (e.g. buildOntologyFromLiveData, persistOntology, queryOntology, crawlOntologies) to capture the start and end times of operations. 

- **Aggregation:** Maintain a simple in-memory structure (e.g., a JavaScript object) that tracks metrics per operation. 

- **Endpoint and CLI:** Integrate the aggregation data with the HTTP server started by the CLI. On a GET request to `/performance`, return a well-structured JSON object containing metrics.

- **Configuration:** Allow tuning of the aggregation reporting interval via environment variables (for example, PERFORMANCE_INTERVAL).

## Benefits and User Impact

- **Proactive Monitoring:** Provide real-time insights into the performance of ontology operations with minimal overhead.
- **Enhanced Troubleshooting:** Quickly identify slow or error-prone operations and take corrective actions.
- **Operational Transparency:** Equip administrators and developers with clear performance data to optimize and debug system behavior.
- **Seamless Integration:** Leverage the existing single-repository architecture of owl-builder, ensuring all additional code is contained within the library and CLI tool.
