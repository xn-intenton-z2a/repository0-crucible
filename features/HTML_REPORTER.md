# HTML_REPORTER Feature

## Overview

The HTML_REPORTER feature delivers an interactive, browser-friendly report generation tool for JSON schema diffs and validations. Building on the existing Markdown reporting, this feature introduces a visually driven, filterable HTML report that enhances the clarity of schema changes and supports audit trails, making it easier for developers and teams to review and collaborate on API evolution.

## Functionality

- **Interactive Web Reports:** Generate dynamic HTML reports with collapsible sections and real-time filtering options, allowing users to easily navigate through complex schema changes.
- **Visual Diff Representation:** Present schema differences side-by-side with color-coded highlights to clearly indicate additions, removals, and modifications.
- **Seamless Integration:** Ingest output data from the SCHEMA_TOOL feature, including AI-powered explanations and historical logs, for a unified reporting experience.
- **Export & Archive Options:** Allow users to export the generated HTML reports and maintain versioned archives for compliance and auditing purposes.
- **Configurable Output:** Provide command-line flags (e.g., --html-report, --report-theme) to customize report appearance, template selections, and output directories.

## Implementation

- **Single Source File:** Develop in a dedicated file (e.g., `src/lib/htmlReporter.js`) that handles reading JSON diff data, rendering HTML using template literals or a lightweight templating engine, and writing the final output.
- **CLI Integration:** Extend the main CLI tool to recognize the `--html-report` flag, which triggers HTML report generation.
- **Testing & Documentation:** Add unit tests to ensure accurate HTML rendering and validation. Update the README and CONTRIBUTING documentation with usage examples and configuration details.

## Value Proposition

The HTML_REPORTER feature provides a compelling, visually enriched reporting layer that facilitates better understanding of JSON schema evolutions. By delivering an interactive, exportable HTML report, it enhances collaboration among API developers and streamlines troubleshootingâ€”a direct support to our mission of simplifying API evolution and fostering effective teamwork.
