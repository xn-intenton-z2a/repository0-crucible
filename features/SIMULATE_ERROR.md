# SIMULATE_ERROR Feature Specification

## Overview
This feature adds a simulated error mode to the CLI tool via a new flag (--simulate-error). When the flag is provided, the tool will deliberately trigger an error scenario and output a formatted error message. This helps developers test error handling, logging, and diagnostic workflows without requiring an actual failure in the application logic.

## Implementation
The following updates will be made:

- In the src/lib/main.js file:
  - Add "--simulate-error" to the supported flags list.
  - Check for the presence of the flag before other processing. If present, output a simulated error message (using console.error) and exit the execution early.

- In the tests/unit/main.test.js file:
  - Add a new test case to simulate error mode by passing the "--simulate-error" flag and verify that the error message is displayed. This test ensures that the CLI terminates with a proper error message instead of proceeding with normal command processing.

- In the README.md and docs/USAGE.md files:
  - Update the CLI usage documentation to include the new "--simulate-error" flag, explaining its purpose for testing error scenarios.

## Testing
The unit tests will be updated to simulate the following scenario:

- Passing the "--simulate-error" flag should trigger the error simulation and output a message confirming the simulated error.

This enhancement is aligned with the repository mission to provide clear troubleshooting and diagnostic tools within the CLI, making error conditions reproducible and easier to debug.
