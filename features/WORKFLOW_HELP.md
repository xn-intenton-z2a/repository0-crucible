# WORKFLOW_HELP Feature

This feature adds a new command-line option `--workflow` that provides users with a quick reference guide on GitHub Actions and workflow configuration directly from the CLI tool. When the user runs `node src/lib/main.js --workflow`, the tool will output a summary of GitHub Actions best practices, common triggers, and configuration steps that are useful for CI/CD integration.

## Overview

- **Purpose**: To offer immediate help and guidelines for setting up GitHub Actions workflows, as documented in the library guides. This aligns with the mission of agentic automation by providing users with actionable tips right from the command line.
- **Usage**: The feature is invoked via the `--workflow` flag. If detected in the CLI arguments, the program prints the workflow guidance and exits without processing other commands.

## Implementation Details

- **Source File Changes (src/lib/main.js)**: 
  - Update the `main` function to check if `--workflow` is included in the passed arguments.
  - If present, output the workflow help content (including key GitHub Actions elements such as trigger events, job definitions, and caching strategies) and exit.

- **Test File Changes (tests/unit/main.test.js)**:
  - Add tests to ensure that when `--workflow` is passed as an argument, the expected help text is output. This ensures that the CLI behaves as expected and provides users with accurate guidance.

- **README File Changes**:
  - Update the Usage section to document the new `--workflow` option. Include examples of how to run the command and a brief description of the output provided.

- **Dependencies File**:
  - No new dependencies are required for this feature.

## Expected Benefits

- **Enhanced User Guidance**: Users get immediate context and actionable tips for setting up GitHub Actions.
- **Alignment with Mission**: Provides a stepping stone in agentic automation by integrating CI/CD best practices directly into the CLI.
- **Incremental Improvement**: Acts as a foundation for more interactive or dynamic help features in future iterations.
