# CLI_TOOL Update: Ontology Transform

## Overview
This update enhances the existing CLI tool by implementing two new flags: `--ontology-transform` and `--owl-examples`. These additions enable dynamic transformation of input JSON into an OWL ontology format and the augmentation of output data with an additional demonstration section. The updates adhere to the guidelines in the CONTRIBUTING.md and align with the mission stated in the MISSION.md.

## Implementation Details
### Source File (`src/lib/main.js`)
- **--ontology-transform Flag**:
  - Check if the flag is present.
  - Inspect the argument immediately following the flag.
  - If the argument is valid JSON, transform it into an object with an `ontology` key wrapping the parsed JSON and add a `generatedAt` timestamp.
  - If the JSON is invalid or missing, output a default ontology transformation object with preset content and a timestamp.

- **--owl-examples Flag**:
  - When present, modify the standard output (such as under the `--capital-cities` flag) by appending an additional `results` key containing sample demonstration data.

### Testing Enhancements (`tests/unit/main.test.js`)
- Add new tests to validate the behavior of the `--ontology-transform` flag:
  - Test passing valid JSON input results in an output object with an `ontology` property and proper timestamp.
  - Test that missing or invalid JSON input results in the default transformation object.
- Add new tests to ensure that the `--owl-examples` flag produces an output that includes both the original OWL content and an extra `results` key with demonstration data.

### Documentation Updates (`README.md`)
- Update the CLI usage section to describe the new flags with usage examples:
  - Explain how to use the `--ontology-transform` flag with both valid and invalid JSON inputs.
  - Show the output differences when the `--owl-examples` flag is applied, highlighting the addition of sample data in the result.

### Dependencies Update (`package.json`)
- No additional dependencies are required for these changes. The existing dependencies remain sufficient to support the new functionality.

## Compliance and Impact
- **Backward Compatibility**: The new flag implementations maintain compatibility with existing features and do not interfere with current commands.
- **Testing Coverage**: Enhanced tests ensure that both valid and fallback behaviors are covered; regression tests validate that existing functionality remains unaffected.
- **Mission Alignment**: This update improves the capability of `owl-builder` to transform and augment OWL ontologies from public data sources, fulfilling the mission of providing dynamic ontology management via a CLI tool.

## Roll-out Strategy
- Implement the changes in the source file, update the corresponding tests, and revise the README to capture the new usage details.
- Verify all tests pass using the command `npm test` and confirm functionality via manual testing.
