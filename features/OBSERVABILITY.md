# OBSERVABILITY Feature

## Overview
This feature consolidates the functionalities of diagnostics and logging into a unified observability module. The OBSERVABILITY feature is designed to provide real-time insights, error analysis, and comprehensive log management for all key operations. By merging the DIAGNOSTICS and LOGGING modules, this feature simplifies troubleshooting, enhances performance tracking, and aligns with our mission to simplify API evolution and improve developer collaboration.

## Functionality
- **Unified Real-Time Analysis**: Monitor operational metrics from schema diff, validation operations, and interactive CLI diagnostics in one place.
- **Comprehensive Error & Warning Reports**: Automatically capture errors, warnings, and performance bottlenecks, then present detailed reports with actionable recommendations.
- **Interactive Diagnostics Mode**: A CLI flag (e.g., `--observability`) will trigger a deep-dive analysis, generating both log summaries and diagnostic suggestions.
- **Centralized Logging Engine**: Standardize log events from CLI interactions, HTTP endpoints, and schema diff operations with configurable log levels and output targets (console, file, etc.).
- **AI-Enhanced Suggestions**: Leverage AI to analyze logged events and offer guided remediation steps, minimizing downtime and simplifying debugging.

## Implementation
- **Module Consolidation**: Merge the existing `diagnostics.js` and `logger.js` functionalities into a single source file (e.g., `src/lib/observability.js`).
- **CLI Integration**: Update the main CLI entry point to recognize the `--observability` flag, routing to the combined diagnostics and logging routines.
- **Configuration & Scalability**: Support configuration via environment variables and/or config files to set log levels, output formats, and AI suggestion parameters.
- **Testing & Documentation**: Develop comprehensive unit tests to cover all observability scenarios. Update the README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md with usage instructions, configuration examples, and troubleshooting guidelines.

## Value Proposition
By offering a consolidated observability module, developers have a robust toolkit for real-time analysis and effective troubleshooting. This reduction in complexity improves maintainability and enhances the overall user experience, aligning with our mission to streamline API evolution through simplicity and effective collaboration.
