# Schema Validation Feature

## Overview
This feature introduces a new CLI flag, `--validate`, which triggers a Zod-based validation of generated OWL ontology JSON data against a predefined schema. The validation process ensures that the ontology data complies with the expected structure and rules, in line with our mission to provide reliable and consistent ontology generation.

## Implementation Details
- **CLI Integration:** Update the main CLI parser in `src/lib/main.js` to recognize the `--validate` flag. When this flag is invoked, the application will use a predefined Zod schema to validate a sample or generated OWL ontology JSON. In this context, the validation can run on a dummy ontology output or be integrated into an existing workflow if an ontology is already available.
- **Zod Schema:** Define a Zod schema for the ontology structure. The schema should include key properties (for example, ontology ID, classes, relationships, etc.) and enforce type constraints. This schema will serve as a contract to check if the ontology JSON is correct.
- **Error Handling:** In case the ontology does not conform to the schema, clear error messages should be provided. If validation passes, console output should confirm success.
- **Dependencies:** Leverage the existing `zod` dependency already included in `package.json`.

## Testing
- **Unit Tests:** Add tests in `tests/unit/main.test.js` to simulate the `--validate` invocation. The tests should capture output and verify whether the validation process returns the correct messages for both valid and invalid ontology data.
- **Edge Cases:** Ensure that tests cover scenarios where the input data is missing required fields or contains type mismatches.

## Documentation
- **README Update:** Update `README.md` to include a section on the `--validate` flag. Provide usage examples and explain how this feature helps in ensuring the integrity of generated OWL ontology data.
- **User Guide:** Document how users can integrate and utilize the validation feature as part of their OWL ontology generation workflow.

## Future Considerations
- Consider extending validation to run automatically after ontology generation commands (such as `--capital-cities` or during REST API refresh endpoints).
- Integrate more comprehensive error logging or even automated fixes when minor discrepancies are found during validation.
