# WEB_UI

## Overview

The WEB_UI feature introduces a lightweight, web-based dashboard for owl-builder. This interactive interface provides users with a real-time view of the current ontology, diagnostic summaries, and live notifications. In addition to the existing CLI and REST endpoints, the web UI offers an accessible, visually-driven approach to monitoring and managing ontology operations.

## Features

- **Dynamic Ontology Display:** View the current ontology data in real time with periodic auto-refresh. Users can inspect the live data built from verified public endpoints.
- **Diagnostic Dashboard:** Display aggregated diagnostic logs and telemetry summaries, including environment variable warnings and other operational metrics gathered by the observability module.
- **Live Notifications Panel:** Integrate the existing WebSocket notifications to present instantaneous updates when ontology actions (refresh, merge, update) occur.
- **Interactive Controls:** Provide basic controls to trigger key operations (e.g., refresh, backup, merge) directly through the UI, offering a user-friendly alternative to CLI commands.

## Implementation Details

- The UI will be served under a dedicated endpoint (for example, `/dashboard`) on the existing HTTP server.
- A minimal HTML/CSS/JavaScript interface will be embedded directly in the application. JavaScript will establish a WebSocket connection to receive live notifications.
- Data for the UI (such as the current ontology, diagnostic summaries, and configuration details) will be retrieved from the respective functions in the ontology service and observability components.
- The design will remain simple and responsive, ensuring the feature can be implemented in a single source file with minimal dependencies.

## Benefits

- **Enhanced User Experience:** Provides a visual, user-friendly interface to monitor and manage the system without relying solely on CLI operations.
- **Real-Time Insights:** Instant access to live data and alerts improves situational awareness and troubleshooting efficiency.
- **Accessibility:** Enables non-technical users to interact with and understand the systemâ€™s state, broadening the tool's appeal.
