# STYLING

## Overview
This feature enhances the CLI output by integrating colored and styled text using the Chalk library. With STYLING, the agent's console messages (such as help output, diagnostics, and standard logs) become more visually distinct and user friendly. This improvement aligns with our mission of creating an agent that not only functions effectively but also provides a clear, informative interface.

## Implementation Details
- **Source File Update:**
  - Import the Chalk library in `src/lib/main.js` using either the ES Module syntax: `import chalk from 'chalk';`.
  - Replace plain `console.log` output with styled messages. For example, use `chalk.green('Success message')` for regular output and `chalk.red('Error message')` where appropriate.
  - Ensure that flag-based outputs (like `--help` or `--diagnostics`) are also enhanced with color cues.

- **Test File Update:**
  - In `tests/unit/main.test.js`, add tests to verify that the output includes ANSI escape sequences (indicative of Chalk's styling) when a version of enhanced output is expected.
  - These tests should not break the existing behavior but check for the presence of color codes in the output log.

- **README Update:**
  - Update `README.md` to document the new STYLING feature. Include instructions on how the CLI now renders colored output and benefits for quick identification of statuses (info, error, help, etc.). For example, add a section that shows sample command outputs with color commentary.

- **Dependencies File Update:**
  - Update `package.json` to include the Chalk library as a dependency. This reinforces the use of Chalk for terminal styling. Use an appropriate version that matches compatibility (e.g. "chalk": "^5.0.0").

## Testing & Compatibility
- Run `npm test` to ensure that the ANSI codes appear in the CLI outputs during testing scenarios.
- Ensure that the use of Chalk does not affect non-TTY environments. The implementation should rely on Chalkâ€™s built-in auto-detection to disable styling when needed.

## Long-Term Considerations
Integrating STYLING now lays the groundwork for further enhancements in the CLI user interface. Future iterations may include dynamic theme selection or additional styling modes for different runtime environments.
