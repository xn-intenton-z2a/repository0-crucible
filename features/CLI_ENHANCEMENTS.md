# CLI ENHANCEMENTS

## Overview
This feature consolidates improvements to the CLI user interface by merging colorized output and interactive capabilities into a single, coherent module. The CLI will not only display color-coded messages to enhance readability (errors in red, success messages in green, diagnostics in blue, etc.) but will also include an interactive Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) with auto-completion for available commands and flags.

## Implementation Details
- **Colorized Output:**
  - Import a color library (e.g. Chalk) to apply color coding to console messages. Error messages, success confirmations, diagnostic and informational outputs will be wrapped with appropriate color functions (e.g. chalk.red, chalk.green).
  - Update existing log outputs and CLI flags to consistently apply color formatting.

- **Interactive Mode & Auto-Completion:**
  - Detect a CLI flag (e.g. `--interactive`) and instantiate a readline interface that listens on `process.stdin` and outputs to `process.stdout`.
  - Implement a custom completer function that dynamically suggests command options, flags (such as `--persist-memory`, `--diagnostics`, etc.) and sub-commands based on partial input.
  - Ensure that commands entered in the interactive session are processed with the same logic used in non-interactive mode.

- **Testing and Documentation:**
  - Update tests in the unit test files (e.g. `tests/unit/main.test.js`) to account for auto-completion and the colorized output. Utilize helper functions to strip ANSI escape sequences during tests if needed.
  - Document usage examples in the README, explaining how to launch the interactive mode (e.g. `node src/lib/main.js --interactive`) and how colorized output improves command readability.

## Long-Term Direction
By merging color output with an interactive CLI session, this feature enhances both usability and accessibility of the tool. Future iterations could include configurable themes and dynamic auto-completion based on command history. The unified approach lays the groundwork for a smoother developer experience, aligning with our mission by ensuring that agent actions and diagnostics are immediately accessible and visually intuitive.
