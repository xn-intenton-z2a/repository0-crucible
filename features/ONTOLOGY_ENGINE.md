# Ontology Engine

This feature consolidates the core ontology operations into a single, cohesive module that handles live data integration, interactive model selection, and ontology management functions such as backup, refresh, and merging. It replaces the separate ONTOLOGY_MANAGER and LIVE_DATA features, ensuring a unified interface and improved maintainability.

## Overview

- **Unified Operations:** Combines live data fetching from verified public endpoints with interactive ontology model selection. Users can choose from multiple ontology models (basic, advanced, minimal, complex, scientific, educational, philosophical, economic, and hybrid) using CLI flags while ensuring that live data is incorporated for up-to-date ontology generation.

- **Extended Management Functions:** Integrates backup, refresh, and merge functionalities to provide a streamlined workflow. It automatically falls back to a legacy static ontology as an emergency measure when live data integration is disabled or fails.

- **Interactive CLI and API Integration:** Provides a unified CLI interface that supports model selection, diagnostic integration, and web server endpoints for real-time monitoring. The system logs detailed diagnostics for each operation using the robust logging mechanism defined in the diagnostics feature.

## Implementation Details

- **Live Data Integration:** Utilizes promise-based retry logic with exponential backoff and jitter for fetching ontology data from public APIs. Environment variables and CLI overrides ensure that retry count and initial delays are fully configurable.

- **Interactive Model Selection:** Implements a CLI flag (e.g. `--select-model`) that lists available ontology models. If a model is not specified, the feature prompts the user interactively or falls back to a predefined default model.

- **Backup and Refresh:** Combines functions to persist, backup, refresh, and merge ontologies. This ensures that users always have access to the most current ontology data as well as a backup copy for recovery.

- **Diagnostic Integration:** Continues to leverage the enhanced diagnostics system to log errors, telemetry, and environment variable parsing issues, ensuring robust error handling and user feedback.

## Benefits

- **Consolidation:** Reduces code duplication by merging ontology management and live data integration, leading to better cohesion and maintainability.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** A single module simplifies both CLI and API interactions for ontology operations, improving the user experience.

- **Enhanced Reliability:** Backup, refresh, and merging capabilities ensure that the ontology remains current and resilient to network or data retrieval issues.

- **Configurability:** Environment and CLI overrides allow users to fine-tune system behavior in various deployment scenarios.
