# ONTOLOGY ENGINE

This feature consolidates the dynamic aspects of live data integration, diagnostic telemetry, anomaly detection, and automated rollback into one unified module. It unifies CLI and WebSocket communications, ensuring that ontology building is both resilient and transparent.

## Overview

- **Live Data Integration:** Fetches and processes data from verified public endpoints to build OWL ontologies in real time.
- **Diagnostic and Telemetry Aggregation:** Collects, normalizes, and exports telemetry, including diagnostic logs and environment variable warnings, to facilitate monitoring and troubleshooting.
- **Anomaly Detection and Automated Rollback:** Continuously validates live data against expected schema standards and, upon detecting anomalies, triggers an immediate rollback to the last known good backup.
- **CLI and WebSocket Integration:** Provides robust command line interfaces and real-time notifications to ensure operational transparency.

## Implementation Details

1. **Live Data Processing and Validation:**
   - Fetch live data with robust retry mechanisms and exponential backoff. 
   - Validate critical fields (e.g., ensure the presence and non-emptiness of `entries`) and trigger diagnostic logs if validation fails.

2. **Diagnostic Telemetry Enhancements:**
   - Aggregate warnings from environment variable parsing, leveraging debounced batching to handle high concurrency.
   - Support both JSON and CSV export formats via dedicated CLI commands.

3. **Automated Rollback Mechanism:**
   - On detection of an anomaly (e.g., missing or empty data arrays), log detailed messages and attempt an automated rollback from a backup file.
   - If rollback is successful, restore the last verified ontology and broadcast a WebSocket update.
   - In scenarios where rollback fails, default to a static fallback, ensuring uninterrupted service.

4. **Enhanced Anomaly Detection and Escalation:**
   - Implement an additional monitoring layer that tracks the frequency and patterns of anomalies.
   - If anomalies exceed a configurable threshold within a given timeframe, escalate alerts via CLI notifications and WebSocket broadcasts.
   - Provide detailed diagnostic summaries for rapid investigation and resolution.

5. **CLI and WebSocket Integration:**
   - Update existing CLI commands (e.g., `--detect-anomaly`, `--backup-refresh`) to include new escalation details and diagnostic insights.
   - Ensure WebSocket notifications include fields like updated ontology title, version, timestamp, and a clear status message (e.g., anomaly detected, rollback executed, escalation triggered).

## Benefits

- **Resilient Ontology Building:** Combines real-time live data integration with immediate anomaly remediation, ensuring the ontology remains accurate and up-to-date.
- **Proactive Monitoring:** Enhanced anomaly analysis and escalation allow administrators to quickly address issues before widespread disruption occurs.
- **Operational Transparency:** Through robust CLI and WebSocket updates, users remain continuously informed about system status and interventions.
- **Streamlined Maintenance:** Unifying multiple overlapping services into one cohesive module simplifies code management and future feature enhancements.
