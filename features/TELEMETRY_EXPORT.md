# TELEMETRY_EXPORT

This feature adds a dedicated mechanism for exporting diagnostic and telemetry data generated during live data integration and environment variable parsing. The primary goal is to provide users with a consolidated, structured view of all non-numeric and misconfigured environment variable events along with other diagnostics which can be reviewed or fed into external monitoring systems.

## Overview

- **Aggregated Telemetry Data:** Collect and aggregate telemetry events including non-numeric environment variable fallback warnings. This feature builds on the existing inline logging and caching mechanism used for NaN fallback events.

- **Export Endpoints and CLI Command:**
  - **HTTP Endpoint:** Introduce a new HTTP API endpoint (e.g. GET /telemetry) to return the aggregated telemetry data in JSON format.
  - **CLI Command:** Provide a new CLI flag (e.g. --export-telemetry) to print or save the telemetry summary to a file.

- **Data Formats:** The export may return data in JSON by default, with potential to support CSV for easier integration with external tools.

## Implementation Details

- **Data Aggregation:** Leverage the existing warning cache mechanism used for NaN fallback events. Extend it to capture additional diagnostic metadata if needed.

- **Endpoint Integration:** Add a new HTTP route to the web server that when called returns the current aggregated telemetry summary from the warning cache.

- **CLI Integration:** Add a new CLI option that when invoked, prints the aggregated telemetry summary to stdout or writes it to a specified file.

- **Configuration:** Allow users to optionally configure the export format and threshold through environment variables or CLI parameters.

## Benefits and User Impact

- **Enhanced Observability:** Operators gain deeper insight into configuration issues and environment variable anomalies across deployments.

- **Integration with Monitoring:** Exported telemetry data can be used with other monitoring and alerting systems to proactively identify misconfigurations.

- **Improved Troubleshooting:** Aggregated telemetry summaries enhance the troubleshooting process by providing a historical view of diagnostic warnings.

This feature builds on the mission to deliver robust, live-data driven ontologies by ensuring that detailed diagnostic information is accessible and actionable.
