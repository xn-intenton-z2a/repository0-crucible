# WEB_SERVICE Feature

## Overview
The WEB_SERVICE feature consolidates the remote access and monitoring capabilities into a unified HTTP service. It merges the functionalities provided by the existing HTTP_API and OBSERVABILITY modules into a single, coherent service. This integration allows API developers and teams to interact remotely with JSON Schema diff operations, persistent storage controls, and real‑time operational diagnostics, thereby enhancing collaborative troubleshooting and seamless CI/CD integration.

## Core Functionalities
- **Unified Schema Operations:**
  - Expose endpoints for generating, retrieving, and comparing JSON Schema diffs.
  - Enable operations like persistence, rollback, and audit trail retrieval via RESTful calls.

- **Integrated Observability & Diagnostics:**
  - Provide real-time diagnostics and logging data through dedicated endpoints.
  - Deliver consolidated error and performance reports, complete with AI‑powered remediation suggestions.
  - Support health checks and system performance metrics in an easily accessible format.

- **CLI and Remote Integration:**
  - Allow CLI flags (e.g., `--serve`) to initialize the HTTP server which now also encompasses observability routes.
  - Maintain a single source file module (e.g., `src/lib/web_service.js`) that centralizes all remote interaction logic.

## Implementation & Testing
- **Single-File Module:**
  - Implement the unified HTTP service in one file, integrating routing, error handling, and security practices.
  - Ensure seamless interfacing with SCHEMA_MANAGER for schema operations.

- **Robust Error Handling & Security:**
  - Implement comprehensive error management for both invalid schema operations and diagnostic endpoints.
  - Integrate input validation and basic security configurations.

- **Documentation & Testing:**
  - Update the project README and CONTRIBUTING files with detailed usage examples, API endpoint documentation, and testing guidelines.
  - Develop unit and integration tests covering all endpoints, ensuring reliability and performance under a range of scenarios.

## Value Proposition
By merging the HTTP_API and OBSERVABILITY features into the WEB_SERVICE module, the repository now provides a powerful, single-point solution for both remote schema management and real-time diagnostics. This consolidation promotes a streamlined user experience, reduces maintenance overhead, and aligns with our mission to simplify API evolution and foster collaborative, error-free development.
