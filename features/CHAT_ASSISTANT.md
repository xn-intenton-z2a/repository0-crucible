# Chat Assistant

This feature introduces an interactive chat-based assistant to owl-builder. The Chat Assistant leverages the Chat Completions API provided by OpenAI to help users troubleshoot, understand, and interact with the tool in real-time. Users can ask questions about ontology generation, diagnostic logs, and CLI usage to receive contextual assistance based on the live state of the system.

## Overview

- **Interactive Querying:** Users can enter queries through the CLI (e.g., `--chat "How do I update an ontology?"`) and receive concise, helpful responses.
- **Contextual Assistance:** The assistant can provide explanations of diagnostic logs, suggestions for configuration adjustments, or guide users through troubleshooting steps.
- **Enhanced User Experience:** Integrates conversational capabilities into owl-builder, allowing both new and experienced users to quickly resolve issues and learn about available features.
- **Live Integration:** Uses real-time diagnostic information along with static documentation to form the context for responses.

## Implementation Details

- **API Integration:** Utilize the existing OpenAI package to submit user queries as chat completions. The integration should manage API keys securely and properly handle failures or rate limits.
- **CLI Flag:** Introduce a new CLI flag `--chat` that accepts a query string. When invoked, the tool will package relevant context (e.g., recent diagnostic summaries, version information) and send it to the Chat Completions API.
- **Response Formatting:** Parse and display the response in the CLI in a user-friendly format. Optionally, support output formatting (e.g., markdown) for better readability.
- **Configuration Options:** Allow users to configure parameters such as temperature and model selection through environment variables or CLI options.
- **Error Handling:** Ensure that network issues or API errors are gracefully handled, providing clear messages to the user.

## Testing

- **Unit Tests:** Verify that the chat interface correctly packages queries and handles responses from a mocked Chat Completions API.
- **Integration Tests:** Simulate full interaction cycles via the CLI to ensure that the complete workflow (query input, API call, response display) functions as expected.
- **Edge Cases:** Test with empty queries, long queries, and API error simulations to ensure robust error messaging and fallback behavior.

This feature aligns with the mission of owl-builder by enhancing the live data integration experience with real-time support and diagnostics, making it easier to navigate and troubleshoot complex ontology building processes.
