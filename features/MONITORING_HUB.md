# Monitoring Hub

## Overview
The Monitoring Hub feature consolidates the previously separate web server and diagnostics functionalities into a single, unified interface. This module provides both an HTTP-based status and telemetry dashboard as well as an interactive CLI dashboard. It is designed to offer real-time system health monitoring, aggregated diagnostic logging, and convenient troubleshooting tools in one lightweight, maintainable source file.

## Implementation Details
- **Unified HTTP Endpoints:** Combine the core functionalities of the existing web server (e.g. `/` for basic status) and diagnostics manager (e.g. `/diag/summary` for aggregated telemetry) into one module. By leveraging existing functions like `serveWebServer` and diagnostic log aggregation utilities, the Monitoring Hub will present a comprehensive status report through a single web interface.
- **Interactive CLI Dashboard:** Extend the CLI with a dedicated flag (e.g. `--diagnostic-dashboard`) that displays real-time diagnostics and telemetry directly in the terminal. The dashboard supports filtering by log level and other diagnostic parameters, making it easier to pinpoint issues.
- **Aggregated Telemetry & Enhanced Logging:** Integrate the promise-based batching mechanism for logging invalid environment variable inputs and other diagnostics data. Maintain access to aggregated telemetry via a CLI flag (e.g. `--diagnostic-summary-naN`) so that users can view warning counts and associated context.
- **Modular and Maintainable Design:** Implement the Monitoring Hub in a single source file, ensuring high cohesion and easier maintenance. Documentation and tests will be updated to reflect the consolidated endpoints, providing clear examples for both HTTP and CLI usage.

## Benefits
- **Simplified User Experience:** Users have a single entry point to monitor system health and diagnostics without toggling between separate interfaces.
- **Improved Maintainability:** Combining similar functions reduces code redundancy and streamlines future enhancements and debugging.
- **Enhanced Diagnostics:** Aggregated telemetry and interactive CLI dashboards allow for quicker issue detection and resolution, ultimately improving overall system stability.
