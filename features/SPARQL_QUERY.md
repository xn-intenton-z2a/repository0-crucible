# SPARQL_QUERY Feature

This feature introduces a new CLI flag, --sparql, that simulates executing a SPARQL query against an OWL ontology dataset. When invoked, the CLI tool will output a JSON formatted simulated SPARQL query result based on sample data from public ontologies. This aligns with our mission of providing example tools for querying OWL ontologies.

## Updates in Source File (src/lib/main.js)
- Add a new branch in the main function to detect the --sparql flag.
- When the flag is detected, call a new function executeSPARQLQuery that simulates running a SPARQL query. The function will output a JSON result with keys such as "result" and "bindings".
- The simulated output can be a simple JSON object, e.g. { result: 'Sample SPARQL query response', bindings: [] }.
- This change is self-contained and follows the style of existing flags in the CLI tool.

## Updates in Test File (tests/unit/main.test.js)
- Add a new test case to simulate the invocation of the CLI with the --sparql flag.
- Capture console output and assert that the result is valid JSON containing a key "result" with value "Sample SPARQL query response" and a "bindings" key that is an array.

## Updates in README File (README.md)
- Update the Usage section to document the new --sparql flag.
- Provide an example command, for instance: node src/lib/main.js --sparql.
- Describe the expected JSON output and mention its role in demonstrating basic SPARQL query simulation functionality.

## Updates in Dependencies File (package.json)
- No changes to existing dependencies are required as the current setup supports the new flag functionality.

This feature is designed to be straightforward and maintainable, expanding the CLI tool with simulated SPARQL query capability in line with our library's mission of demonstrating OWL ontology interaction using public data.
