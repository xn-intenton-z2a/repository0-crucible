# ENV_TELEMETRY: Environment Variable Telemetry and Validation

## Overview
This feature modularizes the environment variable handling, normalization, and telemetry aggregation currently inline within the main module. It is designed to validate environment variables (especially numeric inputs), aggregate diagnostic telemetry, and provide a clear interface for exporting and monitoring environment configuration issues. By isolating these responsibilities, the codebase becomes more maintainable and easier to extend with new diagnostics or configuration options.

## Implementation Details
1. **Normalization and Parsing**
   - Implement a utility to trim, collapse, and convert environment variable values to lower-case.
   - Provide functions such as `normalizeEnvValue` and `parseEnvNumber` that check for non-numeric inputs and explicitly normalized 'nan' values.
   - Allow CLI-provided overrides to take precedence, while ensuring fallbacks to default values if invalid input is detected.

2. **Telemetry Aggregation**
   - Aggregate warnings for non-numeric inputs including detailed telemetry (timestamp, raw value, normalized value, and override status).
   - Implement a debounced flush mechanism configured via an environment variable (e.g., `TELEMETRY_FLUSH_DELAY`).
   - Expose methods to retrieve aggregated telemetry summaries (for instance, via a CLI flag such as `--diagnostic-summary-naN`).

3. **Integration with CLI and Other Modules**
   - Integrate the telemetry export functionality with CLI commands by providing easy-to-use interfaces for JSON and CSV output of the collected data.
   - Enable this module to interface smoothly with both the core engine and user interface, ensuring that environment configuration issues are logged and visible during runtime.

## Benefits
- **Improved Maintainability:** Decouples environment configuration handling from core engine logic, promoting modular design.
- **Enhanced Diagnostics:** Provides a centralized way to monitor and address misconfigured environment variables, reducing runtime errors and improving user feedback.
- **Flexible Configuration:** Supports CLI overrides and customizable thresholds for logging, which aligns with the mission of providing robust, dynamic configuration management.

## Migration Notes
- Refactor existing inline functions (`normalizeEnvValue`, `parseEnvNumber`, `resetEnvWarningCache`, and `getAggregatedNaNSummary`) in the main module to use this new module.
- Update the documentation and tests to reference the new ENV_TELEMETRY module, ensuring that any environment variable related issues are documented and covered by tests.
- There is no deletion of existing features as this new module complements the existing USER_INTERFACE and CORE_ENGINE features.
