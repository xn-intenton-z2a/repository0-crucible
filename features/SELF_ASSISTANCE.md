# SELF_ASSISTANCE

## Overview
This feature consolidates self-improvement, introspection, help-seeking, and enhanced diagnostic logging into a unified module. In this update, we introduce a verbose logging mode that leverages the chalk library to produce color-coded output. This enhancement provides clear, detailed feedback during CLI operations, improves error messaging, and aligns with our mission of transparent, autonomous automation.

## Implementation Details
1. **Verbose Logging with Chalk:**
   - Introduce a new CLI flag `--verbose` that, when activated, enables detailed, color-coded logs throughout the CLI tool.
   - Update the main CLI entry point to check for the `--verbose` flag. When present, wrap critical log outputs with chalk functions: error messages in red, confirmations and informational logs in green or blue.
   - For example:
     ```js
     import chalk from 'chalk';
     if (args.includes('--verbose')) {
       console.log(chalk.green('Verbose mode activated.'));
     }
     ```
   - Ensure that operations remain uncolored when `--verbose` is not active, preserving backward compatibility.

2. **Integration with Existing Functions:**
   - Retain all existing self-improvement, memory logging, and help-seeking behaviors.
   - When both `--verbose` and `--help-seeking` flags are active, merge detailed logs with external assistance messages seamlessly.
   - Update error handling routines to conditionally use chalk for enhanced readability in verbose mode.

3. **Testing and Documentation Updates:**
   - Update unit tests (in `tests/unit/main.test.js`) to simulate CLI calls with `--verbose` and verify that log outputs include expected ANSI color codes.
   - Ensure tests confirm that normal (non-verbose) execution produces the standard, uncolored logs.
   - Revise the README (README.md) to include a section on the new `--verbose` flag, complete with usage examples, such as:
     ```bash
     node src/lib/main.js --verbose --help-seeking
     ```
   - Add documentation that explains the benefits of verbose logging in troubleshooting and diagnostic efforts.

4. **Dependencies Update:**
   - Add the `chalk` library (e.g., "chalk": "^5.0.0") to the dependencies in the package.json. This ensures proper color-coded formatting of outputs in verbose mode.
   - Confirm that the addition complies with Node 20 and ECMAScript Module standards.

## Long-Term Direction
Enhancing verbose logging lays the groundwork for more granular debug levels and dynamic log formatting features in the future. This update not only improves the user experience during troubleshooting but also reinforces our commitment to creating a transparent, self-improving automation tool aligned with the overall mission of autonomous intelligent automation.
