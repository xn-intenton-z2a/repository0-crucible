# SELF_ASSISTANCE

## Overview
This update refines the SELF_ASSISTANCE feature by adding verbose logging using the chalk library. When the CLI is invoked with the `--verbose` flag, key messages from self-refinement and help-seeking routines are color-coded for improved clarity and diagnostic effectiveness. This enhancement retains all existing self-improvement and help-seeking behaviors while providing visual feedback that aligns with our mission of transparent and intelligent automation.

## Implementation Details
1. **Verbose Logging Activation:**
   - Import the `chalk` library at the top of `src/lib/main.js` (e.g. `import chalk from 'chalk';`).
   - In the `main` function, check if `--verbose` is included in the arguments. If so, set a global flag (e.g. `globalThis.verboseMode = true`) and output an activation message (e.g. using `chalk.blue` to display "Verbose mode activated.").

2. **Conditional Log Formatting:**
   - In functions such as `selfRefine()` and `helpSeeking()`, modify the log statements to check if `globalThis.verboseMode` is active. If true, wrap informational messages with `chalk` (for instance, using `chalk.green` for standard messages and `chalk.red` for errors). For example:
     ```js
     function selfRefine() {
       if (globalThis.verboseMode) {
         console.log(chalk.green('Performing self-refinement analysis...'));
       } else {
         console.log('Performing self-refinement analysis...');
       }
     }
     ```
   - Similarly update the `helpSeeking()` function to output color-coded messages when verbose mode is active.

3. **Integration with Existing Logic:**
   - Ensure that all other behaviors (self-improvement, memory logging, standard CLI responses) remain unchanged. The verbose flag should only enhance the display of output without altering functionality.

## Testing
1. **Unit Tests:**
   - Update tests in `tests/unit/main.test.js` to simulate CLI calls with the `--verbose` flag combined with `--self-refine` and `--help-seeking`.
   - Verify that the output messages include ANSI color codes (for example, checking that the output strings contain escape sequences typical of chalk formatting).

2. **Regression Testing:**
   - Run the full test suite to ensure that non-verbose modes still output uncolored text, confirming backward compatibility.

## Documentation
1. **README Update:**
   - Enhance the CLI Options section of `README.md` by adding the following entry:
     ```bash
     node src/lib/main.js --verbose --self-refine
     ```
   - Document that when `--verbose` is active, key operational messages are colorized to help users quickly identify statuses and errors.

2. **Dependency Update:**
   - Add the `chalk` library (e.g., "chalk": "^5.0.0") to the dependencies in `package.json` to ensure proper color-coded formatting of outputs.

## Long-Term Direction
This enhancement sets the stage for more granular debug levels and dynamic log formatting features in future releases. By providing immediate, readable feedback through color-coded console messages, the self-improvement routines will be easier to monitor, thereby reinforcing our commitment to developing an autonomous, self-aware automation tool.
