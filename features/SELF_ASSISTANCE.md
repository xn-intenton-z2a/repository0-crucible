# SELF_ASSISTANCE

## Overview
This feature consolidates the existing self-improvement and help-seeking capabilities into a unified self-assistance module. The goal is to enhance agent introspection, detailed logging, and external consultation in situations where the agent encounters challenges. Integrating verbose logging with external help-seeking provides a streamlined approach to both self-reflection and obtaining assistance, all while ensuring alignment with the overarching mission of autonomous intelligent automation.

## Implementation Details
1. **Verbose Logging and Diagnostics:**
   - Update `src/lib/main.js` to activate a verbose mode when the `--verbose` flag is present. Detailed logs should include entry/exit points of functions, timestamps, and operation context.
   - Ensure that verbose logs are non-intrusive and can be toggled off for regular CLI usage.

2. **Help-Seeking Integration:**
   - Repurpose and integrate the existing help-seeking logic into this single module. When the CLI flag `--help-seeking` is used (or when a command with a "help:" prefix is detected), trigger an external consultation using the OpenAI API.
   - Handle the response gracefully, returning a formatted answer in the CLI output. If the API call fails, provide a clear error message advising the user.

3. **Unified Error Handling:**
   - Merge error logs from both self-improvement and help-seeking operations to provide a consistent diagnostic output.
   - Maintain global counters (like callCount) and ensure every help-seeking invocation is logged with its context.

4. **Testing and Documentation:**
   - Update unit tests in `tests/unit/main.test.js` to include scenarios for both verbose logging activation and help queries.
   - Revise the README to document the new `SELF_ASSISTANCE` capability, detailing usage examples such as:
     ```bash
     node src/lib/main.js --verbose --help-seeking
     ```
   - Ensure that both standard command execution and error conditions are adequately covered by tests.

## Long-Term Direction
The SELF_ASSISTANCE feature lays the groundwork for a smarter, more self-aware agent. Future iterations may include automatic error escalation, adaptive logging strategies based on runtime performance, and deeper integration with external knowledge bases for more robust help-seeking. By unifying these aspects, the agent is better equipped to continuously learn from its environment and improve its own operational strategies.
