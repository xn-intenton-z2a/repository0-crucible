# SELF_ASSISTANCE

## Overview
This feature consolidates self-improvement, introspection, help-seeking, and enhanced diagnostic logging into a unified module. In this update, we enhance error handling and logging by introducing a verbose mode that leverages color-coded output using the chalk library. The unified approach maintains transparency, simplifies diagnostic output, and aligns with our mission of autonomous intelligent automation.

## Implementation Details
1. **Verbose Logging with Chalk:**
   - Introduce a new CLI flag `--verbose`. When provided, the CLI will use the chalk library to output detailed, color-coded logs for function entries, exits, and variable states.
   - Enhance error messages so that all unrecognized commands and error outputs are displayed in red, using chalk to improve clarity.
   - Ensure that when both `--verbose` and `--help-seeking` are active, the verbose logs are incorporated seamlessly with external assistance messages.

2. **Standardized Error Handling:**
   - All unrecognized or invalid commands will output a standardized error message in red, for example:
     ```js
     const errorMessage = chalk.red(`Error: '${input}' is not a recognized command. Use '--help' for available options.`);
     console.error(errorMessage);
     ```
   - This reinforces consistency and improves user guidance.

3. **Integration with Existing Diagnostic and Logging Features:**
   - Retain existing self-reflection, memory logging, and diagnostic functions as described in earlier iterations of SELF_ASSISTANCE.
   - The verbose mode is an overlay – when `--verbose` is not provided, the CLI behaves as before without color-coding.

## Testing
1. **Unit Tests:**
   - Update tests in `tests/unit/main.test.js` to simulate CLI calls with the `--verbose` flag and verify that outputs contain expected ANSI color codes (e.g., red for error messages).
   - Ensure that normal operation without `--verbose` still produces uncolored output, preserving backward compatibility.

2. **Integration Verification:**
   - Run end-to-end tests to confirm that when both `--verbose` and `--help-seeking` are provided, the output merges detailed logging with help-seeking messages.
   - Validate that the verbose logs include clear markers for function entry and exit with appropriate color highlighting.

## Documentation
1. **README Update:**
   - Document the new `--verbose` flag in the CLI Options section, explaining that it enables detailed, color-coded logs using chalk.
   - Update usage examples as follows:
     ```bash
     node src/lib/main.js --verbose --help-seeking
     ```
   - Clearly note that error messages will now appear in red when in verbose mode.

2. **Dependencies File:**
   - Add the chalk library (e.g. "chalk": "^5.0.0") as a dependency in the `package.json` to support color-coded logging output.

## Long-Term Direction
Enhancing SELF_ASSISTANCE with verbose, colored logging sets the stage for richer diagnostic features. Future iterations could include customizable log levels, dynamic log formatting, and more granular tracing of the system’s operations. By ensuring that all errors and diagnostics are clear and visually distinct, the system aligns more closely with our mission of transparent, autonomous intelligent automation.
