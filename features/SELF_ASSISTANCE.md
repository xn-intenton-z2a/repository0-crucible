# SELF_ASSISTANCE

## Overview
This feature consolidates the self-improvement, introspection, and help-seeking capabilities of the CLI tool into a unified module. In this update, the feature is extended to include a fully implemented verbose logging mode activated via a new `--verbose` CLI flag. Verbose mode logs detailed entry and exit points for functions, timestamps, and contextual information, using colored output (via the `chalk` library) to improve clarity. In addition, the existing help-seeking functionality is maintained, ensuring that when the agent faces uncertainties, it can consult external resources and provide formatted responses. This combined self-assistance capability reinforces the mission of autonomous intelligent automation by enhancing diagnostic feedback and operational transparency.

## Implementation Details
1. **Verbose Logging Mode:**
   - Modify the source file (`src/lib/main.js`) to detect the `--verbose` flag. When present, log detailed information about function entry/exit points, key variable values, timestamps, and context. Use `chalk` (which should be added as a dependency in the dependencies file) to color-code these logs (e.g., blue for verbose messages, green for success messages).
   - Update existing functions (such as `main` and `handleInvalidCommand`) to emit verbose logs at the start and end of command processing. For example, log a message like "[VERBOSE] Entering main() at <timestamp>" and correspondingly on exit.
   - Ensure that verbose logs do not interfere with standard CLI output and can be toggled off for regular operation.

2. **Help-Seeking Integration:**
   - Retain the existing help-seeking behavior triggered by the `--help-seeking` flag (or commands prefixed with "help:"). When invoked, the system uses external consultation (e.g., via the OpenAI API) to retrieve assistance, and any responses are formatted using colored output for clarity.
   - Consolidate all diagnostic outputs (including error messages) into a unified logging strategy when verbose mode is active.

3. **Testing Adjustments:**
   - Update test cases in `tests/unit/main.test.js` to simulate the `--verbose` flag and verify that detailed logs (prefixed with identifiers like "[VERBOSE]") are output. Use mocks or spies on `console.log` to check for these verbose messages.
   - Modify tests for error handling and help-seeking to take into account the colored outputs (stripping ANSI color codes as needed for assertions).

4. **Documentation Updates (README.md):**
   - Enhance the CLI Options section to include documentation for the `--verbose` flag. Provide usage examples such as:
     ```bash
     node src/lib/main.js --verbose --help-seeking
     ```
   - Explain that enabling verbose mode will output additional diagnostic logs, including timestamps and function execution flow, all color-coded for improved readability.

5. **Dependency Update:**
   - Add the `chalk` library as a dependency in the `package.json` file. Ensure the version is compatible (e.g., "chalk": "^5.1.0") so that colored output can be reliably implemented.

## Long-Term Direction
This enhancement serves as a stepping stone toward a more introspective and self-aware agent. In future iterations, the verbose logging can be further refined with configurable log levels, dynamic filtering of diagnostic output, and integration with external logging services. Combined with existing self-improvement and help-seeking strategies, the agent will continue to evolve its operational transparency and resilience, aligning with the mission of creating autonomous, cross-repository intelligent automation.
