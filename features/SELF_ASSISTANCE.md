# SELF_ASSISTANCE

## Overview
This feature consolidates the self-improvement, introspection, help-seeking, and enhanced diagnostic logging capabilities of the CLI tool into a unified module. In this update, the feature is extended to include a fully implemented verbose logging mode activated via a new `--verbose` CLI flag. Verbose mode logs detailed entry and exit points for functions, timestamps, and contextual information, all using colored output (via the `chalk` library) to improve clarity. In addition to the enhanced logging, the existing help-seeking functionality (triggered via `--help-seeking`) is retained, reinforcing the mission of autonomous intelligent automation by delivering clear diagnostic feedback and operational transparency.

## Implementation Details
1. **Verbose Logging Mode:**
   - Modify the source file (`src/lib/main.js`) to detect the `--verbose` flag. When present, the tool will log detailed information about function entry and exit points, key variable values, and timestamps. For example, at the start and end of the main processing routine, log messages such as "[VERBOSE] Entering main() at <timestamp>" and "[VERBOSE] Exiting main() after <duration> ms".
   - Use the `chalk` library (which should be added as a dependency in `package.json`) to enhance readability by color-coding the verbose messages (e.g., blue for detailed logs, green for successful operations).
   - Ensure verbose logging does not interfere with the standard CLI output and can be toggled off by default.

2. **Help-Seeking Integration:**
   - Retain the existing behavior for the `--help-seeking` flag. When this flag is provided, the system consults external resources (e.g. via the OpenAI API) and outputs formatted, colored diagnostic feedback.
   - Integrate verbose output with help-seeking such that, when both `--verbose` and `--help-seeking` are supplied, detailed diagnostic logs are output alongside the help response.

3. **Testing Adjustments:**
   - Update tests in `tests/unit/main.test.js` to simulate passing the `--verbose` flag. Verify that the console output includes verbose log messages prefixed with identifiers like "[VERBOSE]".
   - Ensure tests for help-seeking and error handling account for the additional verbose logging details, stripping ANSI color codes when asserting expected output if necessary.

4. **Documentation Updates (README.md):**
   - Enhance the CLI Options section by documenting the new `--verbose` flag. Provide examples, such as:
     ```bash
     node src/lib/main.js --verbose --help-seeking
     ```
   - Clearly explain that enabling verbose mode outputs additional diagnostic information including function call details and timestamps, all rendered in color for clarity.

5. **Dependency Update:**
   - Add the `chalk` library as a dependency in `package.json` (e.g., "chalk": "^5.1.0") to support colored output throughout the verbose logging and error handling routines.

## Long-Term Direction
The enhancements under SELF_ASSISTANCE lay the foundation for a self-aware, introspective CLI tool that not only seeks external assistance when uncertain but also logs its internal processing in a detailed, human-readable way. Future iterations may introduce configurable log levels, dynamic filtering of diagnostic messages, and integrations with remote logging or monitoring services, all of which continue to align with the mission of creating an autonomous, cross-repository intelligent automation system.
