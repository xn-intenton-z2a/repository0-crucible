# SELF_ASSISTANCE

## Overview
This feature consolidates self-improvement, introspection, help-seeking, and enhanced diagnostic logging with improved error formatting into a unified module. It integrates verbose logging, colored output for both diagnostic and error messages, and detailed validation feedback. This consolidation provides clearer, color-coded output for operational transparency while aligning with the mission of autonomous intelligent automation.

## Implementation Details
1. **Verbose Logging and Help-Seeking:**
   - Detect the `--verbose` flag in the CLI to log detailed information (function entries/exits, variables, timestamps) using the `chalk` library for color-coded output.
   - Retain the existing help-seeking behavior (`--help-seeking`) and integrate verbose details when both flags are present.

2. **Enhanced Error and Input Validation:**
   - Update the error handling in the source file (`src/lib/main.js`), so that unrecognized commands display colored error messages. Use `chalk.red` for errors and accent colors (like blue or yellow) for suggestions and instructions.
   - Refine the error messages for numeric-like inputs (e.g. `NaN`, `123`, `-5`, `3.14`) to include clear, color-coded guidance on proper command usage.

3. **Testing Adjustments:**
   - Update tests in `tests/unit/main.test.js` to verify that verbose logging outputs and error messages include the appropriate color codes. Strip ANSI codes if necessary during test assertions.
   - Ensure tests reflect both the original functionality (help-seeking, self-refinement, etc.) and the new enhanced error output.

4. **Documentation Updates:**
   - Amend the README (README.md) to document the expanded SELF_ASSISTANCE feature. Add examples showing the use of `--verbose` along with error messages and help-seeking messages that now include colored output.

5. **Dependency Considerations:**
   - Ensure the `chalk` library is added as a dependency in package.json. Update dependency versions if necessary to meet Node 20 and ESM standards.

## Long-Term Direction
By merging enhanced input validation and diagnostic error messaging into SELF_ASSISTANCE, the tool not only provides operational introspection and help-seeking capabilities but also ensures that user errors are communicated in an immediate, visually accessible manner. This integrated approach lays a robust foundation for future dynamic logging features and more adaptive, context-aware user feedback.
