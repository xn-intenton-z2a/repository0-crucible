# XML_TOOL: OWL Export/Import Utility

## Overview
This feature adds command-line and API support for exporting and importing ontologies in a standardized OWL XML format. It leverages the existing library functions for XML conversion, encapsulating them into dedicated CLI flags and API endpoints. The goal is to increase interoperability with other ontology tools and provide users with a simple, reliable method to convert ontology data.

## Functionality
- **Export Command:**
  - New CLI flag `--export-xml` to export the current ontology to an XML file.
  - Uses the existing `exportOntologyToXML` function to transform the ontology and writes the output to, for example, `ontology.xml`.
  
- **Import Command:**
  - New CLI flag `--import-xml` possibly taking a file path as parameter to import an ontology from an XML file.
  - Uses the existing `importOntologyFromXML` function to convert the XML back to a JSON ontology representation.

## Implementation Details
- Integrate new CLI argument parsing in the main module, similar to how other commands (e.g., `--export-telemetry`) are handled.
- Add clear logging and diagnostic messages for success or error states during export/import operations.
- Update the documentation (README and CONTRIBUTING) to include usage examples and the expected XML format.

## Benefits
- **Interoperability:** Standardizes ontology data exchange using OWL XML, easing integration with external tools.
- **User Experience:** Provides a straightforward method to backup, share, or migrate ontology data across systems.
- **Lightweight Integration:** Implemented as a single-source addition, aligning with the repository structure and mission.

## Migration and Backwards Compatibility
- Existing functionality remains unaffected in CORE_ENGINE and USER_INTERFACE.
- Users can gradually adopt XML export/import capabilities via extended CLI commands, ensuring backward compatibility.
