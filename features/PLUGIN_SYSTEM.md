# PLUGIN_SYSTEM Feature

## Overview
The PLUGIN_SYSTEM feature introduces an extensible architecture that allows developers to integrate custom plugins into the repository. This approach enables third-party extensions to enhance functionalities such as JSON schema validation, diff generation, risk analysis, and operational diagnostics without altering the core codebase.

## Architecture & Design
- **Modular Plugin Interface:** Define a clear interface for plugin development so that contributors can hook into key processes (e.g., pre-validation, post-diff analysis, automatic fix recommendations).
- **Dynamic Loading:** Allow plugins to be dynamically loaded from a designated directory or through configuration, ensuring ease of integration and updates.
- **Isolation:** Maintain plugin isolation to prevent conflicts with core functionalities, ensuring safety and reliability.

## CLI & HTTP Integration
- **CLI Command Extension:** Introduce CLI flags (e.g., `--list-plugins`, `--load-plugin <plugin-name>`) which integrate seamlessly with the existing commands in SCHEMA_MANAGER and OPERATIONS.
- **HTTP Endpoints:** Offer dedicated HTTP endpoints for managing plugins, enabling remote administration and triggering of plugin operations.

## Implementation & Testing
- **Single Source File Extension:** Implement the plugin system in a new source file (e.g., `src/lib/plugin_system.js`) and update the main command parser to integrate this functionality.
- **Comprehensive Tests:** Develop unit and integration tests to verify plugin loading, execution of hooks, error handling, and performance impact.
- **Documentation:** Update the repository documentation and README to include usage examples, plugin development guidelines, and configuration instructions.

## Value Proposition
The PLUGIN_SYSTEM feature empowers users to tailor the repository functionalities to their specific needs, promoting a vibrant ecosystem of third-party extensions. This not only enriches the core capabilities but also aligns with our mission to simplify API change management by facilitating customizable and scalable enhancements.
