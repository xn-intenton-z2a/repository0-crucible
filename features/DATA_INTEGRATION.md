# DATA_INTEGRATION

This feature consolidates the live data acquisition routines by merging the functionalities previously provided by the SCHEDULER and DATA_CRAWLER features. It provides an automated mechanism for fetching, processing, and refreshing ontology data from multiple public endpoints in real time.

## Overview

- **Automated Data Refresh:** Runs at configurable intervals, triggering live data integration to keep the ontology up-to-date. 
- **Concurrent Data Crawling:** Simultaneously gathers data from numerous public endpoints using asynchronous calls with robust retry and exponential backoff logic.
- **Unified Diagnostic Logging:** Leverages the existing diagnostic logging system to trace each refresh and crawling operation, including error handling.
- **Configurable Operation:** Allows customization of refresh intervals and retry parameters via environment variables and CLI overrides.
- **Seamless Integration:** Works in tandem with existing telemetry and WebSocket notification systems to broadcast updates to connected clients.

## Implementation Details

- **Asynchronous Loop:** Implement an asynchronous loop that periodically invokes the live data integration functions (e.g., `buildOntologyFromLiveData`) and persists the updated ontology.
- **Parallel Crawling:** Use Promise-based batching to gather data concurrently from endpoints, integrating with functions such as `fetchDataWithRetry`.
- **Error Handling and Telemetry:** Log diagnostic events for each attempt, including failures and successful updates. Ensure that errors are handled gracefully and that fallback data is used when necessary.
- **Configuration Management:** Parse environment variables like `SCHEDULER_INTERVAL`, `LIVEDATA_RETRY_COUNT`, and `LIVEDATA_INITIAL_DELAY` consistently to ensure that CLI overrides are respected without delays.
- **WebSocket and Notifications:** Upon successful data refresh, broadcast updates via the WebSocket server to provide real-time notifications to users.

## Benefits

- **Improved Data Freshness:** Regularly updates the ontology with current live data from multiple sources.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Merges redundant code from the previous SCHEDULER and DATA_CRAWLER features, reducing maintenance overhead.
- **Robustness:** Enhanced error handling through retries and aggregated telemetry, ensuring continuous operation even under intermittent network issues.
- **User Impact:** Provides real-time notifications and visual feedback through the integrated WebSocket system, ensuring users are always informed about system status.
