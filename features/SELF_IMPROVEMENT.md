# SELF_IMPROVEMENT Feature

## Overview
This feature introduces a new command-line flag `--self-improve` into the CLI tool. When invoked, the tool will display a message indicating that self-improvement mode is activated. This mode is intended to serve as a foundation for future enhancements that track performance, log self-monitoring data, and provide feedback for automated self-enhancement â€” aligning with the overarching mission of agentic, self-improving automation.

## Implementation Details
- **Source File Updates (src/lib/main.js):**
  - Extend the `main` function to check for the presence of the `--self-improve` flag in the command-line arguments.
  - If the flag is detected, output a clear message such as "Self improvement mode enabled" and exit immediately, ensuring no further commands are processed for clarity.
  
  Example snippet:
  ```javascript
  if (args.includes('--self-improve')) {
    console.log('Self improvement mode enabled');
    return;
  }
  ```

- **Test File Updates (tests/unit/main.test.js):**
  - Add tests to simulate CLI invocation with the `--self-improve` flag.
  - Verify that the CLI outputs the correct message "Self improvement mode enabled".

- **README File Updates (README.md):**
  - Update the Usage section to document the new `--self-improve` flag.
  - Provide an example command and a brief description:
    ```bash
    node src/lib/main.js --self-improve
    ```
  - Explain that this flag is a stepping stone for future self-monitoring and automated self-enhancement capabilities.

- **Dependencies File:**
  - No new dependencies are required for this feature.

## Expected Benefits
- **Enhanced Diagnostic Capabilities:** Provides an initial framework for self-monitoring and performance tracking, setting the stage for further self-improvement features.
- **Alignment with Mission:** Supports the mission of agentic automation by introducing an element that encourages self-reflection and performance optimization.
- **Incremental Enhancement:** Lays the groundwork for future iterations where deeper performance analytics and adaptations may be integrated.
