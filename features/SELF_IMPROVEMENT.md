# SELF_IMPROVEMENT

## Overview
Self-improvement enhances the agent by allowing it to evaluate its own performance, monitor runtime metrics, and provide actionable diagnostics. This update refines the existing SELF_IMPROVEMENT feature by adding a dedicated CLI flag for self-check, improved runtime metric tracking, and automated suggestions based on error trends. The goal is to empower users with immediate feedback about the agent’s health and foster a foundation for iterative, autonomous improvement.

## Implementation Details
- **CLI Diagnostics Flag:** Modify the main source file (src/lib/main.js) to parse a new flag (e.g. `--self-check`). When detected, the agent should bypass normal command processing and output a summary of its internal metrics such as command count (`globalThis.callCount`) and error count (`globalThis.errorCount`).
- **Runtime Metrics:** Introduce counters for tracking command executions and errors. Update the `agenticHandler` (or similar execution point) so that every command increments `globalThis.callCount` and errors increment `globalThis.errorCount`.
- **Automated Suggestions:** After executing a batch of commands, check if `globalThis.errorCount` exceeds a set threshold. If so, append a suggestion message to the output (e.g. "Suggestion: Review the failing commands or adjust performance-related configuration.").
- **Test Enhancements:** Extend unit tests in tests/unit/main.test.js to simulate invoking the self-check flag and invalid command scenarios. Verify that the diagnostics output contains keys such as the number of commands executed and any suggestion messages.
- **README Updates:** Update README.md to document the new `--self-check` functionality. Provide usage examples and demonstrate how a developer might use the diagnostics output to monitor the agent’s performance.

## Long-Term Direction
This enhancement lays the groundwork for iterative self-improvement. In the future, additional metrics (such as timing or resource usage) could be integrated, with potential for the agent to auto-correct configuration issues based on historical data. By balancing detailed diagnostics with automated suggestions, the system remains aligned with our mission of continuous, intelligent collaboration and refinement.
