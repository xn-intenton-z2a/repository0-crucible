# SELF_IMPROVEMENT

## Overview
This feature enhances the agent’s self-improvement capability by implementing an explicit CLI diagnostics command. The diagnostics mode provides immediate runtime feedback by outputting key metrics such as the number of processed commands and errors encountered. This update builds on the existing self-improvement foundation and ensures that the agent is introspective and can guide developers during troubleshooting.

## Implementation Details
- **CLI Diagnostics Flag:**
  - Update the main source file (`src/lib/main.js`) to parse the CLI arguments. When the flag `--diagnostics` is present in the arguments, bypass normal processing and output a diagnostics summary.
  - The summary should include metrics such as `globalThis.callCount` (command count) and `globalThis.errorCount` (error count). For example, log a message in the form: "Self-Check: X commands executed, Y errors, environment OK".

- **Runtime Metrics Tracking:**
  - Initialize global counters (`globalThis.callCount` and `globalThis.errorCount`) at the start of the execution.
  - Increment `globalThis.callCount` for each command processed and update `globalThis.errorCount` whenever an error is encountered.

- **Test Enhancements:**
  - Update `tests/unit/main.test.js` to include tests that simulate running the agent with the `--diagnostics` flag. The test should capture the output and verify that the expected diagnostic keys are present.

- **README Documentation Updates:**
  - Amend `README.md` to document the new diagnostics flag. Include usage examples such as:
    ```bash
    node src/lib/main.js --diagnostics
    ```
  - Explain that diagnostics mode is intended to provide immediate feedback on runtime performance and error tracking.

## Integration with Repository Scope
This update is achieved by modifying existing files only:
- Source file: `src/lib/main.js` (CLI flag parsing and diagnostics output).
- Test file: `tests/unit/main.test.js` (new test case for diagnostics).
- README file: `README.md` (documentation update).
- Dependencies: No new external dependencies are added; the update uses the existing Node environment and libraries.

This refined self-improvement feature aligns with the repository’s mission of creating an autonomous, introspective agent capable of self-assessment and continuous improvement.
