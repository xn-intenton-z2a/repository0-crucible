# SELF_IMPROVEMENT

## Overview
This enhancement refines the existing self-improvement feature by integrating a comprehensive verbose logging mode. Activated via the `--verbose` flag, the feature provides detailed, step-by-step logging of critical operations, thereby improving observability and aiding in troubleshooting. The verbose mode lays the groundwork for future adaptive self-improvement processes.

## Implementation Details
1. **Verbose Flag Activation:**
   - Update `src/lib/main.js` to inspect command-line arguments for the `--verbose` flag. 
   - If present, establish a global flag (e.g., `globalThis.verboseMode = true`) early in the function execution to conditionally enable detailed logging.

2. **Enhanced Logging:**
   - Wrap key operations (such as diagnostics, command execution, memory logging, and help-seeking) with additional logging statements when verbose mode is active.
   - Log entry and exit of major functions along with timestamps and contextual information to help trace the flow of execution.

3. **Test Updates:**
   - Modify tests in `tests/unit/main.test.js` to simulate CLI invocations using the `--verbose` flag.
   - Use spies on `console.log` to verify that, when verbose mode is enabled, detailed log messages (for example, markers like "Entering <function>" and "Exiting <function>") are produced without interfering with standard outputs.

4. **Documentation:**
   - Update the README (`README.md`) to document the new `--verbose` CLI option.
   - Provide usage examples to show how the verbose logging mode enhances diagnostic output and supports troubleshooting.

## Testing & Validation
- Ensure that without the `--verbose` flag, the CLI operates with the standard logging level while retaining all existing functionalities.
- When `--verbose` is active, verify that additional logs are emitted for each critical step without altering the overall behavior of the CLI.

## Long-Term Direction
This verbose logging mechanism is a foundational step towards more advanced self-improvement capabilities. In future iterations, the enhanced logging data may be leveraged for dynamic performance tracking, automated adjustments, and proactive error resolution, thereby progressively refining the agentâ€™s operational efficiency.
