# SELF_IMPROVEMENT

## Overview
This feature empowers the agent with self-diagnostic capabilities to monitor its own performance during runtime. Building upon the previous implementation, it now includes not only tracking of command executions and error counts but also additional runtime diagnostics such as process uptime and memory usage. With these additions, developers can gain deeper insights into the agent's operational health, allowing for immediate feedback and facilitating iterative refinement.

## Implementation Details
- **CLI Diagnostic Flag (`--self-check`):**
  - The main source file (src/lib/main.js) will be updated to detect the `--self-check` flag. When this flag is present, the agent bypasses normal command processing and outputs a diagnostic summary.
  - The diagnostic summary will include metrics such as `globalThis.callCount`, `globalThis.errorCount`, process uptime (using Node's `process.uptime()`), and memory usage (using `process.memoryUsage()`).

- **Runtime Metrics Enhancements:**
  - Maintain counters for command executions and errors.
  - Integrate additional diagnostics: record the process start time and calculate uptime each time diagnostics are requested.
  - Report memory statistics by capturing heap total and heap used information.

- **Automated Suggestions:**
  - As before, if error counts exceed a preset threshold, the output will append automated suggestions to review configurations or inspect failing commands.

- **Testing Updates:**
  - Extend unit tests in tests/unit/main.test.js to simulate invoking the `--self-check` flag and verifying that the diagnostic output contains keys such as `callCount`, `errorCount`, `uptime`, and `memoryUsage`.
  - Ensure that the tests verify proper formatting of the diagnostic output and that no modifications are made to other parts of the CLI flow when diagnostics are run.

- **README Documentation:**
  - Update README.md to include instructions on using the `--self-check` functionality. Provide examples demonstrating how to execute the flag and interpret the diagnostic output.

## Long-Term Direction
This enhanced self-improvement feature lays the groundwork for even more autonomous performance tuning. Future iterations may include advanced error trend analysis, automated configuration adjustments, or persistent storage of diagnostic data to inform long-term improvements. Overall, the aim is to continue refining the agent's self-monitoring capabilities, perfectly aligning with our mission of continuous refinement, practical automation, and intelligent collaboration.
