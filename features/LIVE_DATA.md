# LIVE_DATA

This feature centralizes and enhances live data integration for ontology building, ensuring that ontologies are continuously updated with verified public data. It leverages robust error handling, exponential backoff with jitter, and a configurable retry mechanism managed through both environment variables and CLI overrides.

## Overview

- **Live Data Fetching:** Augments the core ontology builder by tightly integrating live data retrieval from verified public endpoints. 
- **Resilient Network Operations:** Implements an exponential backoff with randomized jitter for retries to gracefully handle transient network failures.
- **Configurable Parameters:** Enables users to customize live data fetch behavior using environment variables (or CLI overrides) for properties such as retry count and initial delay.
- **Fallback Mechanism:** Provides a safe fallback to a legacy static ontology in case live data retrieval fails, ensuring uninterrupted operations.

## Implementation Details

- **Retry and Backoff:** Enhance the existing `fetchDataWithRetry` function to support dynamic adjustment of retry parameters via environment variables (`LIVEDATA_RETRY_COUNT`, `LIVEDATA_INITIAL_DELAY`) with CLI override support (`--livedata-retry-default`, `--livedata-delay-default`).
- **Diagnostic Integration:** Integrate with the unified diagnostics system to log detailed telemetry for each live data fetch attempt, including timestamps, error messages, and retry statistics.
- **Live Data Builder:** Centralize calls to `buildOntologyFromLiveData` and related functions into a cohesive live data manager that monitors, aggregates, and processes live feed data before merging it into the final ontology.
- **Fallback Safety:** Ensure that if live data integration is disabled (via environment variable or CLI flag) or ultimately fails after all retries, the system automatically falls back to the static ontology without disrupting workflow.

## Benefits

- **Up-to-Date Ontologies:** Guarantees that ontologies are built with the latest data from trusted sources, directly supporting the mission of dynamic OWL ontology generation.
- **Operational Resilience:** The robust error handling and backoff mechanism ensures high availability, even in fluctuating network conditions.
- **User Flexibility:** With configurable live data parameters and a simple mechanism to disable live integration, users can fine-tune performance, resource consumption, and reliability according to their environment.
