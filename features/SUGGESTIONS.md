# SUGGESTIONS Feature Specification

## Overview
This feature enhances the error handling of the CLI tool by providing intelligent suggestions when users input unrecognized commands. If a user types a command that is close to one of the supported flags (e.g. a typo), the CLI will now analyze the input and suggest the correct flag. This improvement not only enhances user experience but also aligns with our mission by making the system more user-friendly and autonomous in guiding its own operation.

## Implementation Details
1. **Enhanced Error Handling:**
   - Update the `handleInvalidCommand` function in `src/lib/main.js` to compute a similarity score between the unrecognized input and the list of valid command flags (e.g. "--help", "--version", etc.).
   - Use a simple string comparison heuristic or a basic Levenshtein distance calculation (without additional dependencies) to detect if the input closely resembles a valid command.
   - If a close match is found within a reasonable threshold, append a suggestion to the error message, for example: "Did you mean '--help'?".

2. **Source File Modifications:**
   - Modify the error handling block so that after printing the standardized error message, it also checks for potential valid commands and prints a suggestion line if applicable.
   - Ensure that the function remains non-intrusive when no close matches are found.

## Testing
1. **Unit Tests:**
   - Update tests in `tests/unit/main.test.js` for unrecognized inputs to verify that, when a near-match is provided (e.g. "--hlp" or "--verson"), the output includes a suggestion message.
   - Verify that the suggestion logic does not trigger for completely unrelated inputs, preserving the original error message format.

2. **Regression Testing:**
   - Run the full test suite to ensure that all valid commands still work as expected and that the suggestion mechanism only enhances the error messaging without altering core functionalities.

## Documentation
1. **README Update:**
   - Update the CLI Options documentation in `README.md` to include a note that unrecognized commands will now include suggestions based on similarity with valid commands.
   - Provide usage examples, for instance:
     ```bash
     node src/lib/main.js --hlp
     # Output: Error: '--hlp' is not a recognized command. Did you mean '--help'? Use '--help' for available options.
     ```

2. **User Guidance:**
   - Update any help sections to mention the new suggestion behavior, making sure users are aware that minor typos will be corrected via suggestions.

## Long-Term Direction
This feature lays the foundation for more advanced natural language parsing and contextual error recovery mechanisms. As the project evolves, future iterations may incorporate more sophisticated techniques, such as fuzzy matching and machine learning based command predictions. This will further enhance the system's autonomy and user guidance capabilities, in line with our ongoing mission of intelligent and resilient automation.
