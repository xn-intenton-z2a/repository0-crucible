# Ontology Manager Feature (Comprehensive Lifecycle Operations)

The Ontology Manager remains the central module responsible for managing live ontology data with robust diagnostic logging, dynamic data integration, and an enriched set of operations including backup, refresh, merging, and customizations. This updated specification expands upon the existing functionality by incorporating additional live data aggregation, concurrent crawling, and extended CLI-driven operations that support a complete ontology lifecycle management.

## Live Data Integration & Caching

- **Real-time Data Fetching:** Continuously retrieve ontology data from verified public endpoints. In the event of API failures, use a reliable static fallback.
- **Schema and Data Validation:** Employ Zod-powered schemas to validate incoming posts, classes, properties, and metadata.
- **Caching Strategies:** Support configurable caching options (in-memory or file based) and facilitate cache refresh/invalidation via CLI commands or environment variables.
- **Concurrent Data Crawling:** Integrate a concurrent crawling mechanism to fetch live data from multiple endpoints, aggregating successes and capturing detailed error diagnostics for failed endpoints.

## Diagnostic Logging & CLI Operations

- **Enhanced Diagnostics:** Implement structured, timestamped logs covering cache performance, API request attempts (with exponential backoff and jitter), and telemetry events such as non-numeric environment variable warnings.
- **CLI-driven Controls:** Provide CLI commands for building, updating, querying, refreshing, merging, and backing up ontologies. Extended commands include:
  - `--refresh`: Clear existing ontology data and refresh from live endpoints.
  - `--merge-persist`: Merge static and live ontologies and persist the merged result.
  - `--backup-refresh`: Create a backup and then refresh the ontology.
  - `--build-hybrid`: Build a hybrid ontology by blending live data with custom user inputs.

## Extended Operations & Customization

- **Backup and Persistence:** Offer mechanisms for both scheduled and on-demand backup of ontology files, ensuring data integrity in case of failures.
- **Custom Data Integration:** Support building ontologies from custom inputs, merging live data with user-provided modifications to tailor the ontology.
- **Merging & Hybridization:** Facilitate ontology merging from multiple sources to create a comprehensive ontology view and include automated timestamp tracking for decentralized updates.

## Enhanced Web Dashboard & Developer Experience

- **Interactive Dashboard:** Enhance the integrated web server to deliver a rich HTML dashboard, providing real-time system health metrics, live data visualization, and links to trigger operations (refresh, backup, diagnostics).
- **Unified Management Interface:** By consolidating operations such as live data integration, diagnostic logging, backup, merging, and custom data handling, the Ontology Manager streamlines troubleshooting and operational transparency.

This comprehensive update aligns with the mission of owl-builder by ensuring that the latest ontology data is consistently integrated, maintained, and available for rapid development and troubleshooting.
