# Ontology Manager Enhancement

This update refines the existing Ontology Manager feature to not only maintain robust live data integration, caching, backup, merging and CLI-driven operations but also to extend a dedicated HTTP API layer. This HTTP API will expose critical ontology operations such as build, refresh, query, backup and merge. This enhancement leverages the existing live data integration functions while transforming the web server into a comprehensive RESTful endpoint server.

## Live Data Integration & Caching

- **Real-time Data Fetching:** Continue using verified public endpoints with exponential backoff and jitter to fetch live data. In case of failure, fallback to static ontology ensuring high availability.
- **Caching Strategies:** Support configurable caching methods (in-memory and file-based) to boost performance and reduce redundant API calls.
- **Concurrent Data Crawling:** Utilize concurrent fetching from multiple endpoints with detailed error diagnostics to offer a unified live data view.

## Diagnostic Logging & CLI Operations

- **Structured Diagnostic Logging:** Maintain detailed, timestamped logs for each operation (fetch, merge, refresh) with clear error messages and telemetry for non-numeric environment variable inputs as per the inline validation rules.
- **CLI Controls:** Preserve the CLI commands for operations such as `--refresh`, `--backup`, `--merge-persist`, and integrate these with environment variable overrides and strict validation modes as defined.

## HTTP API Integration

- **RESTful Endpoints:** Augment the current CLI web server to serve a full HTTP API. Endpoints will include:
  - `GET /ontology` to fetch the current ontology.
  - `POST /ontology/refresh` to trigger a live data refresh and persist the result.
  - `POST /ontology/backup` to create an on-demand backup.
  - `POST /ontology/merge` to merge static and live ontologies.

- **Security and Configurability:** Use environment variables to configure API port, diagnostic log level, and fallback behaviors. Ensure proper validation and error responses in case of failures.

## Benefits & Alignment with Mission

- **Rapid Remote Management:** Empower users to manage and update ontologies remotely via a standardized HTTP API.
- **Improved Developer Experience:** Combine CLI and HTTP API controls into one unified interface, encouraging seamless integration in microservices or internal tools.
- **Increased Operational Transparency:** Enable real-time system health checks and diagnostics directly through API calls, in line with owl-builder's mission of providing live, high-quality ontology data.

This enhancement consolidates live data integration, diagnostic logging, and remote management capabilities into a single, robust feature that underpins the core mission of owl-builder.
