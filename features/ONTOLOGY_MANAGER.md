# Ontology Manager

This feature introduces a dedicated ontology management module to support key operations related to OWL ontologies. It provides an integrated CLI command and library functions to build, persist, merge, and query OWL ontologies stored as JSON files.

## Overview

The Ontology Manager embraces the mission of owl-builder by enabling users to:
- Build OWL ontologies from live and verified public data sources.
- Persist OWL ontologies as JSON files for easy sharing and integration.
- Merge multiple OWL ontology files into a single coherent model.
- Query OWL ontologies via a straightforward CLI interface and library function calls.

## Features

- **Build Functionality:** Retrieve public data sources and generate OWL ontologies automatically.
- **Persistence Layer:** Read and write OWL ontology data in JSON format, ensuring consistent data management.
- **Merge Operations:** Combine multiple JSON representations of OWL ontologies into a unified structure.
- **Query Interface:** Provide CLI commands and library functions for searching and filtering within OWL ontologies.
- **Extensible API:** Easy-to-use interfaces that can later be integrated with REST APIs or other delivery mechanisms.

## Implementation

- The changes will be introduced in the main repository file in a modular fashion, ensuring minimal changes to existing structure.
- Unit tests will be added using vitest to cover each functionality.
- The CLI tool will parse sub-commands and delegate to corresponding functions implemented in separate functions within a new file or as part of the existing module.

This feature adheres to the existing contribution guidelines and builds on the mission statement of owl-builder, aiming to provide immediate valuable functionality in managing OWL ontologies.
