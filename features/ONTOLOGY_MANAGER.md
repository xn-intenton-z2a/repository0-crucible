# Ontology Manager Enhancement

This feature continues to provide comprehensive ontology management including live data integration, caching, automated refresh, diagnostic logging, and extended export/import support. In this update, we introduce a new set of REST API endpoints that expose the ontology functionality to external applications. The REST API will be implemented as an update to the existing single source file supporting ontology operations, ensuring consistency with the repository design and mission.

## Live Data Integration & Caching

- **Real-time Data Fetching:** Continuously retrieve ontology data from trusted public endpoints with configurable retries, exponential backoff, and jitter.
- **Caching Strategies:** Utilize both in-memory and file-based caching to reduce redundant API calls and optimize performance.
- **Concurrent Data Crawling:** Support parallel data fetching from multiple endpoints to ensure robust live data integration.
- **Dynamic Endpoint Ranking:** Analyze endpoint performance using historical log data to prioritize high-quality sources.

## Scheduled Refresh & Automated Operations

- **Automated Refresh Scheduler:** Provide a configurable scheduler that triggers ontology refreshes based on environment variables or CLI flags.
- **User Configurability:** Allow configuration of refresh intervals via environment variables (e.g. `LIVEDATA_REFRESH_INTERVAL`) and CLI overrides.
- **Fallback and Diagnostics:** Log detailed diagnostic messages with fallbacks to a static ontology when live integration fails.

## Extended Export/Import Support

- **Multi-format Export:** Extend export capabilities to include JSON-LD format alongside the existing XML export, supporting improved interoperability with semantic web applications.
- **Consistent API Design:** Maintain a unified approach to export/import functions within the single source file, ensuring ease of maintenance and consistency.

## New REST API Endpoints

To expand the accessibility and integration of ontology management, the following REST API endpoints are introduced:

- **GET /ontology**
  - Returns the current ontology in JSON format, enabling external systems to retrieve the latest state.

- **POST /ontology/refresh**
  - Triggers a live data refresh to rebuild the ontology immediately and persist updated data.

- **GET /ontology/backup**
  - Provides a backup copy of the current ontology data, useful for recovery and auditing purposes.

- **GET /ontology/diagnostics**
  - Exposes diagnostic logs and summarized telemetry (including aggregated NaN fallback events) to assist with monitoring and troubleshooting.

- **GET /ontology/version**
  - Returns the current tool version along with a timestamp, ensuring transparency of the deployed state.

These endpoints leverage the existing functions (e.g. `buildOntologyFromLiveData`, `refreshOntology`, `backupOntology`, etc.) and integrate seamlessly with the CLI and environment configurations.

## CLI and HTTP Integration

- **CLI Controls:** The REST API functionality is integrated into the CLI interface, allowing maintainers to start the web server (via the `--serve` flag) and interact with the endpoints.
- **Single Source Coherence:** All enhancements, including REST API functionality, are implemented within a single source file to maintain high cohesion and ease of updates.
- **Enhanced Diagnostics:** Diagnostic logging remains robust, with additional logging for REST API interactions to aid in debugging and performance monitoring.

## Documentation and Testing

- **Usage Examples:** Update the README and CONTRIBUTING documents to include examples for invoking the new API endpoints both through HTTP calls and via CLI tools.
- **Unit and Integration Tests:** Extend current unit tests and integration tests (using vitest) to cover the new REST API endpoints. Consider tests for endpoint responses, error handling, and diagnostic outputs.

By integrating these REST API endpoints into the Ontology Manager, the tool will not only continue to offer robust live data integration and ontology manipulation but also provide a modern interface for external integrations and automated workflows.
