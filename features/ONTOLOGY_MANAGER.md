# Ontology Manager Feature (Enhanced)

The Ontology Manager remains the central module for handling live ontology data along with related foundations such as caching, diagnostics, scheduled tasks, and now an integrated web server interface. This unified feature is responsible for building ontologies from live verified data sources, merging live and static ontologies, and exposing useful status and diagnostic endpoints via both CLI and HTTP.

## Live Data Integration & Caching

- **Live Data Integration:** Utilizes verified public endpoints to build ontologies in real-time. When live fetch fails, the module gracefully falls back to a static ontology.
- **Schema Validation:** Implements strict data quality checks using Zod-powered schemas to verify ontology properties (titles, concepts, classes, properties, and metadata).
- **Caching Layer:** Employs in-memory or file-based caching of ontology data with configurable TTL. Refresh and invalidation can be triggered by CLI commands or environment settings.

## Diagnostics, CLI Options & Scheduled Refresh

- **Diagnostic Logging:** Provides detailed logs including cache hits/misses, live data fetch attempts with exponential backoff and jitter details, and warns on misuse of environment configurations. Logs are structured and emitted with ISO timestamps.
- **CLI Integration:** Exposes commands for building, updating, persisting, querying, refreshing, and merging ontologies, with CLI overrides taking precedence over environment variables.
- **Scheduled Refresh & Backup:** Supports automated refresh and backup scheduling of the ontology via configurable intervals. Scheduled tasks log diagnostics and can trigger cache invalidation and backup routines.

## Web Server Integration

- **HTTP Endpoint:** Integrates a lightweight web server which serves a status endpoint (e.g., at `/`) providing a plain-text confirmation that the tool is running.
- **Status and Diagnostics:** The web server can be extended to present current live ontology status, cached data summaries, and diagnostic logs. This interface aids development and operational monitoring by offering real-time insight into system health.
- **Simple Deployment:** Designed to run as a single source file library; deployment can be accomplished with minimal additional infrastructure using Node.js.

## Benefits

- **Unified Management:** Combines live data processing, caching, diagnostic logging, and HTTP status serving into one cohesive feature.
- **Automated Maintenance:** Reduces manual checks by scheduling refresh and backups as well as offering immediate web-based status feedback.
- **Developer Productivity:** Enhanced CLI commands and integrated web server simplify troubleshooting and monitoring of ontology data.

This enhancement aligns closely with the mission of owl-builder to maintain current and accurate ontologies from live data sources while facilitating robust diagnostics and ease of operation.
