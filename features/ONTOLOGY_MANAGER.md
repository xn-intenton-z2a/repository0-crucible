# Ontology Manager Enhancement

This feature consolidates ontology management functions including live data integration, CRUD operations, caching, scheduled refresh, and diagnostic logging while now extending export capabilities to support JSON-LD format. This update builds on the legacy functionality and integrates new export/import options to improve interoperability with semantic web and linked data systems.

## Live Data Integration & Caching

- **Real-time Data Fetching:** Continuously retrieve ontology data from trusted public endpoints with configurable retries and exponential backoff including jitter.
- **Caching Strategies:** Utilize both in-memory and file-based caching to reduce redundant API calls and optimize update performance.
- **Concurrent Data Crawling:** Support parallel data fetching from multiple endpoints to ensure robust live data integration.
- **Dynamic Endpoint Ranking:** Analyze endpoint performance using historical logs to prioritize high-quality data sources.

## Scheduled Refresh & Automation

- **Automated Refresh Scheduler:** Provide a configurable scheduler that automatically triggers ontology refreshes at regular intervals via CLI flags and/or environment variables.
- **User Configurability:** Allow users to configure live refresh intervals (e.g. using `LIVEDATA_REFRESH_INTERVAL` or CLI flag `--live-refresh`).
- **Fallback and Diagnostics:** If live data integration fails, log detailed diagnostics and fall back to the static ontology.

## Diagnostic Logging & CLI Controls

- **Enhanced Diagnostics:** Log detailed diagnostic messages with timestamps for every operation including live data fetch attempts, retries, and fallback events.
- **CLI Integration:** Support robust CLI options for manual triggers (e.g. `--build-live`, `--refresh`), status reporting, and diagnostic insights. This ensures maintainers have direct control over ontology operations.

## JSON-LD Export/Import Support

- **Extended Export Options:** Introduce new functionality to export ontologies in JSON-LD format in addition to the existing XML export. This ensures compatibility with semantic web standards and promotes interoperability.
- **CLI Integration:** Add a new CLI flag (e.g. `--export-jsonld`) that triggers the JSON-LD export functionality.
- **Consistent API Design:** Implement the JSON-LD export/import logic in the existing single source file to maintain code coherence and consistency with other export functions.
- **Documentation & Testing:** Update README and CONTRIBUTING guidelines with usage examples of JSON-LD export/import. Extend unit tests to cover the new JSON-LD functionality.

By integrating JSON-LD support, the Ontology Manager not only continues to provide live integrated ontology management with automated scheduling and comprehensive diagnostics but also facilitates further consumption of ontology data by modern web and semantic applications.
