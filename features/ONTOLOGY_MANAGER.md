# Ontology Manager

This feature introduces a dedicated module to manage OWL ontologies with multiple interfaces. It covers building, persisting, merging, and querying OWL ontologies stored as JSON files, and now extends its functionality by exposing a REST API for broader integration.

## Overview

The Ontology Manager is central to owl-builder and is designed to:
- Build OWL ontologies from live and verified public data sources.
- Persist OWL ontologies as JSON files for easy sharing and integration.
- Merge multiple OWL ontology files into a unified model.
- Query OWL ontologies via a CLI interface, library functions, and now a REST API.

## CLI and Library Integration

- **Build Functionality:** Automatically retrieve public data sources and generate OWL ontologies.
- **Persistence Layer:** Read and write OWL ontology data in JSON format with consistent data management.
- **Merge Operations:** Combine and streamline multiple JSON ontology representations.
- **Query Interface:** Provide commands for filtering and searching within OWL ontologies via CLI and library function calls.

## REST API Extension

- **HTTP Server Integration:** Introduce a lightweight HTTP API using Node.js built-in modules to expose ontology management operations.
- **Endpoint Design:** The API will include endpoints for building, persisting, merging, and querying ontologies. These endpoints follow a RESTful approach with clear request and response structures.
- **Usage and Deployment:** Designed for simple deployment as part of a single repository, the server can be initiated from the CLI, enhancing versatility in integration with external systems 
  (e.g., GraphDB import workflows).
- **Testing and Documentation:** Unit tests using vitest will cover new HTTP routes. Documentation and usage examples, including inline code and CLI/HTTP examples, will be added in the README.

## Implementation Details

- **Single Repository Scope:** All changes will be implemented in the existing module structure with minimal alterations to preserve repository cohesiveness.
- **Modular Functions:** The REST API endpoints will leverage the same modular functions used by CLI and library components to enforce DRY principles.
- **Testing:** New tests will be added to verify HTTP channel responses along with the core ontology management functionalities.

This update not only enhances the Ontology Managerâ€™s functionality but also solidifies its alignment with the mission to build and manage OWL ontologies in a simple, integrated manner.
