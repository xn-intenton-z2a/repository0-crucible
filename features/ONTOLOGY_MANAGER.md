# Ontology Manager Enhancement

This feature drives the core functionality of owl-builder by orchestrating live data integration, caching, diagnostics, and ontology CRUD operations. It is responsible for fetching live data from verified public endpoints and converting this data into a robust OWL ontology with extensive diagnostic logging and CLI controls.

## Live Data Integration & Caching

- **Real-time Data Fetching:** Continues to use verified public endpoints with exponential backoff and jitter. In case of failures, automatically falls back to the static ontology.
- **Caching Strategies:** Supports in-memory and file-based caching methods to reduce redundant API calls and enhance performance.
- **Concurrent Data Crawling:** Implements concurrent data crawling from multiple endpoints with detailed error diagnostics.
- **Dynamic Data Source Ranking:** Introduces a new module that monitors the performance metrics of configured API endpoints. This component collects historical response times, success/error rates, and diagnostic logs to dynamically rank endpoints. The highest-quality endpoints are prioritized for live data integration, boosting overall reliability and data freshness.
