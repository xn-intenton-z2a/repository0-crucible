# Ontology Manager Feature (Enhanced with Dashboard)

The Ontology Manager remains the central module for handling live ontology data and related operations. In this update, we extend the existing functionality by integrating an enhanced interactive dashboard. This dashboard provides real-time monitoring of ontology status, caching performance, diagnostic logs, and environment telemetry. This extended interface is delivered as an HTML view via the integrated web server, making system status insights more accessible to users.

## Live Data Integration & Caching

- **Live Data Integration:** Continues to fetch real-time ontology data from verified public endpoints. On failure, falls back to a robust static ontology.
- **Schema Validation:** Maintains rigorous data validation using Zod-powered schemas for posts, classes, properties, and metadata.
- **Caching Layer:** Offers configurable caching with in-memory or file-based options, supporting refresh and invalidation via CLI and environment settings.

## Diagnostics, CLI Options & Scheduled Refresh

- **Diagnostic Logging:** Provides structured, timestamped logs for cache hits/misses, API fetch attempts including exponential backoff and jitter details.
- **CLI Integration:** Supports commands for building, updating, querying, refreshing, merging, backing up, and diagnostics of ontologies.
- **Scheduled Tasks:** Automates refresh and backup operations at configurable intervals with diagnostic feedback.

## Enhanced Web Server & Dashboard Integration

- **HTTP Endpoint:** Previously, the web server offered a plain-text status page. Now, an interactive HTML dashboard is integrated to provide a comprehensive view of the system's health.
- **Dashboard Features:**
  - **Real-time Status:** Display current live ontology results, cache statistics, and aggregated diagnostic logs.
  - **Telemetry Data:** Visualize environment telemetry events (e.g., non-numeric env variable warnings) and configuration details.
  - **User Interactivity:** Links for triggering refresh, backup, and diagnostic reports directly from the dashboard.
- **Developer Benefits:** Simplifies troubleshooting by offering an immediate, browser-based overview of live operations and health metrics.

## Benefits

- **Unified Management:** Consolidates live data fetching, caching, diagnostics, and an interactive dashboard into a single cohesive module.
- **Improved Monitoring:** Enhances operational transparency and aids in rapid troubleshooting by making key system metrics accessible via a modern web interface.
- **Developer Productivity:** Simplifies the workflow with enhanced CLI commands and an intuitive dashboard, aligning closely with the mission to maintain accurate, current ontologies with robust diagnostics.
