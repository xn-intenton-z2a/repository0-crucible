# Ontology Manager Feature

The Ontology Manager feature consolidates core ontology functionalities into a single, cohesive module. It merges the interactive ontology visualization, diagnostic dashboard, and robust schema validation, while introducing a new caching layer for improved performance and resilience during live data integration.

## Overview

- **Unified Interface:** Combines interactive graph display with real-time diagnostics and data quality validation to provide a comprehensive view of the ontology.
- **Schema Validation:** Uses Zod-powered schemas to ensure that the ontology data (title, concepts, classes, properties, and metadata) adhere to strict quality standards before proceeding with visualization or further processing.
- **Caching Layer:** Introduces a configurable caching system (in-memory and/or file-based) to store live data responses. This reduces the dependency on external endpoints during peak loads or temporary network failures. Cache invalidation can be configured via CLI options or environment variables.
- **HTTP API Integration:** Extends the existing lightweight web server to serve both live and cached ontology data via endpoints such as `/ontology` and `/diagnostics`.

## Implementation Details

- **Merge Existing Modules:**
  - Integrate the functions from the original Ontology Visualizer (including the interactive dashboard and diagnostics) and the Schema Validator into a single module.
  - Ensure that the full functionality of both visualization and validation is retained.
- **Caching Mechanism:**
  - Implement a simple caching layer that stores ontology data retrieved from live endpoints.
  - Provide configuration options (via CLI flags or environment variables) for cache expiration and manual refresh.
  - During a cache hit, the system will serve the cached ontology; on a cache miss or forced refresh, it will fetch and validate new live data and update the cache.
- **CLI and API Updates:**
  - Update the CLI to include new flags for enabling/disabling caching and setting cache lifetimes.
  - Extend HTTP API endpoints to optionally return cached data and to trigger cache refresh.
- **Diagnostics and Logging:**
  - Integrate the new caching operations with existing diagnostic logging to record cache hits, misses, and refresh events.

## Testing & QA

- **Unit Tests:** Ensure that caching, live data fetching, and schema validation work as expected.
- **Integration Tests:** Simulate network failures to verify that the caching layer provides fallback data without degrading the overall performance.
- **Performance & Security:** Evaluate the cacheâ€™s impact on system performance and validate that sensitive diagnostic and validation data are appropriately sanitized before exposure through API endpoints.
