# Ontology Manager Enhancement

This feature consolidates live data integration, ontology CRUD operations, caching, and diagnostic logging with a scheduled live refresh mechanism. It merges the core ontology management functionality with the automated refresh scheduling from the legacy LIVE_REFRESH feature.

## Live Data Integration & Caching

- **Real-time Data Fetching:** Continuously retrieve and update ontology data from verified public endpoints with exponential backoff and jitter.
- **Caching Strategies:** Utilize both in-memory and file-based caching to reduce redundant API calls and optimize performance.
- **Concurrent Data Crawling:** Support parallel data fetching from multiple endpoints, ensuring robust and reliable live data integration.
- **Dynamic Endpoint Ranking:** Analyze API endpoint performance through historical logs to prioritize high-quality data sources.

## Scheduled Refresh & Automation

- **Automated Refresh Scheduler:** Incorporate a configurable scheduler that automatically triggers ontology rebuilds at regular intervals.
- **User Configurability:** Allow users to set the refresh interval through environment variables (e.g., `LIVEDATA_REFRESH_INTERVAL`) and optional CLI flags (e.g., `--live-refresh`).
- **Fallback and Diagnostics:** In case of failures during refresh, automatically log detailed diagnostic information and revert to a static ontology if needed.

## Diagnostic Logging & CLI Controls

- **Enhanced Diagnostics:** Provide comprehensive diagnostics and logs for each attempt to fetch live data, including error reporting and retry details.
- **CLI Integration:** Maintain robust CLI options for manual triggers, status reporting, and diagnostic insights, while ensuring consistency with the overall repository mission.

## Implementation Details

- **Merged Functionality:** Integrate the scheduling mechanism from the legacy LIVE_REFRESH feature into the core ONTOLOGY_MANAGER module.
- **Single Source File:** Implement the enhanced functionality in a single repository source file, ensuring coherence and ease of maintenance.
- **User Documentation:** Update README and CONTRIBUTING guidelines to reflect the new combined feature, including examples of CLI commands and environment configuration.

This consolidated approach empowers users to manage OWL ontologies with up-to-date, live data while automating periodic refreshes to guarantee data freshness and reliability.
