# Ontology Manager Enhancement

This feature drives the core functionality of owl-builder by orchestrating live data integration, caching, diagnostics, and ontology CRUD operations. It is responsible for fetching live data from verified public endpoints and converting this data into a robust OWL ontology with extensive diagnostic logging and CLI controls.

## Live Data Integration & Caching

- **Real-time Data Fetching:** Continues to use verified public endpoints with exponential backoff and jitter. In case of failures, automatically falls back to the static ontology.
- **Caching Strategies:** Supports in-memory and file-based caching methods to reduce redundant API calls and enhance performance.
- **Concurrent Data Crawling:** Implements concurrent data crawling from multiple endpoints with detailed error diagnostics.

## Diagnostic Logging & CLI Operations

- **Structured Diagnostic Logging:** Logs all operations (e.g. build, refresh, merge) with timestamped entries. Non-numeric environment variable inputs are flagged with enriched telemetry (including raw input, CLI override flag, and ISO timestamp) to aid troubleshooting.
- **CLI Controls:** Preserves and extends CLI commands (e.g. `--refresh`, `--backup`, `--merge-persist`, `--build-live`) with strict validation and configurable overrides via environment variables.

## HTTP API Integration

- **RESTful Endpoints:** Enhances the existing web server to provide RESTful API endpoints that support ontology retrieval (`GET /ontology`), live data refresh (`POST /ontology/refresh`), backup (`POST /ontology/backup`), and merging (`POST /ontology/merge`).
- **Security & Configurability:** Endpoints are configurable using environment variables for port, log level, and fallback behaviors, ensuring proper input validation and error responses.

## Webhook Notifications

- **Event-Based Notifications:** Introduces webhook support to notify external systems whenever critical ontology events occur (such as successful refresh, backup completion, or merge failures).
- **Configurable Endpoints:** Users can specify one or more webhook URLs via an environment variable (e.g. `WEBHOOK_URLS`), which the system will call with a JSON payload containing event details and diagnostic metadata.
- **Reliable Delivery:** The webhook notifications include retry logic with exponential backoff to improve reliability. Failures in sending a notification do not block core ontology operations but are logged for later analysis.

## Benefits & Mission Alignment

- **Rapid Remote Management:** Integrates both CLI and HTTP API endpoints into one unified control interface, enabling seamless remote management and automated workflows.
- **Enhanced Operational Transparency:** Provides real-time diagnostics and webhook notifications for proactive monitoring and rapid problem resolution.
- **Streamlined Developer Experience:** Consolidates live data integration, error recovery, and notification systems to align with owl-builderâ€™s mission of delivering live, high-quality ontology data.
