# Diagnostic Dashboard

This feature introduces a real-time dashboard for aggregating, monitoring, and analyzing diagnostic telemetry and log events generated by the owl-builder tool. By presenting a consolidated view of retry attempts, fallback warnings, and other key metrics, users can quickly assess the performance of live data integration and environment configuration handling.

## Overview

- **Real-Time Telemetry:** Aggregates diagnostic messages (including environment variable fallback warnings and fetch retry attempts) into a single, interactive view.
- **Interactive Interface:** Provides a web-based dashboard accessible via a dedicated CLI flag (e.g., `--dashboard`) or integrated with the existing web server. Users can filter, search, and inspect log details.
- **Enhanced Troubleshooting:** Allows maintainers and users to correlate diagnostic events with live data fetch performance and retry behaviors, aiding in debugging and optimization.
- **Configurable Views:** Supports customization of diagnostic log levels (e.g., error, warn, info) and time range filters to focus on specific events.

## Implementation Details

- **Data Aggregation Module:** Implement a new module (e.g. `src/lib/diagnosticDashboard.js`) that intercepts diagnostic logs from existing functions (such as `logDiagnostic` and the environment variable parser) and stores these events in an in-memory store or lightweight database.
- **Web Interface:** Extend the integrated web server or add a new HTTP endpoint (triggered via the `--dashboard` CLI flag) to serve an interactive HTML/JS dashboard. Utilize libraries like Chart.js or D3.js to display telemetry trends.
- **WebSocket Integration:** For real-time updates, establish a WebSocket or Server-Sent Events (SSE) connection between the server and the client, ensuring that updates to the diagnostic log store are pushed immediately to the dashboard.
- **CLI Command:** Add a new CLI flag (`--dashboard`) to launch the diagnostic dashboard. This command should initialize the logging aggregation and open the default browser to display the dashboard.
- **Configuration & Customization:** Allow users to configure dashboard parameters (such as log level filtering and refresh intervals) via CLI options or environment variables.

## Testing

- **Unit Tests:** Write tests to verify that diagnostic events are correctly captured, aggregated, and stored by the new module.
- **Integration Tests:** Ensure that starting the dashboard via the CLI flag correctly initializes the HTTP endpoint and that the web interface loads expected diagnostic metrics.
- **Real-Time Update Tests:** Simulate log events during execution and confirm that the dashboard updates dynamically without requiring a full page reload.
- **Edge Case Handling:** Test scenarios with high-frequency log events to verify performance and proper memory handling.

This feature enhances the mission of owl-builder by improving observability over live data integration processes, enabling proactive troubleshooting and improvement of the tool's reliability and performance.
