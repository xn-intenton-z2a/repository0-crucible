# DIAGNOSTICS_MANAGER

This feature consolidates the diagnostic and telemetry functionalities from the existing Issue Generator and ENV_MONITOR modules into a unified diagnostics manager. It provides both enriched, context-aware issue generation and a real-time telemetry dashboard, streamlining how developers monitor and act on diagnostic data.

## Overview

- **Centralized Diagnostics:** Combine aggregated diagnostic logs, telemetry data (including NaN fallback warnings and environmental misconfiguration alerts), and enhanced error context from live data integration into a single diagnostics module.
- **Issue Generation Integration:** Enrich issue generation workflows by incorporating detailed telemetry snapshots (error counts, warning frequencies, timestamps, and CLI override contexts) to facilitate targeted resolutions.
- **Real-Time Telemetry Dashboard:** Expose an HTTP endpoint (e.g., `/diag/summary`) that displays a user-friendly dashboard summarizing diagnostic events, aggregated warnings, and environmental validations for remote monitoring.
- **Configurable CLI Options:** Provide CLI flags such as `--diagnostic-summary` and `--diagnostic-summary-naN` to allow users to trigger diagnostics summaries and view aggregated telemetry data directly from the CLI.

## Implementation Details

- **Telemetry Aggregation:** Merge the logic from the existing ENV_MONITOR and ISSUE_GENERATOR features to collect and de-duplicate diagnostic messages, ensuring that duplicate normalized invalid inputs (like non-numeric environment variables) are logged only once, even under high concurrency.
- **Context-Aware Issue Generation:** Update the issue generation process to automatically include the aggregated telemetry data along with recent diagnostic logs, commit summaries, and function documentation, providing a richer context to support troubleshooting.
- **Web Dashboard Endpoint:** Implement a lightweight HTTP server route that renders diagnostic metrics including environment variable validation errors, aggregated warning counts, and other key telemetry data. The endpoint will be documented for quick status checks.
- **Documentation & Testing:** Update the README and CONTRIBUTING documentation to reflect the consolidated diagnostic functionalities. Expand unit and integration tests to cover the new merged behaviors and ensure backward compatibility with legacy CLI commands.

## Benefits

- **Improved Maintenance:** By merging related diagnostics features, the repository reduces code duplication, increases maintainability, and provides a single source of truth for telemetry and diagnostic information.
- **Enhanced Issue Context:** Automated enrichment of generated issues with diagnostic telemetry supports faster, more accurate troubleshooting and resolution of problems.
- **Streamlined Monitoring:** A unified diagnostics dashboard offers a real-time view of system health, making it easier for maintainers to monitor and respond to operational anomalies.
