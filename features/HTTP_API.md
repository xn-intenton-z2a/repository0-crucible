# HTTP_API Feature

## Overview
This feature provides an HTTP API layer that exposes the core functionalities of JSON Schema diff management and observability in a web-accessible format. It leverages the functionality of the SCHEMA_MANAGER and OBSERVABILITY modules to allow remote clients and third-party integrations to interact with the application using standard HTTP requests.

## Core Functionalities
- **Schema Diff Endpoints:**
  - Expose endpoints to generate, retrieve, and compare JSON schema diffs.
  - Support endpoints for persistent storage operations including rollback and audit trail retrieval.

- **Observability Endpoints:**
  - Provide real-time diagnostics and logging data through RESTful endpoints.
  - Offer endpoints for health checks and performance metrics, integrating AI-powered suggestions when discrepancies are detected.

- **CLI & HTTP Integration:**
  - Support a CLI flag (e.g., `--serve`) that initializes the HTTP server to handle incoming requests.
  - Use Nodeâ€™s native HTTP module or a lightweight framework to maintain a single-file implementation consistent with the repository goals.

## Implementation & Testing
- **Single Source File Module:**
  - Implement the HTTP API in a dedicated module (e.g., `src/lib/http_api.js`) that centralizes all HTTP related logic.
  - Ensure seamless integration with existing SCHEMA_MANAGER (for diff operations) and OBSERVABILITY (for diagnostics and logging).

- **Error Handling & Security:**
  - Incorporate robust error handling to manage invalid requests and propagate meaningful error messages through HTTP status codes.
  - Integrate basic security practices such as input validation and environmental configuration for API security options.

- **Documentation & Usage:**
  - Update README and CONTRIBUTING documents with API usage examples, endpoints details, and testing guidelines.
  - Develop unit tests to cover the HTTP endpoints and integration tests for simulating real-world client interactions.

## Value Proposition
By adding the HTTP_API feature, the repository extends its utility beyond CLI and local scripting. It enables automated integration with CI/CD pipelines, remote monitoring, and a foundation for future web-based user interfaces, aligning with the mission to simplify API evolution and foster collaborative development in a streamlined, modern package.
