# OWL_QUERY Feature Specification

## Overview
This feature introduces a new CLI option (`--owl-query`) to simulate querying an OWL ontology stored as a JSON file. When the command is run with `--owl-query` followed by a dummy query string, the tool will output a JSON structure representing query results. This addition aligns with the mission to provide example tools for querying OWL ontologies and enriches the CLI functionality by offering a second, distinct example to the existing `--capital-cities` flag.

## Changes
- **Source Code (`src/lib/main.js`):**
  - Update the CLI argument parser to detect the `--owl-query` flag.
  - Implement a dummy functionality that accepts a query string after `--owl-query` and returns a hardcoded JSON response simulating query results.

- **Test Suite (`tests/unit/main.test.js`):**
  - Add a new test case that invokes the CLI with `--owl-query` and a sample query string, asserting that the output JSON contains the expected `results` key with a dummy result array.

- **Documentation (`README.md`):**
  - Update the usage and examples section to include details on how to invoke the new `--owl-query` flag and interpret its JSON output.
  - Provide example CLI commands and expected output to help users understand how to use the feature.

- **Dependencies (`package.json`):**
  - No new dependencies are introduced as the feature builds on existing functionality.

## Testing
- **Unit Testing:** The test will simulate the CLI call with `--owl-query` and verify that the output JSON contains a key `results` with appropriate dummy data.
- **Manual Testing:** Running the command `node src/lib/main.js --owl-query "SELECT * FROM ontology"` should display a simulated query result in JSON format.

## Documentation
- The README will be updated to include a detailed description of the new flag, usage instructions, and sample output.

This feature adheres to the guidelines in CONTRIBUTING.md and supports the mission of owl-builder by demonstrating an example of querying OWL ontologies.
