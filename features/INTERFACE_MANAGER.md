# INTERFACE_MANAGER Feature

## Overview
The INTERFACE_MANAGER feature consolidates the functionalities of both the command-line interface (CLI) and HTTP service endpoints into a unified module. This feature provides users with flexible, accessible interfaces for interacting with json‑schema‑diff functionalities, including schema export, diagnostics, and diff analytics. It aims to streamline the execution of schema-related operations while preserving error‑free execution and clear documentation in both CLI and HTTP contexts.

## Core Functionalities
- **Unified Command Handling:**
  - Merge CLI commands (e.g., `--export`, `--diagnostics`, `--serve`) into a single, cohesive handler.
  - Implement auto‑detection of flags and subcommands to route operations appropriately.

- **HTTP Endpoint Integration:**
  - Expose key functionalities (such as export and live status reporting) via dedicated HTTP endpoints (e.g., `/export`, `/diagnostics`).
  - Ensure endpoints are secure and adhere to the same error‑handling standards as CLI operations.

- **Robust Error and Logging Mechanisms:**
  - Provide comprehensive error reporting and logging across both interfaces.
  - Facilitate debugging and audit trails through detailed log outputs accessible via either interface.

- **Configuration and Extensibility:**
  - Allow customization of CLI flags and HTTP endpoints through configuration files or environment variables.
  - Seamlessly integrate with existing and future plugins through defined hooks.

## Implementation & Testing
- **Single-Source File Approach:**
  - Develop the INTERFACE_MANAGER in a dedicated source file (e.g., `src/lib/interface_manager.js`) to ensure guidance and traceability.
  - Maintain minimal external dependencies and follow ECMAScript Module standards.

- **Comprehensive Test Coverage:**
  - Write unit tests and integration tests covering both CLI flag processing and HTTP API responses.
  - Use vitest for testing, ensuring all functionality complies with node v20 and ESM standards.

- **Documentation and Developer Guidelines:**
  - Update the README and CONTRIBUTING files with usage examples for both CLI and HTTP endpoints.
  - Include clear instructions for extending or customizing interface behavior.

## Value Proposition
By consolidating multiple operational modes into a single, unified interface, INTERFACE_MANAGER improves the overall developer and user experience. This feature enhances traceability, simplifies debugging, and promotes a modular architecture that aligns perfectly with the repo's mission of enabling collaborative, error‑free API evolution.
