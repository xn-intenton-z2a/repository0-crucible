# INTERFACE_MANAGER

## Overview
The INTERFACE_MANAGER module consolidates CLI commands, HTTP endpoints, plugin integration, and dynamic help capabilities into one unified module. In this update, we enhance its interactivity by integrating a Library API that allows developers to directly import and use core functionalities programmatically. This update further enriches both the user and developer experiences while ensuring smooth evolution toward a comprehensive JSON Schema diff management solution.

## Unified Command, HTTP, and Library API Handling
- **Integrated CLI Commands:**
  - Merges and streamlines existing CLI commands (e.g., `--export`, `--diagnostics`, `--serve`, `--list-plugins`, `--update-plugin`).
  - Auto-detects flags and subcommands to route operations seamlessly.
- **HTTP Endpoint Integration:**
  - Exposes core operations (export, diagnostics, live watch, dry run simulations) alongside plugin management endpoints via standardized HTTP routes (e.g., `/export`, `/diagnostics`, `/plugins/list`, `/plugins/update`).
  - Implements consistent error handling and logging.
- **Library API Integration:**
  - Provides a well-documented JavaScript API that can be imported into other projects.
  - Exposes functions for initiating diff operations, fetching dynamic help, interacting with plugins, and triggering interactive simulations directly from code.
  - Enables developers to integrate JSON Schema diff capabilities without relying solely on CLI or HTTP interfaces.

## Dynamic Plugin Support
- **Plugin Discovery and Management:**
  - Auto-discovers and loads third-party plugins from local directories and community repositories.
  - Retrieves plugin metadata and supports auto-updates of installed plugins.
- **Seamless Integration with Core Functions:**
  - Integrates hooks for plugins to extend or override default schema operations, ensuring security and robustness.

## Enhanced Interactive Tutorial and Onboarding
- **Context-Aware CLI Help:**
  - Auto-generates detailed command usage upon invocation of the `--help` flag or when no arguments are provided.
  - Consolidates descriptions from all integrated functionalities (CLI, HTTP endpoints, Library API, and plugins) for comprehensive guidance.
- **Interactive Onboarding Wizard:**
  - Provides a step-by-step wizard guiding new users through configuration, executing a sample schema diff, and learning plugin management.
  - Offers real-time command suggestions, inline code examples, and dynamic error feedback.

## Implementation & Testing
- **Single-Source Library Approach:**
  - Implement the unified module in a dedicated source file (e.g., `src/lib/interface_manager.js`), maintaining strict separation of concerns and minimal external dependencies.
  - Extend CLI parsers and HTTP routers to include endpoints for triggering the interactive onboarding wizard and Library API functions.
- **Robust Testing:**
  - Augment unit and integration tests to cover CLI flows, HTTP responses, Library API function calls, and interactive wizard scenarios across typical and edge-case usage.
- **Documentation Updates:**
  - Update README and inline documentation with usage examples for CLI, HTTP, and Library API interfaces, including clear examples of programmatic integration.

## Value Proposition
This update to the INTERFACE_MANAGER not only consolidates robust CLI and HTTP interface management but also empowers developers with a dedicated Library API. By enabling direct programmatic access to core JSON Schema diff functionalities, the module supports a wider array of integration scenarios, reduces the learning curve, and reinforces our mission of simplifying API change management for both human users and automated systems.
