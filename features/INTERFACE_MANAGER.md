# INTERFACE_MANAGER

## Overview
This feature consolidates the command-line interface (CLI), HTTP endpoints, and plugin integration into a unified module. It streamlines interactions with json‑schema‑diff functionalities by providing a single interface for executing schema exports, diagnostics, diff analytics, and dynamic third-party plugin operations. This consolidation reduces redundancy and improves maintainability, aligning with our mission to simplify API change management.

## Unified Command and HTTP Handling
- **Integrated CLI Commands:**
  - Merge existing CLI commands (e.g., `--export`, `--diagnostics`, `--serve`, `--list-plugins`, `--update-plugin`) into one cohesive handler.
  - Auto‑detect flags and subcommands to ensure smooth routing of operations.

- **HTTP Endpoint Integration:**
  - Expose both core operations (such as export, diagnostics, live watch, and dry run simulation from SCHEMA_MANAGER) and plugin management endpoints via a standardized HTTP API (e.g., `/export`, `/diagnostics`, `/plugins/list`, `/plugins/update`).
  - Implement uniform error-handling and logging for all endpoints.

## Dynamic Plugin Support
- **Plugin Discovery and Management:**
  - Integrate capabilities to auto‑discover, load, and manage third‑party plugins from both local directories and a community repository.
  - Support fetching plugin metadata, version history, and auto‑update of installed plugins.

- **Seamless Integration with Core Modules:**
  - Provide predefined hooks for plugins to extend or override functionalities in the core schema operations.
  - Ensure that plugins can register custom commands or HTTP endpoints while adhering to established error and security standards.

## Implementation & Testing
- **Single-Source Library Approach:**
  - Develop this unified module in a dedicated source file (e.g., `src/lib/interface_manager.js`), ensuring clear separation of concerns and minimal external dependencies.
  - Maintain ESM standards and compatibility with Node v20.

- **Comprehensive Test Coverage:**
  - Write and update unit and integration tests to cover new CLI flags, HTTP endpoint responses, and plugin interactions using vitest.
  - Document usage scenarios and provide inline code examples to facilitate easy adoption and troubleshooting.

## Value Proposition
By unifying CLI and HTTP interfaces with robust plugin management, the updated INTERFACE_MANAGER enhances developer experience and extensibility. This improves the overall ecosystem while ensuring that all aspects of schema diffing, simulation, and diagnostics are consistently accessible and maintainable.
