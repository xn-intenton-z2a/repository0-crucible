# INTERFACE_MANAGER

## Overview
This module consolidates the command-line interface (CLI), HTTP endpoints, plugin integration, and dynamic help capabilities into one unified module. It streamlines interactions with json‑schema‑diff functionalities by providing a single interface for executing schema exports, diagnostics, diff analytics, dynamic plugin operations, and context-aware guidance. This update refines the existing functionalities and introduces interactive tutorial features to further improve the developer experience.

## Unified Command and HTTP Handling
- **Integrated CLI Commands:**
  - Merge existing CLI commands (e.g., `--export`, `--diagnostics`, `--serve`, `--list-plugins`, `--update-plugin`) into one cohesive handler.
  - Auto‑detect flags and subcommands to ensure smooth routing of operations.
- **HTTP Endpoint Integration:**
  - Expose core operations (such as export, diagnostics, live watch, and dry run simulation from SCHEMA_MANAGER) alongside plugin management endpoints via standardized HTTP routes (e.g. `/export`, `/diagnostics`, `/plugins/list`, `/plugins/update`).
  - Implement uniform error-handling and logging for all endpoints.

## Dynamic Plugin Support
- **Plugin Discovery and Management:**
  - Auto‑discover and load third‑party plugins from local directories and community repositories.
  - Fetch plugin metadata, version history and support auto‑updates of installed plugins.
- **Seamless Integration with Core Modules:**
  - Provide predefined hooks for plugins to extend or override core schema operations.
  - Ensure that plugins can register custom commands or HTTP endpoints while adhering to security and error standards.

## Dynamic Help & Interactive Guidance
- **Context-Aware CLI Help:**
  - Auto-generate command usage instructions upon the `--help` flag or when no command arguments are provided.
  - Aggregate descriptions from all integrated functionalities (CLI commands, HTTP endpoints, and plugin commands) for a comprehensive help output.
- **Interactive Tutorial Mode:**
  - Introduce an interactive, step-by-step tutorial that guides users through common tasks.
  - Provide real-time command suggestions, inline examples, and usage hints based on the current context.
  - Enable feedback mechanisms to help users learn the CLI and HTTP interface quickly.
- **Unified Documentation Delivery:**
  - Integrate dynamic help outputs within both CLI and HTTP endpoints to ensure consistent guidance across the ecosystem.

## Implementation & Testing
- **Single-Source Library Approach:**
  - Implement the unified module in a dedicated source file (e.g., `src/lib/interface_manager.js`), ensuring a clear separation of concerns and minimal external dependencies.
  - Maintain ESM standards for compatibility with Node v20.
- **Enhanced Testing:**
  - Expand unit and integration tests to cover interactive tutorial flows, dynamic CLI help outputs, and HTTP endpoint responses.
  - Document usage scenarios and provide inline code examples to facilitate troubleshooting and onboarding.

## Value Proposition
By updating the INTERFACE_MANAGER, this refined module not only unifies CLI and HTTP interfaces with robust plugin management and dynamic help, but also introduces an interactive tutorial mode. This addition significantly improves the developer experience by providing real‑time guidance and step‑by‑step instructions, ensuring that both new and experienced users can quickly and confidently utilize json‑schema‑diff functionalities.
