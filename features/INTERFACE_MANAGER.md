# INTERFACE_MANAGER

## Overview
The INTERFACE_MANAGER module consolidates CLI commands, HTTP endpoints, plugin integration, and dynamic help capabilities into one unified module. It ensures smooth routing of operations, robust error handling, and an overall enhanced developer experience when interacting with JSON Schema diff functionalities.

## Unified Command and HTTP Handling
- **Integrated CLI Commands:**
  - Merges existing CLI commands (e.g., `--export`, `--diagnostics`, `--serve`, `--list-plugins`, `--update-plugin`) under one cohesive handler.
  - Auto-detects flags and subcommands to route operations without friction.
- **HTTP Endpoint Integration:**
  - Exposes core operations (export, diagnostics, live watch, dry run simulations) alongside plugin management endpoints via standardized HTTP routes (e.g., `/export`, `/diagnostics`, `/plugins/list`, `/plugins/update`).
  - Implements consistent error handling and logging across endpoints.

## Dynamic Plugin Support
- **Plugin Discovery and Management:**
  - Auto-discovers and loads third-party plugins from local directories and community repositories.
  - Fetches plugin metadata, version history, and supports auto-updates of installed plugins.
- **Seamless Integration:**
  - Provides hooks for plugins to extend or override core schema operations, ensuring security and robustness.

## Enhanced Interactive Tutorial and Onboarding
- **Context-Aware CLI Help:**
  - Auto-generates command usage instructions upon the `--help` flag or when no arguments are provided.
  - Aggregates descriptions from all integrated functionalities (CLI commands, HTTP endpoints, and plugin commands) for a comprehensive help output.
- **Interactive Onboarding Wizard:**
  - Introduces a new, step-by-step onboarding wizard designed to guide new users through common tasks such as configuring initial settings, performing a sample schema diff, and registering plugins.
  - Provides real-time command suggestions, inline code examples, and dynamic error feedback.
  - Logs contextual hints and tips based on the current state of user inputs to help accelerate familiarity with the system.

## Implementation & Testing
- **Single-Source Library Approach:**
  - Implement the unified module in a dedicated source file (e.g., `src/lib/interface_manager.js`), maintaining strict separation of concerns and minimal external dependencies.
  - Updates to CLI parsers and HTTP routers now include endpoints for triggering the interactive onboarding wizard.
- **Enhanced Testing:**
  - Expands unit and integration tests to cover interactive tutorial flows, real-time CLI help outputs, HTTP endpoint responses, and the new onboarding wizard.
  - Documentation is updated with usage examples and walkthroughs for both CLI and HTTP integration.

## Value Proposition
This update to the INTERFACE_MANAGER elevates the user experience by combining robust CLI and HTTP interface management with an enriched, interactive onboarding wizard. This wizard not only helps new users quickly acclimate to the toolâ€™s capabilities, but also reinforces compliance with our mission of simplifying API change management and fostering proactive engagement. With dynamic, context-aware guidance integrated directly into both CLI and HTTP interfaces, developers benefit from reduced learning curves and improved efficiency in handling JSON Schema diffs.
