# SCHEMA_TOOL Feature Update

## Overview
This update refines the SCHEMA_TOOL feature to serve as the central engine for JSON schema diffing, validation, and explanation with an even broader reach. In addition to robust CLI management, interactive guided mode, and persistent logging, this update integrates a lightweight HTTP API endpoint. This new capability allows API developers to invoke schema operations remotely, fostering seamless integration with external tools and automated workflows.

## Functionality
- **JSON Schema Diff & Reporting**:
  - Generate human‑readable and machine‑parsable diffs, categorizing changes into additions, removals, and modifications.
  - Produce detailed Markdown reports to clearly outline each schema change.

- **Enhanced AI-Powered Explanations & Caching**:
  - Leverage the OpenAI API to provide plain language explanations for schema diffs.
  - Optimize API usage with an intelligent caching mechanism to reduce redundant calls and latency.

- **Interactive Guided Mode & Schema Validation**:
  - Offer a step‑by‑step interactive mode that provides contextual guidance during schema resolution.
  - Validate JSON schemas against standard meta-schemas, with precise error and warning messages.

- **Schema Persistence & Historical Tracking**:
  - Persist outputs of diff, validation, and explanation operations for audit trails and potential rollbacks.
  - Maintain a comprehensive evolution log recording schema changes over time.

- **CLI Management & Enhanced Dispatching**:
  - Robust command parsing with support for complex flag routing (e.g., --diff, --validate, --explain, --interactive, --diagnostics, --serve, etc.).
  - Automatic help generation and detailed error reporting for invalid commands.

- **HTTP API Integration**:
  - Introduce a lightweight HTTP server to expose endpoints for schema operations. 
  - Endpoints such as GET /diff, POST /validate, and GET /explain allow remote triggering of the tool’s core functions.
  - Seamless routing from CLI commands to HTTP handlers, ensuring consistency in behavior and output.

- **Integration & Logging**:
  - Centralized logging and consistent event tracking across CLI and HTTP API interactions.
  - Backwards compatibility maintained with prior command sets while extending the tool’s integration surface.

## Implementation
- **Module Consolidation & Refactoring**:
  - Update the main source file (e.g., `src/lib/schemaTool.js`) to include HTTP server initialization, leveraging Node’s built-in HTTP modules or lightweight frameworks.
  - Consolidate legacy CLI and diff modules to streamline function calls between CLI and HTTP endpoints.

- **Performance & Error Handling Improvements**:
  - Optimize the caching mechanism for AI responses.
  - Enhance error handling routines to deliver clear, actionable feedback in both interactive and API contexts.
  - Ensure robust persistence with proper rollback and audit logging in case of failures.

- **Testing & Documentation**:
  - Expand unit tests to cover CLI operations, HTTP endpoint responses, diff generation, validation, AI caching, and persistence functionalities.
  - Update the README and CONTRIBUTING documentation to include configuration instructions, usage examples, and detailed endpoint descriptions.

## Value Proposition
The enhanced SCHEMA_TOOL consolidates all JSON schema management tasks into a unified tool that now supports both CLI and remote HTTP API interactions. This not only simplifies API evolution by automating diffing, validation, and explanation tasks but also extends the tool’s integration potential, aligning with our mission to facilitate collaborative and traceable API development.
