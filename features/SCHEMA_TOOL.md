# SCHEMA_TOOL Feature Update

## Overview
The SCHEMA_TOOL feature is the heart of our repository, responsible for managing JSON schemas through diffing, validation, and explanation of schema changes. This update refines the existing functionalities and introduces a new Real-Time Watch Mode that continuously monitors schema changes and provides immediate feedback. This enhancement streamlines API evolution with instant diff displays and integrated validation within an interactive editor.

## Core Functionalities

### JSON Schema Diff & Reporting
- **Diff Generation:** Produce clear, human‑readable, and machine‑parsable schema diffs that categorize changes as additions, removals, or modifications.
- **Markdown Reports:** Automatically generate detailed markdown reports outlining schema changes.

### AI-Powered Explanations & Caching
- **AI Explanations:** Utilize OpenAI API to deliver plain language explanations of schema diffs.
- **Caching Mechanism:** Implement caching to reduce redundant API calls and speed up repeated operations.

### Interactive Guided Mode & Schema Validation
- **Step-by-Step Guidance:** Offer an interactive, guided mode to help users resolve schema issues and understand diff outputs.
- **Validation:** Validate JSON schemas against standard meta-schemas while providing clear error and warning messages.

### Schema Persistence & Historical Tracking
- **Audit Trails:** Maintain a persistent log of diff, validation, and explanation outputs to support rollbacks and historical review.
- **Evolution Log:** Keep a comprehensive log of schema changes over time.

### CLI Management & HTTP API Integration
- **Comprehensive CLI:** Support a wide range of command-line flags (e.g., --diff, --validate, --explain, --interactive, --diagnostics, --serve) to manage operations.
- **HTTP Endpoints:** Expose lightweight HTTP API endpoints such as GET /diff, POST /validate, and GET /explain for remote operations.

### Interactive Schema Editor with Real-Time Watch Mode
- **In-Place Editing:** Enhance the interactive schema editor to allow on-the-fly modifications and immediate revalidation of JSON schemas.
- **Real-Time Watch Mode:** Introduce a new mode that continuously monitors changes in schema files and instantly displays live diffs and validation results. This mode provides developers with real-time feedback, reducing turnaround time for schema adjustments.
- **Seamless Integration:** Ensure that the interactive editor and Real-Time Watch Mode integrate with the existing guided mode, logging, persistence, and API endpoints.

## Implementation
- **Module Consolidation & Refactoring:** Update and refactor the main source file (e.g., `src/lib/schemaTool.js`) to incorporate the new Real-Time Watch Mode while ensuring consistency between CLI and API interactions.
- **Performance Enhancements & Error Handling:** Optimize caching for AI responses and improve error handling routines to provide clear, actionable feedback in both interactive and API contexts.
- **Testing & Documentation:** Expand unit tests to cover the enhanced CLI operations, HTTP endpoint responses, interactive editing, real-time monitoring of schema changes, diff generation, validation, AI caching, and persistence functionalities. Update the README and CONTRIBUTING documentation with detailed configuration and usage instructions.

## Value Proposition
By consolidating all JSON schema management operations—diffing, validation, interactive editing, and now real-time monitoring—into a single cohesive tool, the enhanced SCHEMA_TOOL accelerates API evolution. The new Real-Time Watch Mode provides immediate feedback on schema changes, fostering a more agile development process and improved collaboration among teams.
