# SCHEMA_TOOL Feature Update

## Overview
This update refines the existing SCHEMA_TOOL feature to streamline JSON schema operations with a unified tool that now not only performs diffing, validation, and AI-powered explanations, but also supports interactive guided mode and persistence of operations. By storing detailed reports of schema changes, validations, and explanations, this update enhances traceability, allows historical tracking, and supports rollback and auditing capabilities.

## Functionality
- **JSON Schema Diff & Reporting**:
  - Generate human‑readable and machine‑parsable diffs, categorizing changes into additions, removals, and modifications.
  - Produce comprehensive Markdown reports that detail each schema change.

- **Enhanced AI-Powered Explanations**:
  - Utilize the OpenAI API for plain language explanations of schema diffs.
  - Employ a smart caching mechanism to optimize API calls and reduce latency.

- **Interactive Guided Mode**:
  - Provide a step‑by‑step interactive experience with dynamic suggestions and contextual guidance for resolving schema discrepancies in real time.

- **Schema Validation**:
  - Validate JSON schemas against standard meta-schemas with clear warnings and error messages for deviations.

- **Schema Persistence**:
  - Store schema diff outputs, validations, and AI explanation reports persistently (defaulting to local file storage).
  - Enable historical tracking to support audits and rollback of changes, ensuring a consistent evolution log.

- **Integration & Logging**:
  - Seamlessly integrate with the centralized logging system to capture events from diff operations, AI explanation caching, and persistence actions.
  - Maintain backward compatibility with existing CLI flags and operations.

## Implementation
- **Module Consolidation & Refactoring**:
  - Merge legacy CLI interfaces and diff modules into a single source file (e.g., `src/lib/schemaTool.js`).
  - Introduce a new module (e.g., `src/lib/schemaPersistence.js`) to handle persistence of reports and historical tracking.
  - Integrate robust validation routines using lightweight libraries or custom logic.

- **Performance & Error Handling Improvements**:
  - Optimize the caching mechanism for AI responses.
  - Enhance interactive mode error handling to ensure clear user feedback.
  - Implement persistence with error handling to ensure that report storage does not disrupt schema operations.

- **Testing & Documentation**:
  - Expand unit tests to cover diff generation, validation routines, interactive guided mode, AI caching, and persistence functionalities.
  - Update README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md with usage examples, configuration instructions, and CLI options relevant to persistence.

## Value Proposition
By advancing the SCHEMA_TOOL feature, the repository delivers a robust, all‑in‑one JSON schema management system. The addition of persistence not only bolsters debugging and audit trails but also aligns with our mission to simplify API evolution and foster effective collaboration by providing developers with a comprehensive operational history.
