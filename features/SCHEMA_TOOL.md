# SCHEMA_TOOL Feature

## Overview
This feature consolidates and enhances all schema-related operations into a single cohesive tool. It merges the functionalities of interactive command-line operations, JSON schema diffing, markdown report generation, AI-powered diff explanations with caching, and adds a new schema validation capability. This integrated approach streamlines the management of JSON schema changes and validations, ensuring a seamless experience for API developers.

## Functionality
- **Unified Schema Operations**:
  - **Diff and Reporting**: Perform JSON schema differences with both human‑readable and machine‑parsable outputs. Generate comprehensive Markdown reports categorizing changes into additions, removals, and modifications.
  - **AI-Powered Explanations with Caching**: Use the OpenAI API to provide plain language explanations of schema diffs, with a caching mechanism to store responses and reduce latency and costs.
  - **Interactive Guided Mode**: Introduce a step‑by‑step interactive mode for complex diff operations. Provide real-time, context‑sensitive guidance, dynamic suggestions, and troubleshooting support.
  - **Schema Validation**: Validate JSON schemas against standard meta-schemas to ensure correctness and compliance. Generate warnings or errors for deviations, enhancing the reliability of schema evolutions.
  - **Integrated Logging and Diagnostics**: Leverage the centralized logging system to capture events across all operations. Logs include interactive session events, diff operations, AI explanation caching events, and validation outcomes.

## Implementation
- **Module Consolidation**:
  - Merge existing functionality from the CLI_INTERFACE and SCHEMA_DIFF modules into a unified module (e.g., `src/lib/schemaTool.js`).
  - Integrate new validation routines to check JSON schemas against predefined meta-schemas using a lightweight validation library or custom logic.

- **CLI Enhancements**:
  - Update the main CLI entry point to support new flags such as `--validate` alongside existing flags like `--diff`, `--report`, `--explain`, and `--interactive`.
  - Maintain backward compatibility with previous CLI commands while offering enhanced guidance and validation features.

- **Caching and Logging Integration**:
  - Extend the caching mechanism to include AI explanation responses and validation results when applicable.
  - Use utility functions from the centralized logging library to record operational details and errors for troubleshooting.

- **Testing & Documentation**:
  - Develop comprehensive unit tests covering diff generation, interactive mode, AI explanation caching, and schema validation.
  - Update README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md with detailed usage examples, command-line options, configuration guidelines, and integration instructions.

## Value Proposition
By merging core schema operations into a single, unified tool, the SCHEMA_TOOL feature provides a robust solution for tracking, explaining, and validating JSON schema changes. This enhancement reduces complexity, improves usability, and ensures that schema updates are thoroughly validated and documented, aligning with our mission to simplify API evolution and foster effective developer collaboration.
