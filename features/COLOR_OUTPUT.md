# COLOR_OUTPUT

## Overview
This feature enhances the CLI tool's user experience by adding colorized output to various messages. Using a color library (such as Chalk), the CLI will display different categories of messages in distinct colorsâ€”errors in red, success messages in green, diagnostics in blue, and informational texts in yellow. This makes log interpretation and troubleshooting more intuitive for developers.

## Implementation Details
- **Dependency Addition:**
  - Add a dependency on the "chalk" library in the package.json file to provide the color output functionality.

- **Source File (src/lib/main.js) Updates:**
  - Import chalk from "chalk".
  - Wrap console.error messages with `chalk.red()`, console.log for success with `chalk.green()`, and diagnostic/info messages with `chalk.blue()` or `chalk.yellow()` as appropriate.
  - Ensure that color output is applied consistently across new and existing CLI flags (e.g. when printing diagnostics, export confirmations, memory stats, or errors).
  
- **Test File (tests/unit/main.test.js) Updates:**
  - Update tests that capture CLI output to either strip ANSI color codes or account for the colorized output. Consider using a helper function during tests to remove ANSI escape sequences so that assertions remain stable.
  
- **README Updates:**
  - Update the README under the Features section to include a bullet point describing the new "Color Output" enhancement which improves command line readability with color-coded messages.

- **Dependencies File (package.json) Updates:**
  - Add "chalk" (e.g. "chalk": "^5.2.0") into the dependencies section to enable usage of the colorization functionality.

## Long-Term Direction
This feature is a stepping stone towards a more interactive and user-friendly CLI. In the future, further UI enhancements such as theming or dynamic output formatting could be integrated, and the colorization could be made configurable per user preference.
