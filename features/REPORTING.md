# REPORTING

## Overview
The REPORTING module aggregates outputs from schema diff generation, simulation logs, validation summaries, and recommendation analytics into a unified report. This updated specification enhances the module by integrating automated documentation generation and seamless Git version control integration for changelog automation. This ensures that any changes in schemas are promptly reflected in updated commit logs and documentation, aligning with the mission of simplifying JSON Schema evolution.

## Core Functionalities

### Aggregated Reports
- Consolidate outputs from diff computations, dry run simulations, audit logs, and validations into a single, cohesive report.
- Provide a unified view of all schema evolution activities.

### Multi-Format Export
- Support exporting reports in multiple formats such as Markdown, HTML, PDF, and YAML.
- Allow flexible integration with external tools and workflows.

### Customization Options
- Enable users to define custom report templates.
- Allow selection of report sections (e.g., diff details, validation errors, simulation logs, and AI-driven recommendations).

### Auto Documentation Generation
- Automatically generate detailed markdown documentation and changelogs reflecting schema changes and updates.
- Update documentation in real time during watch mode to continuously reflect the current state of API changes.

### CLI and HTTP Integration
- Implement new CLI flags (e.g., `--generate-report` and `--generate-docs`) to trigger report and documentation generation.
- Expose corresponding HTTP endpoints to facilitate remote triggering and integration in CI/CD pipelines.

### Real-time Updates
- Optionally enable live updates where modifications in schemas, simulations, or validations trigger automatic refresh of reports and documentation.

### Git Integration for Changelog Automation
- Automatically monitor schema changes and trigger Git commits to update changelogs.
- Integrate with the version control system to automatically document and commit changes to report files.
- Seamlessly integrate with CI/CD pipelines to ensure that report updates and Git commits are coordinated, providing continuous documentation and version history.

## Implementation & Testing

- **Source Update:** Extend the reporting module in `src/lib/reporting.js` to incorporate Git integration logic alongside the current auto-documentation capabilities.
- **CLI & HTTP Extensions:** Update argument parsers and HTTP routers to include new flags/endpoints for Git-integrated operations.
- **Testing:** Augment unit and integration tests to cover new scenarios including Git commit triggers, changelog generation, and full-format exports. Ensure both normal and edge-case schema updates are thoroughly covered.
- **Documentation:** Update the README and inline documentation to include usage examples covering the new Git integration features.

## Value Proposition
This enhanced REPORTING module not only consolidates multi-source reports and auto-generated documentation, but also reinforces version control integration. By automating the process of changelog updates and Git commits upon schema modifications, it helps developers keep an accurate, up-to-date history of API changes, improving auditability and collaboration. This upgrade directly supports our mission of simplifying schema evolution and fostering proactive change management.
