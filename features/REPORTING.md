# REPORTING

## Overview
This feature introduces a unified reporting system that aggregates outputs from various operations including schema diff generation, simulation logs, validation summaries, and recommendation analytics. In this update, the module is expanded to also automatically generate up-to-date documentation and changelogs derived from the schema evolution process. The enhanced REPORTING feature now serves both as a comprehensive report generator and an auto-documentation tool to assist developers in understanding and communicating API changes more effectively.

## Core Functionalities
- **Aggregated Reports:**
  - Consolidate information from diff computations, dry run simulations, audit logs, and auto-generated documentation into a single, cohesive report.
- **Multi-Format Export:**
  - Support for exporting reports and documentation in Markdown, HTML, PDF, and YAML formats to facilitate easy sharing and integration.
- **Customization Options:**
  - Allow users to define report templates and choose which sections (diff details, validation errors, simulation logs, recommendation analytics, and auto documentation) to include.
- **Auto Documentation Generation:**
  - Automatically generate detailed markdown documentation and changelogs reflecting schema changes, validations, and simulation outcomes.
  - Update documentation in real time during watch mode to keep API change logs current.
- **CLI and HTTP Integration:**
  - Implement new CLI flags (e.g., `--generate-report`, `--generate-docs`) and expose HTTP endpoints for triggering report and documentation generation.
- **Real-time Updates:**
  - Optionally enable live updates, wherein modifications in schemas, simulations, or validations instantly refresh both reports and corresponding documentation.

## Implementation & Testing
- **Single-File Library Approach:**
  - Extend the existing reporting module within a dedicated source file (e.g., `src/lib/reporting.js`) to incorporate auto-documentation capabilities without affecting the core diff and simulation functionality.
- **Integration with Existing Modules:**
  - Leverage logs and outputs from SCHEMA_MANAGER, including diff computations and simulation data, to generate accurate documentation.
- **CLI & HTTP Endpoint Extensions:**
  - Update CLI argument parsers and HTTP routers to include new flags/endpoints, ensuring consistent error handling and logging.
- **Comprehensive Test Coverage:**
  - Add new unit and integration tests to cover the auto documentation generation process, report formatting, and export functionality. Ensure that tests cover various input scenarios and edge cases.

## Value Proposition
By merging comprehensive reporting with automated documentation generation, this enhanced feature empowers developers with a clear, up-to-date view of all schema evolution activities. It simplifies the process of tracking and sharing changes, supports continuous integration workflows, and aligns tightly with our mission of providing a robust, user-friendly tool for managing JSON Schema changes.
