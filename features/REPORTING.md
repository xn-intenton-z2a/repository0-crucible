# REPORTING

## Overview
This feature introduces a unified reporting system that aggregates outputs from various operations including schema diff generation, simulation logs, validation summaries, and recommendation analytics. The REPORTING module is designed to produce customizable and comprehensive reports in multiple formats (Markdown, HTML, PDF, YAML), helping developers quickly understand the impact of their JSON Schema changes in a single glance.

## Core Functionalities
- **Aggregated Reports:** Consolidate information from diff computations, dry run simulations, and audit logs into a single, cohesive report.
- **Multi-Format Export:** Support for exporting the reports in Markdown, HTML, PDF, and YAML to facilitate easy sharing and documentation.
- **Customization Options:** Allow users to define report templates and select which sections (diff details, validation errors, simulation risks, and recommendation analytics) they want to include.
- **CLI and HTTP Integration:** Implement new CLI flags (e.g., `--generate-report`) and expose HTTP endpoints to trigger report generation, ensuring consistency with the existing command and HTTP interface.
- **Real-time Updates:** Optionally enable live report updates in watch mode, so that any schema change, simulation, or validation automatically refreshes the report.

## Implementation & Testing
- **Single-File Library Approach:** Develop the new REPORTING module in a dedicated source file (e.g., `src/lib/reporting.js`) to ensure clear separation of concerns from the SCHEMA_MANAGER and INTERFACE_MANAGER.
- **Integration with Existing Modules:** Leverage existing logs from SCHEMA_MANAGER (simulation, diff, and recommendations) and incorporate them into the report generator.
- **CLI & HTTP Endpoint Extensions:** Extend the CLI parser and HTTP router to include report generation functionality while maintaining robust error handling and logging.
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Add unit and integration tests to verify the correctness of report formatting, export functionality across multiple formats, and real-time update behavior.

## Value Proposition
By introducing a centralized reporting feature, developers are empowered with a clear, customizable overview of all schema evolution activities. This enhancement not only simplifies API change management but also supports our mission of providing a robust, user-friendly tool for tracking and validating JSON Schema changes.
