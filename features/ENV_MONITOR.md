# ENV_MONITOR Feature - Enhanced Configuration Validator & Interactive Wizard

This feature is responsible for validating critical environment configuration parameters, aggregating telemetry for diagnostic purposes, and now introducing an interactive configuration wizard. It maintains the established validation and telemetry collection mechanisms while adding a new layer for interactive, real-time configuration management.

## Environment Configuration Validation & Telemetry

- **Configuration Validation:**
  - Scans key environment variables (e.g. LIVEDATA_RETRY_COUNT, LIVEDATA_INITIAL_DELAY, CUSTOM_API_ENDPOINTS) for proper numeric and URL formats.
  - Utilizes inline schema validation (powered by Zod or equivalent logic) to parse both environment variables and CLI override inputs.
  - Issues one-time diagnostic warnings upon encountering invalid inputs. Repeated invalid entries are aggregated into a summarized telemetry event.

- **Telemetry Collection:**
  - Aggregates diagnostic events such as non-numeric inputs, applied fallback values, and retry details with exponential backoff.
  - Uses a concurrency-safe caching mechanism (Map) to ensure aggregated reporting for multiple occurrences of the same misconfiguration.
  - Produces detailed, timestamped logs useful for real-time monitoring and post-mortem analysis.

## Diagnostic Reporting

- Generates unified diagnostic summaries via a dedicated CLI command (e.g. `--diagnostic-summary`).
- Exports diagnostic data in JSON or an interactive HTML view if integrated with the web server.

## Interactive Configuration Wizard

- **CLI-Based Interactive Wizard:**
  - Introduces a new CLI command, `--config-wizard`, which launches an interactive session for reviewing and updating configuration settings.
  - Provides immediate validation feedback, using the same normalization and parsing logic already present in the utility functions.
  - Allows users to modify environment values interactively and persist updated configurations to a local configuration file or apply them dynamically for the current session.

- **Web Dashboard Integration (Optional):**
  - Extends the current HTTP server with an additional endpoint (e.g. `/config`), providing a browser-based interface to display current configuration, real-time telemetry, and control elements for updating settings.
  - Enhances operational transparency by allowing users to view diagnostic reports and adjust configuration parameters directly via the dashboard.

## Benefits & Mission Alignment

- **Rapid Troubleshooting:** Quickly identify and resolve configuration errors before they affect live data integration.
- **Operational Transparency:** Combines detailed telemetry with interactive configuration, empowering users to make informed corrections in real-time.
- **Enhanced User Experience:** Seamlessly integrate CLI and web-based management for an improved developer workflow, fully aligned with owl-builderâ€™s mission to deliver live, high-quality ontology data.
