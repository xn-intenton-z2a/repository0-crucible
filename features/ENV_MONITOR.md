# ENV_MONITOR Feature - Enhanced Configuration Validator & Telemetry Report

The ENV_MONITOR feature is responsible for validating critical configuration parameters and collecting telemetry data from environment variables and runtime diagnostics. In this update, the feature is extended to not only validate configurations and aggregate environment telemetry, but also to generate a comprehensive diagnostic report. This report consolidates structured telemetry events, diagnostic logs, and backoff retry details to aid users in troubleshooting and optimizing live data integration.

## Overview

- **Configuration Validation:** Scans key environment variables (e.g., LIVEDATA_RETRY_COUNT, LIVEDATA_INITIAL_DELAY, CUSTOM_API_ENDPOINTS) to check for valid numeric and URL formats. Provides detailed JSON summary reports highlighting discrepancies and suggested fixes.
- **Telemetry Collection:** Captures diagnostic events such as non-numeric inputs, fallback values applied, and exponential backoff details. Each event is logged exactly once per unique normalized input to ensure clarity under high concurrency.
- **Diagnostic Reporting:** Generates a consolidated telemetry report that aggregates recent diagnostic logs and telemetry events. The report can be exported in JSON format and, optionally, rendered as an interactive HTML view via the integrated web server.

## Configuration Validation & Telemetry

- **CLI Integration:** A new CLI command (e.g. `--validate-config`) triggers a full scan of critical environment variables. Results are output as a JSON summary, making it easier for users to quickly identify and correct configuration issues.
- **Telemetry Logging:** Uses a concurrency-safe caching mechanism to log a unified warning for each unique invalid input. Telemetry events include details such as raw input, normalized value, fallback value, and timestamp.
- **CLI Override:** CLI options (e.g. `--livedata-retry-default` and `--livedata-delay-default`) continue to strictly override environment variables, ensuring predictable behavior.

## Diagnostic and Telemetry Reporting

- **Comprehensive Report:** Builds upon existing diagnostic logging by aggregating recent telemetry events and diagnostic logs (including exponential backoff retry attempts and environment validation warnings).
- **Exportable Output:** Users can trigger detailed diagnostic summaries using the `--diagnostic-summary` CLI command. The report provides an at-a-glance view of system health and configurations, aiding in rapid troubleshooting.
- **Interactive View:** Optionally, the report can be integrated into the existing web dashboard for browser-based viewing, promoting immediate access to key operational metrics.

## Benefits

- **Proactive Error Detection:** By validating and reporting configuration mismatches early, users can address issues before they impact live data integrations.
- **Enhanced Troubleshooting:** Aggregated and exportable telemetry reports provide clear, structured insight into diagnostic events, facilitating faster resolution of issues.
- **Operational Transparency:** Integrates seamlessly with the existing diagnostic logging mechanisms to deliver a unified view of system health and configuration accuracy.

This update ensures that ENV_MONITOR not only validates and records critical configuration parameters, but also empowers users with detailed, actionable telemetry reports to maintain robust, reliable live data integration.
