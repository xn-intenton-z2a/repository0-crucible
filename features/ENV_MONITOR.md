# Extended Environment Monitor & Diagnostic Log Analyzer

This update enhances the existing ENV_MONITOR feature by integrating a Diagnostic Log Analyzer. In addition to its current capabilities in environment variable validation, interactive CLI configuration, and real-time telemetry with an HTTP dashboard, this update provides automated log analysis of diagnostic events. The analyzer parses the standardized diagnostic log output to aggregate error counts, categorize issues, and provide actionable recommendations

## Overview

- **Configuration & Telemetry:** Continues to validate and normalize critical environment variables with in-memory aggregation of warning telemetry.
- **Interactive CLI Wizard & Web Dashboard:** Maintains the CLI guided configuration and HTTP endpoints (/config, /diagnostics) for live configuration snapshots and performance data.
- **Diagnostic Log Analyzer:** New functionality that parses diagnostic logs (prefixed with "TELEMETRY:") to:
  - Aggregate error and warning counts over time
  - Categorize common error types (e.g. non-numeric environment inputs, network failures)
  - Present trends and suggested corrective actions
  - Offer a dedicated CLI flag (e.g. `--log-analyzer`) and HTTP endpoint (e.g. `/diag/logs`)

## Implementation Details

- **Single Source Integration:** All enhancements are implemented in the current ENV_MONITOR source file to ensure coherence and ease of maintenance.
- **Log Parsing Engine:** A lightweight parser will read diagnostic logs and extract telemetry JSON payloads. Aggregated data will be displayed as a summary report.
- **CLI & HTTP Integration:** Extend the CLI with a new flag (`--log-analyzer`) for on-demand log analysis, and expose an additional HTTP endpoint for remote diagnostics.
- **User Documentation:** Update README and CONTRIBUTING to reflect the new log analyzer tool, including examples of its CLI usage and integration with diagnostic dashboards.

This consolidated approach maintains the focus on robust live data integration while enhancing system observability and user support through detailed diagnostic insights.
