# ENV_MONITOR Feature Enhancement - Validator, Wizard & Analytics

This update refines the existing ENV_MONITOR feature to not only validate and interactively guide configuration updates but also to aggregate and expose detailed diagnostic and performance analytics. The enhanced feature now integrates three core components:

## Environment Configuration Validation & Telemetry
- **Robust Parsing:** Continues scanning critical environment variables (e.g. LIVEDATA_RETRY_COUNT, LIVEDATA_INITIAL_DELAY, CUSTOM_API_ENDPOINTS) using inline schema validation.
- **Telemetry Aggregation:** Aggregates one-time diagnostic warnings for invalid inputs with enriched telemetry data including raw input, CLI override status, and ISO timestamps.
- **Graceful Fallback:** In non-strict mode, non-numeric values trigger warnings and fallback to defaults or provided fallback values, with suppression options available via DISABLE_ENV_WARNINGS.

## Interactive Configuration Wizard
- **CLI-Based Wizard:** Launches an interactive session (via the `--config-wizard` flag) to review, validate, and update environment configurations in real-time.
- **Immediate Feedback:** Provides real-time validation and normalization feedback with options to persist updates locally or apply dynamically.
- **Optional Web Dashboard:** Extends to a browser-based interface at a dedicated endpoint (e.g. `/config`) displaying current settings and telemetry summaries.

## Diagnostic Analytics & Performance Dashboard
- **Aggregated Metrics:** Collates diagnostic logs and performance metrics (e.g., fetch retry counts, delay intervals with jitter, and success/failure rates) from both environment validation and live data integration operations.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Exposes a new HTTP endpoint (e.g. `/diagnostics`) and CLI command (`--diagnostic-summary`) that offer interactive visualizations and summaries of system health and performance trends.
- **Actionable Insights:** Provides detailed, timestamped analytics to support rapid troubleshooting and continuous performance improvements.

## Benefits & Mission Alignment
- **Enhanced Reliability:** By combining configuration validation with performance analytics, users gain real-time insights and diagnostic context to optimize live data integration.
- **Improved Developer Experience:** The unified interactive wizard coupled with performance dashboards streamlines the configuration and monitoring process.
- **Operational Transparency:** Detailed diagnostic summaries empower maintainers to quickly identify and rectify issues, aligning with owl-builder's mission to deliver live, high-quality ontology data.
