# ENV_MONITOR - Enhanced Configuration and Diagnostics

This feature refines and extends the existing ENV_MONITOR module to provide robust environment variable validation, real-time telemetry, and an integrated web dashboard for diagnostics and configuration.

## Overview

The enhanced ENV_MONITOR combines rigorous environment configuration validation with an interactive CLI wizard and an optional HTTP dashboard. This allows users to instantly detect misconfigurations, view aggregated telemetry, and adjust settings on the fly. This integration aligns with the repository mission by ensuring the tool operates reliably in dynamic, live data environments.

## Configuration Validation & Telemetry

- **Robust Parsing:** Continue to validate critical environment variables (such as LIVEDATA_RETRY_COUNT, LIVEDATA_INITIAL_DELAY, CUSTOM_API_ENDPOINTS) using inline schema normalization and parsing.
- **Enhanced Telemetry:** Log a one-time warning when non-numeric or invalid entries are encountered. Each warning includes detailed telemetry data (raw input, CLI override status, and ISO timestamp) to aid diagnosis.
- **Graceful Fallback:** In non-strict mode, fallback to default or configurable values while suppressing duplicate warnings for the same normalized invalid input.

## Interactive Configuration Wizard

- **CLI-Based Wizard:** Launch an interactive session (using the `--config-wizard` flag) to review and update environment settings in real-time.
- **Immediate Feedback:** Provide validation results and suggestions for instant normalization and error resolution.
- **Persistent Updates:** Option to save changes locally or apply them dynamically at runtime.

## Diagnostic Analytics & Web Dashboard

- **Aggregated Logs & Metrics:** Collect diagnostic logs and performance data (e.g., API retry counts, delay intervals with jitter, success/failure rates) in real time.
- **Web Dashboard Integration:** Expose HTTP endpoints (such as `/config` for current configuration and `/diagnostics` for performance summaries) via the integrated web server, complementing CLI commands like `--diagnostic-summary`.
- **Actionable Insights:** Provide detailed, timestamped analytics with visual cues to empower rapid troubleshooting and system optimization.

## Implementation Details

- **Single Source Integration:** Implement all enhancements in the existing source file to maintain coherence and ease of maintenance.
- **Consistent Logging:** Utilize the enhanced diagnostic logging functions to ensure that all environment-related warnings and telemetry are clearly tagged (prefixed with "TELEMETRY:").
- **User Documentation:** Update README and CONTRIBUTING guidelines to include usage examples for the interactive wizard and web dashboard endpoints.

This consolidated approach ensures that the repository remains reliable and easy to configure, supporting live data integration and advanced diagnostics as required by the project mission.
