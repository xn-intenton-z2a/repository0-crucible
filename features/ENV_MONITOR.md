# ENV_MONITOR Feature

This feature introduces a dedicated environment variable monitoring module that aggregates and exposes telemetry data from environment variable parsing. It adds diagnostic clarity by capturing all non-numeric and misconfigured input events that occur in the repository, and provides a CLI command to review the aggregated data.

## Overview

- **Telemetry Aggregation:** Centralizes all telemetry events (such as unified NaN fallback warnings) originating from environment variable parsing. This helps developers assess recurring misconfigurations.
- **Diagnostic Dashboard:** Provides a CLI command (e.g., `--env-monitor`) that displays a summary report of all warnings and telemetry events logged during runtime. Summaries include counts per environment variable and normalized values.
- **Log Export:** Optionally exports the aggregated telemetry data to a JSON file, enabling further analysis or integration with external diagnostic tools.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Supports a watch mode to update the report in real-time as environment variable issues are detected, assisting during development and debugging.

## Implementation Details

- **Module Creation:** Implement the feature in a new source file (e.g., `src/lib/envMonitor.js`).
- **Data Storage:** Use an in-memory store (such as a Map) to accumulate telemetry events. Provide functions to add new events and retrieve aggregated statistics.
- **CLI Integration:** Extend the main CLI command parsing to recognize a new flag (`--env-monitor`). When invoked, the tool will display the current diagnostic summary from the environment monitoring module.
- **Testing & QA:** Add unit tests to verify that telemetry events are logged exactly once per unique invalid input and that aggregation works correctly. Confirm that the CLI command outputs the expected summary and that log export functionality produces valid JSON.
- **Documentation:** Update the README and CONTRIBUTING documentation to explain the purpose of environment variable monitoring, instructions for use, and troubleshooting guidelines.

## Benefits

- Aligns with the repository mission by enhancing diagnostic capabilities and maintaining high code quality standards.
- Provides actionable insights into configuration issues, reducing the time required to diagnose environment-related errors.
- Encourages better practices in environment variable management, leading to more robust live data integration.
