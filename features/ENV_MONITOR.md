# ENV_MONITOR Feature - Enhanced Configuration Validator, Telemetry Report, and Interactive Config Wizard

The ENV_MONITOR feature is responsible for validating critical configuration parameters and collecting telemetry data from environment variables and runtime diagnostics. In this update, the feature is extended to not only validate configurations and aggregate environment telemetry but also to provide an interactive configuration wizard, enabling users to review, modify, and apply configuration settings at runtime. This comprehensive approach is designed to improve troubleshooting, streamline configuration management, and enhance operational transparency.

## Environment Configuration Validation & Telemetry

- **Configuration Validation:**
  - Scans key environment variables (e.g. LIVEDATA_RETRY_COUNT, LIVEDATA_INITIAL_DELAY, CUSTOM_API_ENDPOINTS) to check for valid numeric and URL formats.
  - Uses Zod-powered or inline schema validation to validate dynamic input from both environment variables and CLI overrides.
  - Provides detailed JSON summary reports, highlighting misconfigured values along with suggested corrections.

- **Telemetry Collection:**
  - Aggregates diagnostic events including non-numeric inputs, applied fallback values, and exponential backoff retry details.
  - Uses a concurrency-safe caching mechanism (Map) to ensure that multiple invalid occurrences are aggregated into a single summarized telemetry event.
  - Captures detailed logs with timestamps to aid both real-time and post-mortem analysis.

- **Diagnostic Reporting:**
  - Generates unified diagnostic summaries via a dedicated CLI command (e.g. `--diagnostic-summary`) and exports them in JSON format or an interactive HTML view if integrated with the web server.

## Interactive Configuration Wizard

- **CLI-Based Interactive Wizard:**
  - Introduces a new CLI command (e.g. `--config-wizard`) which launches an interactive session for users to review current configuration settings, get recommendations based on telemetry insights, and input new values.
  - Provides immediate feedback on the validity of new inputs, using the same normalization and parsing logic as the main environment utilities.
  - Allows users to persist updated configurations either to a local configuration file or to update the environment for the current session.

- **Web Dashboard Integration (Optional):**
  - Enables a browser-based interactive view to monitor system health, view real-time telemetry, and trigger configuration updates.
  - Offers a unified management interface that consolidates live data integration diagnostics with configuration management.

## Benefits

- **Proactive Issue Detection:** Quickly identify misconfigurations before they impact live data integration.
- **Enhanced Troubleshooting:** Aggregated telemetry reports combined with an interactive wizard reduce the time needed to address configuration errors.
- **Operational Transparency:** Users can see real-time diagnostic data and make informed changes through an intuitive interface.

This updated specification aligns with the overall mission of owl-builder by ensuring that the systemâ€™s environment variables are kept in line with the live data integration requirements, while also empowering users with actionable diagnostic data and the means to rapidly correct configuration issues.
