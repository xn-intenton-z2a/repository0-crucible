# Extended Environment Monitor & Diagnostic Log Analyzer with Aggregated Telemetry

This feature updates and refines the existing ENV_MONITOR functionality to further enhance diagnostic capabilities from environment variables and runtime logs. In addition to its present responsibilities—environment variable validation, interactive CLI configuration, real-time telemetry aggregation, and web dashboard endpoints—this update introduces an Aggregated Telemetry Summary component that consolidates NaN fallback events and other diagnostic telemetry.

## Overview

- **Configuration & Telemetry:** Continues to validate and normalize critical environment variables. Invalid inputs trigger a one-time diagnostic warning with detailed telemetry data including the raw value, timestamp, and CLI override status. The aggregated telemetry collection now keeps track of repeated NaN fallback events.

- **Interactive CLI Wizard & Web Dashboard:** Retains the guided configuration and HTTP endpoints (e.g., `/config`, `/diagnostics`) for live snapshots. A new endpoint (e.g., `/diag/summary`) may be added in future iterations for direct viewing of aggregated telemetry data.

- **Diagnostic Log Analyzer:** Enhances log parsing by scanning for logs prefixed with "TELEMETRY:". It aggregates error and warning counts, categorizes common error types (such as non-numeric environment inputs), and produces summary reports with actionable recommendations.

- **Aggregated Telemetry Summary:** 
  - Introduces an aggregated view of repeated NaN fallback events, displaying the count, initial detection time, and associated diagnostic payload.
  - Accessible via the new CLI flag `--diagnostic-summary-naN`, this summary aids maintainers in monitoring recurring misconfigurations and the impact of CLI overrides.

## Implementation Details

- **Single Source Integration:** All diagnostic and telemetry enhancements are implemented in the existing ENV_MONITOR source file to ensure high cohesion and maintainability.

- **Log Parsing Engine:** The diagnostic log analyzer parses standardized log outputs to extract JSON telemetry payloads. It consolidates multiple identical invalid inputs based on normalized values, ensuring that repeated errors are reported only once with an updated count.

- **CLI & HTTP Integration:** 
  - A new CLI flag (`--diagnostic-summary-naN`) triggers the display of the aggregated telemetry summary directly in the console.
  - Existing CLI flags (e.g., `--log-analyzer`) ensure on-demand log analysis, and future iterations may expose a dedicated HTTP endpoint for remote telemetry summaries.

- **Documentation & Testing:** README and CONTRIBUTING documents are updated to reflect the new telemetry summary feature. Comprehensive unit and integration tests (using vitest) verify that aggregated telemetry data is correctly captured, de-duplicated, and rendered without performance degradation.

## Benefits

- **Improved Diagnostics:** Maintainers gain a clear overview of environment misconfigurations by viewing consolidated telemetry data in one summary report.

- **Enhanced Fault Detection:** Early identification of recurring invalid inputs to environment variables helps in rapid debugging and improved application stability.

- **Seamless Integration:** By refining the existing ENV_MONITOR feature, this update retains a unified, single-source implementation with added functionalities focused on actionable diagnostic insights.
