# ENV_MONITOR Feature - Enhanced Configuration Validator

This update extends the existing environment monitoring module to not only aggregate telemetry events from environment variable parsing, but also to proactively validate critical configuration parameters before runtime. The new configuration validator will provide a comprehensive diagnostic report detailing any misconfigurations in numeric and URL inputs, offering early warnings and suggestions for correction.

## Overview

- **Telemetry & Monitoring:** Continues to capture and log non-numeric or misconfigured environment variable inputs with a unified diagnostic message using a concurrency-safe mechanism.
- **Configuration Validation:** Introduces a new CLI command (e.g. `--validate-config`) that scans important environment variables (such as LIVEDATA_RETRY_COUNT, LIVEDATA_INITIAL_DELAY, CUSTOM_API_ENDPOINTS, etc.) and validates them against expected formats. It will generate a JSON summary report highlighting any discrepancies and their recommended fixes.
- **Integration with Diagnostics:** The configuration validator leverages the existing telemetry mechanisms to ensure that invalid inputs are flagged exactly once per unique normalized input. Any warnings or errors are logged with structured details for improved troubleshooting.

## Implementation Details

- **Module Extension:** Update the existing `envMonitor.js` module to include a new function `validateConfiguration()` that checks:
  - Numeric values for environment variables using the existing normalization and parsing routines.
  - Correct URL format for custom API endpoints.
  - Presence of required configuration keys.

- **CLI Integration:** Extend the main CLI parsing in `main.js` to accept a new flag `--validate-config`. When invoked, the tool will run the configuration validation, output a detailed summary report, and optionally export the report as a JSON file for further analysis.

- **Reporting:** The validation report will include the name of each checked variable, its raw and normalized values, the expected format, and a status indicating success or the specific error encountered. This report reinforces proactive diagnostics and assists users in correcting configuration issues before impacting live data integration.

## Benefits

- **Proactive Error Detection:** By validating configuration at startup, users can identify and correct input issues early, reducing runtime errors and unexpected fallbacks.
- **Enhanced User Feedback:** Detailed, structured reports provide actionable insights, improving the overall user experience.
- **Streamlined Troubleshooting:** Consolidating environment monitoring and configuration validation simplifies diagnostics, aligning with the repositoryâ€™s mission of robust live data integration and precise ontology building.
