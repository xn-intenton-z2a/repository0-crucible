# TELEMETRY_SUMMARY

This feature introduces an aggregated telemetry summary that collects and displays diagnostic data from invalid environment variable inputs, especially non-numeric values. The goal is to improve observability of fallback events and provide actionable insights in real time.

## Overview

- **Aggregated Logging:** Collect telemetry events related to NaN fallback warnings. Each unique normalized invalid input is recorded with details such as the raw input value, whether a CLI override was used, and a timestamp.
- **Batched Reporting:** Use promise-based batching to ensure that even under high concurrency, warnings for identical issues are logged only once. The aggregation data is maintained during runtime and can be accessed via a dedicated CLI flag.
- **CLI Integration:** Introduce a new CLI flag `--diagnostic-summary-naN` which outputs a comprehensive report of all aggregated telemetry events.
- **Enhanced Diagnostics:** Enable developers and users to better understand the frequency and context of environment variable parsing issues. This can be used to further refine environment variable handling and user configuration.

## Implementation Details

- Update the inline environment variable utilities to expose an aggregated telemetry API.
- Maintain a telemetry cache that stores unique invalid inputs along with a count and other metadata.
- On invocation of the CLI flag, format and output the telemetry summary in a clear JSON or human-readable format.
- Include unit tests to simulate high concurrency and ensure only one telemetry event per unique input is logged.
- Update documentation in README and CONTRIBUTING to reflect usage and configuration of the telemetry summary feature.

## Benefits

- **Improved Observability:** Users can obtain a clear picture of configuration issues without sifting through multiple log messages.
- **Actionable Insights:** Developers can use the detailed telemetry report to make informed decisions on improving environment variable parsing logic.
- **Seamless Integration:** The feature is integrated into the CLI and single-source file architecture, complementing both the ontology management and monitoring hubs without redundancy.
