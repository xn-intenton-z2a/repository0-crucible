# Telemetry Summary

This feature aggregates and presents diagnostic telemetry data related to environment variable parsing, particularly for non-numeric (NaN) inputs. It collects occurrences of invalid inputs, including details such as raw value, CLI override status, and timestamp, and provides an aggregated summary accessible via the CLI flag `--diagnostic-summary-naN`.

## Overview

- **Aggregated Diagnostics:** Collects telemetry data for environment variable parsing errors (NaN fallbacks) and aggregates occurrences by unique normalized input.
- **CLI Access:** Users can view the summary by invoking the CLI flag `--diagnostic-summary-naN`, which returns a list of telemetry entries with counts and contextual details.
- **Integrated Logging:** Uses promise-based asynchronous batching to log each unique invalid input once even under high concurrency, ensuring efficient diagnostic reporting.

## Implementation and Usage

- **Single Source File Implementation:** The telemetry summary functionality is implemented in the main source file, alongside existing diagnostic and ontology features. It leverages functions like `resetEnvWarningCache` and `getAggregatedNaNSummary` to maintain and return aggregated telemetry information.
- **Configuration:** The feature respects existing environment variable configurations and CLI override values, and integrates with the diagnostic logging system to report warnings with detailed telemetry.
- **Usage Example:**
  1. Trigger invalid environment variable inputs (e.g., setting `TEST_VAR` to non-numeric values).
  2. Run the CLI command with `--diagnostic-summary-naN` to view the aggregated telemetry summary.
  3. Use the output to diagnose configuration issues and improve environment variable handling.

## Benefits and User Impact

- **Improved Debugging:** Provides developers and operators with a clear and concise overview of problematic environment variable inputs, aiding in rapid diagnosis and resolution.
- **Resource Optimization:** By aggregating telemetry data, reduces log clutter and focuses on actionable insights.
- **Enhanced Reliability:** Aids in verifying that CLI overrides and environment configurations are correctly parsed, contributing to overall system robustness.
