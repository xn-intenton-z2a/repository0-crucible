# LIVE_REFRESH Feature Enhancement

## Overview
This feature introduces a scheduled refresh mechanism that automatically rebuilds the ontology with live data at configurable intervals. The goal is to ensure that the ontology remains current by periodically fetching data from verified public endpoints and persisting the updated ontology.

## Implementation Details
- **Scheduler Integration:** Utilize Node’s native scheduling (e.g., setInterval) to trigger the live data refresh. An optional CLI flag, such as `--live-refresh`, can start the scheduler.
- **Configurable Interval:** Allow users to set the refresh interval via an environment variable (e.g., `LIVEDATA_REFRESH_INTERVAL`) with a reasonable default (e.g., 60000 milliseconds).
- **Live Data Refresh:** Each scheduled run will invoke the `buildOntologyFromLiveData` function and, upon success, call `persistOntology` to update the stored ontology file.
- **Robust Diagnostics:** Log detailed diagnostics before, during, and after each refresh cycle. In case of failures, log error messages and employ fallback mechanisms using the static ontology if necessary.
- **Minimal Footprint:** Implement this feature as an extension to the existing CLI tool in a single source file, ensuring it aligns with the repository’s mission of delivering up-to-date ontology data from live sources.

## Benefits & Mission Alignment
- **Continuous Data Freshness:** Automatically keeps the ontology updated with the latest data without manual intervention.
- **Enhanced Reliability:** Regular refresh cycles ensure high-quality and on-demand ontology data, supporting the mission of live and verified public data integration.
- **User Configurability:** Users can easily adjust the refresh timing and control the behavior via environment variables and CLI flags.
