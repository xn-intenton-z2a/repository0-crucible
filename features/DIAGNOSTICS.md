# DIAGNOSTICS Feature

## Overview
This feature introduces a new CLI flag `--diagnostics` to provide real-time system and application diagnostic information. It is designed to help users and developers quickly assess the runtime environment, configuration details, and potential issues during the execution of the owl-builder tool. The diagnostics output supports our mission by aiding troubleshooting and ensuring that the OWL ontology generation workflows are working as expected.

## Implementation Details
- **CLI Integration:** Update the main CLI parser in `src/lib/main.js` to recognize the `--diagnostics` flag. When this flag is provided, the application will gather and display key diagnostic information including Node.js version, environment variables, configuration settings, loaded dependencies versions, and other relevant runtime data.
- **Error Handling:** Include robust error handling to catch any issues during diagnostics generation. The tool should output clear messages if certain diagnostic checks fail.
- **Testing:** Add and update tests in the `tests/unit` directory to verify:
  - The CLI correctly recognizes and responds to the `--diagnostics` flag.
  - The diagnostics output contains expected fields such as Node version and dependency information.
  - Edge cases where diagnostics gathering might encounter errors are handled gracefully.
- **Dependencies:** If needed, update `package.json` to include any lightweight library for gathering system info, though native Node.js modules should suffice.

## Testing
- Write unit tests in `tests/unit` to simulate the `--diagnostics` invocation.
- Ensure the output format is consistent and includes relevant diagnostic information.

## Documentation
- Update the README file to include a new section on the `--diagnostics` command, providing examples on how to use it.
- Document the expected output and explain how this feature assists in troubleshooting and ensuring proper environment configuration.

## Future Considerations
- Consider extending the diagnostics feature to perform more advanced health checks or integrate with logging systems for persistent monitoring.
- Explore real-time diagnostics updates if the application is extended to a long-running service or API mode.
