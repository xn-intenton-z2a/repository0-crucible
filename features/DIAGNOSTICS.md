# DIAGNOSTICS Feature

This feature enhances the CLI tool to provide detailed diagnostics output for debugging and system introspection. When the user runs the command with the `--diagnostics` flag, the tool will output useful information about the runtime environment, configuration, and dependency versions gleaned from the repository's package configuration.

## Overview

- **Purpose**: To help developers and automated systems quickly diagnose and troubleshoot issues by providing a comprehensive snapshot of the application's environment, such as Node version, active environment variables, and dependency listings.
- **Usage**: Users invoke the diagnostics mode by running: `node src/lib/main.js --diagnostics`. The CLI will then print diagnostics information and exit.

## Implementation Details

- **Source File Changes (src/lib/main.js)**:
  - Update the `main` function to check if `--diagnostics` is present in the command-line arguments.
  - If present, compile essential information such as:
    - Node.js version (`process.version`)
    - Current working directory
    - Contents of key environment variables (filtered for sensitive data)
    - Brief summary of dependency versions from package.json
  - Output this information in a clear, formatted manner and exit without further processing.

- **Test File Changes (tests/unit/main.test.js)**:
  - Add tests to simulate CLI invocation with the `--diagnostics` flag. Verify that the output contains key diagnostic headings (e.g., Node version, Working Directory).
  
- **README File Changes**:
  - Update the Usage section with a snippet demonstrating `--diagnostics` usage and describing the output.

- **Dependencies File Changes**:
  - No new dependencies are required for this feature.

## Expected Benefits

- **Improved Debuggability**: Enables developers to quickly gather in-depth information about the execution environment, easing troubleshooting and support cases.
- **Alignment with Mission**: Contributes to the agentic automation by providing self-awareness and transparency of the running system, which is a foundational step for self-improvement and planning features outlined in the mission statement.
- **Incremental Enhancement**: Acts as a precursor to more advanced introspection and logging capabilities that might be integrated in future iterations.
