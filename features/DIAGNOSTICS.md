# DIAGNOSTICS

## Overview
This feature merges and enhances the existing VERBOSE_MODE and SELF_IMPROVEMENT capabilities into a unified diagnostics module. The new DIAGNOSTICS feature introduces both a detailed output mode and self-reporting functionality. When enabled, it provides enriched logging details (timestamps, session identifiers, and extended diagnostic context) alongside self-introspection data including version reporting. This unified approach streamlines troubleshooting, performance monitoring, and overall observability of the agent.

## Implementation Details
- **Verbose Logging:**
  - Introduce the `--verbose` flag to trigger enhanced output. When enabled, console log outputs will be prefixed with ISO-formatted timestamps, session IDs, and additional context derived from runtime diagnostics.
  - Ensure that the enhanced logging does not affect the normal operation of other features and is only activated upon request.

- **Version Reporting & Self-Introspection:**
  - Add the `--version` flag to output the current version of the agent as obtained from the `package.json` file. This flag overrides other processing to quickly deliver version information and exit.
  - In addition, incorporate self-metrics by exposing internal counters (like call and error counts) and other internal states, making them available via a detailed diagnostics report.

- **CLI Integration:**
  - Update the argument parsing in `src/lib/main.js` to handle both `--verbose` and `--version` flags.
  - Ensure that verbose mode complements the existing diagnostic output (such as `--diagnostics` and `--detailed-diagnostics`), providing additional context when needed.

- **Documentation Updates:**
  - Update README.md to instruct users on how to use the new unified DIAGNOSTICS feature. Examples:
    ```bash
    node src/lib/main.js --verbose
    node src/lib/main.js --version
    ```
  - Document that the detailed diagnostics output is designed to support both end-user debugging and internal performance monitoring.

## Testing
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Extend tests in `tests/unit/main.test.js` to cover scenarios where `--verbose` and `--version` are active.
  - Use spy techniques on `console.log` to verify that enhanced log outputs include the expected diagnostic details when verbose mode is activated.
  - Confirm that when `--version` is used, the output strictly reflects the version from `package.json` and bypasses other processing.

## Long-Term Direction
Merging verbose diagnostics with self-improvement capabilities not only simplifies the maintenance of the agentâ€™s monitoring tools but also lays the groundwork for future enhancements. Future iterations might include adjustable logging levels (e.g., INFO, DEBUG, ERROR), integration with external logging services, and more nuanced self-assessment metrics. This aligns with our mission of creating a self-aware, autonomous system that is easy to debug and continually optimizes its own performance.
