# DIAGNOSTICS

## Overview
The DIAGNOSTICS feature is designed to enhance troubleshooting and system integrity by providing detailed run-time information, environment checks, and configuration validations. This module will allow developers and CI systems to quickly initiate a self-diagnostic routine using a dedicated CLI flag (`--diagnostics`) to output comprehensive status reports.

## Features
- **Environment Verification:** Check Node.js version compatibility, dependency integrity, and configuration consistency.
- **Module Health Checks:** Validate connectivity between core modules (SCHEMA_MANAGER and WORKFLOWS) and verify that all integrations are operating correctly.
- **Configuration & Logging:** Provide clear, human-readable logs about system state, executed commands, and potential misconfigurations. Generate actionable recommendations based on the diagnostics output.
- **CLI Integration & Self-Test:** Extend the CLI tool to invoke diagnostics in a single command. Run self-tests that ensure proper module initialization and report on any detected anomalies.

## Implementation & Testing
- **Source File:** Implement the DIAGNOSTICS functionality in a dedicated single source file (e.g., `src/lib/diagnostics.js`) to keep the implementation modular.
- **CLI Update:** Update the main CLI entry point to recognize and delegate the `--diagnostics` flag to the new diagnostics module.
- **Testing:** Write comprehensive unit and integration tests in a new file (e.g., `tests/unit/diagnostics.test.js`) to simulate various scenarios, ensuring the diagnostics output is robust in typical and edge-case environments.

## Value Proposition
Integrating DIAGNOSTICS into the repository enhances the maintainability and operability of the toolchain. Quick and reliable self-diagnostics facilitate faster debugging and smooth integration with automated CI pipelines, aligning with our mission of simplifying the management and evolution of JSON Schemas.
