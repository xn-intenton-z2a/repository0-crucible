# DIAGNOSTICS Feature

## Overview
This feature introduces a lightweight diagnostics module to enhance the overall developer experience by providing real-time insights and troubleshooting guidance. Leveraging data from both the SCHEMA_TOOL and LOGGING features, the diagnostics module will analyze operations, flag potential issues, and assist users in quickly identifying and resolving problems encountered during JSON schema diff operations and validations.

## Functionality
- **Real-time Analysis**: Monitor key operational metrics from schema diff, validation execution, and AI explanation caching events.
- **Error and Warning Reports**: Collect and surface errors, warnings, and performance bottlenecks based on log entries and CLI operations.
- **Interactive Diagnostics Mode**: Support a CLI flag (e.g., `--diagnostics`) that triggers detailed diagnostic reports, including suggestions for resolution and references to documentation.
- **Integration with Logging**: Utilize the centralized logging system to correlate events and generate a comprehensive diagnostic view covering both CLI and potential HTTP interactions.

## Implementation
- **Module Creation**: Develop a single source file (e.g., `src/lib/diagnostics.js`) dedicated to diagnostics functionality, ensuring compatibility with existing modules.
- **CLI Integration**: Update the main CLI entry point to recognize the `--diagnostics` flag, invoke the diagnostics module, and output detailed reports.
- **Testing & Documentation**: Write unit tests to cover diagnostic scenarios and ensure robust error handling. Update both README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md with usage examples and configuration instructions.

## Value Proposition
By adding the DIAGNOSTICS feature, the repository strengthens its overall reliability and user support toolkit. Developers can swiftly pinpoint issues within complex schema operations, ultimately aligning with our mission to simplify API evolution and foster effective collaboration among API developers.
