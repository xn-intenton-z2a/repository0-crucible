# DIAGNOSTICS Feature

This feature adds a new CLI flag, `--diagnostics`, to provide useful runtime and environment diagnostics. When invoked with this flag, the CLI tool gathers and outputs information such as the Node.js version, operating system details, and current environment variables. This helps users verify the running environment and identify potential issues, aligning with the mission of clarity and providing examples for easy troubleshooting.

## Updates in Source File (src/lib/main.js)
- Enhance the `main` function to check if `args` contains the `--diagnostics` flag.
- When the flag is detected, gather diagnostic data including:
  - Node.js version (`process.version`)
  - Process platform (`process.platform`)
  - Process architecture (`process.arch`)
  - Environment variables, if needed (a selected subset for brevity)
- Output the diagnostic data as a formatted JSON object to the console.
- Ensure that if the diagnostics flag is not present, the CLI falls back to its default behavior.

## Updates in Test File (tests/unit/main.test.js)
- Add tests to simulate invocation of the CLI with the `--diagnostics` flag.
- Capture the console output and assert that the output is valid JSON containing at least the Node.js version and platform details.

## Updates in README File (README.md)
- Update the Usage section to document the new `--diagnostics` flag.
- Provide an example command:

  ```bash
  node src/lib/main.js --diagnostics
  ```

- Describe the expected output, emphasizing the usefulness for troubleshooting and environment verification.

## Updates in Dependencies File (package.json)
- No dependency updates are required as the current dependencies support the necessary Node.js functionality.

This feature is designed to be simple, self-contained, and aligned with our mission of clarity in demonstrating public data and example commands, enhancing overall user experience.
