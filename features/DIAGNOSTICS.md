# DIAGNOSTICS Feature

## Overview
This feature extends the existing diagnostics functionality by adding a new flag `--diagnostics-json` to output diagnostic information in a structured JSON format. This allows users and developers to easily parse and integrate diagnostic data into other tools. The JSON output includes system information, configuration details, Node.js version, environment variables, and versions of loaded dependencies. This update builds upon our existing mission to aid troubleshooting and ensure a healthy runtime environment.

## Implementation Details
- **CLI Integration:**
  - Update the CLI parser in `src/lib/main.js` to recognize the new `--diagnostics-json` flag. When detected, the tool should gather the same diagnostic data as with `--diagnostics` and output it as a JSON string.
  - Maintain the current behavior of `--diagnostics` by displaying a human-readable format for backwards compatibility.
- **Error Handling:**
  - Implement robust validation when generating diagnostic data to catch and report errors in JSON conversion. Provide clear error messages if the JSON generation fails.
- **Testing:**
  - Update the tests in the `tests/unit` directory to include cases for both `--diagnostics` and `--diagnostics-json` outputs.
  - Verify that the JSON output is well-formed and includes required fields (e.g., Node version, environment variables, dependency versions).
- **Documentation:**
  - Update the README file to document the new `--diagnostics-json` flag, including usage examples and expected output.
  - Include information on how the JSON output can be used in automated monitoring tools.

## Future Considerations
- Explore extending the diagnostics feature to include more advanced health checks and integration with logging systems.
- Consider adding configuration options to select specific diagnostic data.
