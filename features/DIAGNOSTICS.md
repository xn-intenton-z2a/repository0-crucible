# DIAGNOSTICS

## Overview
This update refines the unified DIAGNOSTICS feature by integrating execution performance metrics into every command invocation. In addition to the existing logging of session details, version reporting, and diagnostic outputs, the CLI will now record the execution time (in milliseconds) for processing each command. This performance metric, stored as the `execTime` property in each memory log entry, aids in self-improvement by providing quantitative feedback on the agentâ€™s operational speed.

## Implementation Details
- **Execution Timing Measurement:**
  - At the very beginning of the main function in `src/lib/main.js`, record the current timestamp using `Date.now()`. 
  - After processing the command and just before recording the memory log entry, compute the elapsed time (i.e. `execTime = Date.now() - startTime`).
  - Append the `execTime` property to the memory log entry alongside properties such as `sessionId`, `args`, and `timestamp`.

- **Diagnostic Enhancements:**
  - Update diagnostic outputs (triggered by flags like `--diagnostics`, `--detailed-diagnostics`, and `--memory-detailed-stats`) to include aggregated performance statistics. For example, calculate and display the average execution time across sessions.
  - Ensure that when performance statistics are reported, they include both the raw `execTime` values per invocation and summary data, such as the average, minimum, and maximum execution times.

- **Testing and Documentation:**
  - **Tests:** In `tests/unit/main.test.js`, add or update tests to assert that each memory log entry now contains an `execTime` property that is a positive number. Test cases should also verify that diagnostic commands output the aggregated performance data correctly.
  - **README Update:** In `README.md`, update the feature description to mention that in addition to logging command details, each invocation now records its execution time. Provide an example showing a memory log entry containing the `execTime` field and update instructions on how to view performance diagnostics.

## Long-Term Direction
By incorporating execution time metrics into DIAGNOSTICS, the agent will have concrete data on the performance of each command. This paves the way for future self-improvement strategies, such as automatically reconfiguring or optimizing slow operations, and adjusting task delegation based on observed execution speeds. Overall, this enhancement aligns with our mission of creating an intelligent, self-improving automation tool.
