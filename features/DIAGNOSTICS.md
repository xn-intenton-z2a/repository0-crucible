# DIAGNOSTICS

## Overview
The DIAGNOSTICS feature provides robust troubleshooting and system integrity checks by outputting detailed run-time information, environment verifications, and configuration validations. It assists developers and CI systems in quickly validating the system state and identifying issues, including enhanced environment variable fallback handling for safer operation.

## Features
- **Environment Verification & Fallback Handling:**
  - Check Node.js version compatibility, dependency integrity, and configuration consistency.
  - Detect and handle environment variables that yield NaN or invalid values by reverting to safe defaults, ensuring more reliable operation under misconfigured conditions.
- **Module Health Checks:**
  - Validate connectivity between core modules (SCHEMA_MANAGER and WORKFLOWS) and verify that all integrations are operating correctly.
- **Configuration & Logging:**
  - Provide clear, human-readable logs about system state, executed commands, and potential misconfigurations.
  - Generate actionable recommendations based on diagnostics output.
- **CLI Integration & Self-Test:**
  - Extend the CLI tool to invoke diagnostics using a dedicated flag (`--diagnostics`).
  - Run self-tests to ensure proper module initialization and report any detected anomalies.

## Implementation & Testing
- **Source File:** Implement or update the diagnostics functionality in a dedicated source file (e.g., `src/lib/diagnostics.js`).
- **CLI Update:** Update the main CLI entry point to recognize the `--diagnostics` flag and delegate to this module.
- **Testing:** Develop comprehensive unit and integration tests (e.g., in `tests/unit/diagnostics.test.js`) to validate normal and edge-case scenarios, including environment fallback handling.

## Value Proposition
Integrating enhanced DIAGNOSTICS improves system resilience and debugging efficiency by automatically correcting common environment misconfigurations. This supports our mission of simplifying API change management and reinforces system stability by providing immediate, actionable insights during development and CI processes.
