# DIAGNOSTICS Feature Update

## Overview
This feature enhances the CLI tool's diagnostics capability by adding a new JSON output mode. In addition to the existing human-readable output provided by the `--diagnostics` flag, the new `--diagnostics-json` flag will return structured JSON containing system metrics such as the Node.js version, process uptime, and memory usage. This structured output is designed for automated monitoring and integration into external systems.

## Implementation Details
- **CLI Integration:**
  - Update the argument parser in `src/lib/main.js` to detect the `--diagnostics-json` flag.
  - When this flag is present, bypass the default diagnostics function and invoke a new function, `diagnosticsJson`.

- **JSON Diagnostics Function:**
  - Implement `diagnosticsJson` in `src/lib/main.js` to gather diagnostic data, including:
    - Node.js version
    - Process uptime
    - Memory usage (via `process.memoryUsage()`)
  - Use `JSON.stringify` to format the gathered data into a JSON string.
  - Include error handling for scenarios when JSON serialization fails, with clear error messages logged.

- **Testing:**
  - Update tests in `tests/unit/main.test.js`:
    - Add a test case to verify that using the `--diagnostics-json` flag outputs valid JSON.
    - Ensure the returned JSON contains key fields such as `nodeVersion`, `uptime`, and `memoryUsage`.

- **Documentation:**
  - Update the `README.md` to include a section on the `--diagnostics-json` flag, complete with usage examples and explanations of the JSON output structure.
  - Reflect these updates in `CONTRIBUTING.md` as guidelines for extending diagnostics functionality.

## Future Considerations
- Further enhance diagnostic output by allowing users to configure which metrics to report via additional CLI options.
- Optimize performance if further diagnostic computations are added in the future.
