# DIAGNOSTICS

## Overview
This update refines the unified DIAGNOSTICS feature to further enhance the agent's self-improvement capabilities by incorporating performance metrics. In addition to detailed log outputs, version reporting, and self-introspection data, the CLI now records the execution time of each command invocation. Every memory log entry is augmented with a new property `execTime` (measured in milliseconds) representing the duration from the start of command processing to completion. Moreover, diagnostic outputs (e.g. from `--detailed-diagnostics` and `--memory-detailed-stats`) now include aggregated performance statistics, such as average execution time across sessions.

## Implementation Details
- **Execution Timing Measurement:**
  - At the very beginning of the `main` function in `src/lib/main.js`, record the start time (using `Date.now()`).
  - After processing the command and before recording the log entry, compute the elapsed execution time (`execTime = Date.now() - startTime`).
  - Attach this `execTime` value as a new property to the memory log entry alongside existing properties (such as `sessionId`, `args`, and `timestamp`).

- **Diagnostic Enhancements:**
  - Update the output for flags like `--detailed-diagnostics` and `--memory-detailed-stats` to include performance metrics. For instance, compute the average `execTime` across all memory log entries and include it in the JSON diagnostics output.
  - Ensure that when statistics are reported (e.g. total count, earliest, latest entries) the new performance metrics are summarized appropriately.

- **Documentation & CLI Integration:**
  - Update CLI usage instructions in README.md to mention that each command now logs its execution time.
  - Provide examples showing that the memory log now contains an `execTime` field and that diagnostic commands will list average execution duration.

## Testing
- **Unit Tests Enhancements:**
  - Update tests in `tests/unit/main.test.js` to verify that each memory log entry includes an `execTime` property that is a positive number.
  - Extend tests for diagnostic flags (such as `--memory-detailed-stats`) to check that the output JSON contains a field for average execution time and that it calculates correctly over multiple entries.
  - Validate that performance metrics are recorded even when commands are executed in rapid succession, ensuring that the timing measurement is robust.

## Long-Term Direction
By integrating execution performance metrics into DIAGNOSTICS, the agent not only logs what commands were executed but also provides quantitative data on how long each operation took. This paves the way for future self-improvement strategies where the agent could automatically adjust its behavior based on observed performance (e.g., optimizing frequently slow operations or alerting for unusually high execution times). This enhancement further aligns the system with the mission of creating a self-aware, autonomous, and continuously optimizing agentic toolset.
