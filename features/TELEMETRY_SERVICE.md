# TELEMETRY SERVICE

The Telemetry Service is a dedicated module for aggregating, batching, and exporting diagnostic telemetry data from owl-builder. It focuses on capturing and processing environment variable anomalies, diagnostic logs, and operational metrics. This feature enhances observability and simplifies debugging by providing a comprehensive view of internal telemetry.

## Overview

- **Aggregated Diagnostics:** Collects and batches warnings from non-numeric environment variable inputs (NaN fallbacks) and other diagnostic events generated during live data integration.
- **Flexible Export Options:** Supports exporting telemetry data in both JSON and CSV formats, enabling easy integration with monitoring tools or manual review.
- **Debounced Batching:** Implements an optimized, debounced flushing mechanism for telemetry events, ensuring efficient logging under high concurrency.
- **CLI Integration:** Introduces dedicated CLI commands (`--export-telemetry` and `--diagnostic-summary-naN`) for real-time telemetry export and review.

## Implementation Details

- **Data Aggregation:** Uses an in-memory cache to aggregate repeated telemetry events (e.g., environment variable anomalies) and prevents log flooding by enforcing a configurable threshold.
- **Export Formats:** Allows operators to choose between JSON (default) and CSV formats for telemetry export, with CSV including clear headers and structured sections for NaN fallback telemetry and a summary of diagnostic events.
- **CLI Commands:** Integrates seamlessly with the owl-builder CLI, providing intuitive commands to trigger telemetry export and view aggregated summaries.
- **Performance Considerations:** The batching mechanism is designed to minimize performance impact by debouncing flushes, ensuring that rapid successive events are consolidated into single actions.

## Usage & Benefits

- **Enhanced Debugging:** Operators can quickly inspect detailed telemetry logs to diagnose issues with environment variable parsing and live data integration.
- **Operational Transparency:** Real-time telemetry export and summary features give developers a transparent view of internal operations, aiding in proactive troubleshooting.
- **Easy Integration:** The modular design allows the Telemetry Service to be maintained independently, ensuring compatibility with the overall mission of robust live data processing.
