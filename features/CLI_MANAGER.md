# CLI_MANAGER Feature Update

## Overview
The CLI_MANAGER feature is central to managing all command line interactions for json-schema-diff. In this update the feature is further refined to enhance dynamic documentation generation, improved argument parsing with interactive error feedback, and tighter integration with both SCHEMA_MANAGER and WEB_SERVICE functionalities. This upgrade ensures that the repository remains user‑friendly, well‑documented, and aligned with our mission to simplify JSON Schema evolution and promote error‑free, collaborative development.

## Core Functionalities
- **Unified Command Parsing & Dispatch:**
  - Continue to consolidate CLI flags (e.g., --serve, --diagnostics, --refresh, --build-enhanced, --validate-schema, --explain-change) into a coherent, subcommand-based interface.
  - Implement advanced argument validation, interactive suggestions, and informative error messages to guide users in proper usage.
  - Maintain backward compatibility and seamless dispatch to underlying modules such as SCHEMA_MANAGER and WEB_SERVICE.

- **Enhanced Dynamic Help & Documentation:**
  - Dynamically generate context-aware help messages and usage examples by extracting current command definitions and available options.
  - Auto-update Markdown documentation to reflect the latest CLI commands and HTTP endpoint integrations, ensuring consistency with the repository README and CONTRIBUTING guidelines.
  - Introduce inline tips and interactive prompts in case of argument conflicts to streamline the user experience.

- **Integrated Diagnostics & Interactive Feedback:**
  - Provide immediate diagnostic outputs for CLI commands that interface with error logging and asynchronous notifications.
  - Enhance command execution feedback by clearly reporting both successful and error states, linking back to the related documentation sections.
  - Offer a preview mode that allows users to see the impact of commands before fully executing them.

## Implementation & Testing
- **Single-File Consolidation:**
  - Implement the improved CLI_MANAGER in a single source file (e.g., `src/lib/cli_manager.js`) while ensuring that all enhancements are modular and maintainable.
  - Update the main CLI entry point (`src/lib/main.js`) to delegate to CLI_MANAGER and forward new flags as needed, ensuring minimal disruption to existing workflows.

- **Robust Error Handling & Unit Testing:**
  - Ensure comprehensive error management, including handling of invalid arguments, missing parameters, and conflicts between options.
  - Enhance the existing test suites with additional unit and integration tests, particularly around dynamic documentation generation and interactive feedback features.

- **Seamless Integration:**
  - Maintain complete backward compatibility with previous command formats while introducing new user-centric features.
  - Synchronize documentation updates in real-time with CLI command changes so that developers always have the latest usage information at hand.

## Value Proposition
By refining the CLI_MANAGER feature, the repository enhances user engagement and reduces the learning curve. Dynamic help messages and tighter integration with remote service endpoints lead to a more intuitive and error‑resilient CLI tool. This update further aligns with our mission to simplify API evolution, strengthen developer collaboration, and promote a robust, user‑friendly operational interface.
