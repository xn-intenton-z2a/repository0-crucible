# CLI_MANAGER Feature

## Overview
The CLI_MANAGER feature unifies and streamlines all CLI commands and flags. It handles command parsing, dispute resolution between conflicting options, and dispatches commands to underlying operations in the repository. In this update, the CLI_MANAGER is enhanced to dynamically generate user documentation for both CLI usage and HTTP endpoints, ensuring that documentation remains consistent with current functionalities.

## Core Functionalities
- **Unified Command Parsing:**
  - Consolidates various CLI flags (e.g., --serve, --diagnostics, --refresh, --build-enhanced) into a coherent, subcommand-based interface.
  - Implements robust argument validation and error messaging to guide users in correct usage.

- **Dynamic Help & Usage Documentation:**
  - Generates context-aware help messages detailing available commands and options, with usage examples and inline documentation.
  - Auto-updates user documentation (Markdown) based on modifications in CLI commands and HTTP endpoints.
  - Integrates with the repository's README and CONTRIBUTING guidelines to offer up-to-date operational instructions.

- **Seamless Integration:**
  - Dispatches commands to corresponding modules including SCHEMA_MANAGER and WEB_SERVICE, preserving backward compatibility with the legacy CLI entry point.
  - Supports extended functionality such as generating diagnostic outputs and real-time feedback.

## Implementation & Testing
- **Single-File Module:**
  - The CLI_MANAGER is implemented in a single source file (e.g., `src/lib/cli_manager.js`) encapsulating all command parsing, dynamic documentation generation, and dispatch logic.
  - Updates to the main CLI entry point in `src/lib/main.js` delegate interactions to CLI_MANAGER.

- **Robust Error Handling & Validation:**
  - Full error handling for invalid arguments, missing parameters, and unsupported commands.
  - Enhances unit and integration tests to cover dynamic documentation generation along with parsing logic.

- **Dynamic Documentation Generation:**
  - Incorporates a submodule within CLI_MANAGER to extract command definitions and inline usage details, generating (or updating) a Markdown documentation file.
  - Ensures that any changes to endpoints or command flags are automatically reflected in the repository's documentation.

## Value Proposition
By unifying command parsing and automatically synchronizing user documentation with code changes, the updated CLI_MANAGER feature further simplifies user interactions. This dynamic approach minimizes documentation drift, eases onboarding, and aligns with our mission to simplify API evolution and promote error-free, collaborative development.
