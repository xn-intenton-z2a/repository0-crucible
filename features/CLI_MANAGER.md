# CLI_MANAGER Feature

## Overview
The CLI_MANAGER feature introduces an enhanced command line interface that unifies and streamlines all available commands and flags in the repository. This feature improves usability by parsing complex CLI arguments, providing dynamic help information, and mapping commands to underlying operations such as schema diff generation, interactive editing, persistence, and remote diagnostics. 

## Core Functionalities
- **Unified Command Parsing:**
  - Consolidate various CLI flags (e.g., --serve, --diagnostics, --refresh, --build-enhanced) into a cleaner, subcommand-based interface.
  - Implement robust argument validation and error messaging to guide users in correct usage.

- **Dynamic Help & Usage Documentation:**
  - Generate context-aware help messages that detail available commands and options, integrating examples from the underlying schema and web service functionalities.
  - Provide inline documentation and usage examples for both developers and end users.

- **Seamless Integration:**
  - Integrate with existing features such as SCHEMA_MANAGER and WEB_SERVICE by dispatching commands to the corresponding modules.
  - Work in tandem with current CLI entry point (src/lib/main.js) for backward compatibility.

## Implementation & Testing
- **Single-File Module:**
  - Implement the CLI_MANAGER as a single source file (e.g., `src/lib/cli_manager.js`) encapsulating all command parsing and dispatch logic.
  - Modify `src/lib/main.js` to defer CLI interactions to the CLI_MANAGER module.

- **Error Handling & Validation:**
  - Ensure robust error handling for invalid arguments, missing parameters, and unsupported commands.
  - Write unit and integration tests to cover parsing logic, help message generation, and command dispatch scenarios.

- **Documentation & Examples:**
  - Update the README and CONTRIBUTING files with detailed usage instructions and sample command invocations.
  - Include guidelines on how to extend CLI commands in the future.

## Value Proposition
By centralizing CLI management, the CLI_MANAGER feature simplifies user interactions and reduces the learning curve associated with multiple disparate command flags. This streamlined approach enhances user experience and aligns with our mission to simplify API evolution and promote efficient, errorâ€‘free development.
