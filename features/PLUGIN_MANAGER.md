# PLUGIN_MANAGER Feature Enhancement

## Overview
The PLUGIN_MANAGER now not only offers dynamic plugin loading and integration with core modules, but also introduces a new dimension: a Community Plugin Repository. This extension empowers users to easily browse, fetch, and auto-integrate third‑party plugins from an external registry, promoting a vibrant ecosystem of extensions to enhance json‑schema‑diff functionalities.

## Core Functionalities
- **Dynamic Plugin Loading:**
  - Auto‑discover and load plugins from both local directories and a remote community repository.
  - Support synchronous and asynchronous plugins, extending export, validation, diff reporting, and logging operations.
  - Provide clear error messages and sandboxing measures to ensure safe integration.

- **Community Plugin Repository:**
  - Integrate a remote repository interface to search and retrieve community-developed plugins.
  - Allow users to preview plugin details, version history, and compatibility notes before installation.
  - Enable auto‑update and verification of installed plugins to maintain stability and security.

- **Seamless Integration with Core Modules:**
  - Offer well‑defined hooks for plugins to extend functionalities in SCHEMA_MANAGER and INTERFACE_MANAGER.
  - Provide APIs and configuration options for plugins to register custom commands, HTTP endpoints, or diff logic.

- **Developer Experience & Documentation:**
  - Include comprehensive guidelines and inline examples for writing, integrating, and updating plugins.
  - Auto‑generate documentation for installed plugins that complies with CONTRIBUTING.md standards.

## Implementation & Testing
- **Single‑File Library Approach:**
  - Enhance the existing module (e.g., `src/lib/plugin_manager.js`) to incorporate remote repository interactions.
  - Isolate the community repository code, making it easily maintainable and extendable.

- **Robust Error and Update Handling:**
  - Implement clear error handling for remote fetch failures, plugin mismatches, and update conflicts.
  - Develop unit and integration tests that cover both local and remote plugin workflows.

- **CLI and HTTP Integration:**
  - Expose commands via CLI flags (e.g., `--list-plugins`, `--update-plugin`) and HTTP endpoints (e.g., `/plugins/list`, `/plugins/update`) for managing plugins.
  - Ensure uniform error reporting and logging across these interfaces.

## Value Proposition
Enhancing PLUGIN_MANAGER with a Community Plugin Repository accelerates ecosystem growth by simplifying access to a wide range of community‑developed extensions. This not only enriches the core functionalities of json‑schema‑diff but also solidifies the mission of enabling collaborative, error‑free API evolution through modular, dynamic integration.
