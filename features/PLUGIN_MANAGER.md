# PLUGIN_MANAGER Feature

## Overview
The PLUGIN_MANAGER feature introduces a lightweight, extensible plugin system for json‑schema‑diff. This addition empowers users and third‑party developers to create custom modules that can extend the core capabilities of schema diffing, export, and audit reporting. By providing well‑defined hooks and dynamic loading mechanisms, PLUGIN_MANAGER aims to foster community contributions and tailor the tool’s functionality to diverse project needs.

## Core Functionalities
- **Dynamic Plugin Loading:**
  - Automatically discover and load plugins from a specified directory or via configuration.
  - Support both synchronous and asynchronous plugins that can extend export, validation, and reporting functions.

- **Seamless Integration with Core Modules:**
  - Allow plugins to hook into operations of the SCHEMA_MANAGER and the new INTERFACE_MANAGER (merged from existing CLI_MANAGER and WEB_SERVICE).
  - Provide APIs for plugins to register commands, HTTP endpoints, or even custom diff logic.

- **Configuration & Security:**
  - Offer a simple configuration interface to enable or disable plugins, set priority, and customize behavior.
  - Implement sandboxing measures to ensure that plugins run safely without compromising the core system.

- **Developer Experience & Documentation:**
  - Include detailed guidelines and examples for writing and integrating plugins.
  - Support auto‑generation of documentation for installed plugins, ensuring consistency with CONTRIBUTING.md standards.

## Implementation & Testing
- **Single‑File Library:**
  - Develop PLUGIN_MANAGER as a standalone module (e.g., `src/lib/plugin_manager.js`) that can be easily integrated into the main application.
  - Maintain simplicity ensuring all plugin operations occur within this dedicated source file.

- **Robust Error Handling:**
  - Provide clear error messages for plugin load failures and safeguard against misbehaving plugins.
  - Implement extensive unit tests and integration tests to validate plugin discovery, registration, and execution.

- **Integration with Merged Interface:**
  - Ensure that the plugin hooks seamlessly interface with the consolidated INTERFACE_MANAGER, which merges functionalities of the previous CLI_MANAGER and WEB_SERVICE.

## Value Proposition
The PLUGIN_MANAGER not only extends the functionality of json‑schema‑diff but also creates an ecosystem for community‑driven enhancements. It simplifies the process of tailoring the tool for various workflows—from bespoke export formats to custom schema validations—and reinforces our mission of simplifying API evolution through modular, error‑free development.
