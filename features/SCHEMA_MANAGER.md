# SCHEMA_MANAGER Feature

## Overview
This feature consolidates the core capabilities of managing JSON Schema evolution by merging functionalities from the existing PERSISTENCE and SCHEMA_TOOL features. It provides a unified toolkit for diff generation, interactive editing, persistent storage (with rollback support), and dynamic reporting. This consolidation not only simplifies the user experience but also aligns with our mission to simplify API evolution and foster collaborative development.

## Core Functionalities
- **Diff Generation & Reporting:**
  - Generate clear and categorized diffs (additions, removals, modifications) in both markdown and HTML formats.
  - Auto-generate dynamic reports with collapsible sections and filtering options to aid review.

- **Persistence & Rollback:**
  - Persist JSON Schema diff outputs along with a versioned audit trail.
  - Enable rollback operations to revert to previous stable states, with confirmation prompts and integrity checks.

- **Interactive Editing & Live Synchronization:**
  - Incorporate an interactive schema editor with real-time monitoring and guided assistance to resolve issues.
  - Support live synchronization via WebSockets to allow multiple users to collaborate seamlessly.

- **AI-Powered Explanations & Caching:**
  - Leverage the OpenAI API to provide plain-language explanations for schema changes, utilizing caching to optimize performance.

## Implementation & Testing
- **Single Source File Module:**
  - Implement the consolidated logic within a dedicated module (e.g., `src/lib/schema_manager.js`) ensuring all functionalities (diff, persistence, interactive editing) are maintained.
  
- **CLI & HTTP Integration:**
  - Update the main CLI entry point to support new flags specific to schema management, such as `--merge-schema` for diff and persistence operations.
  
- **Robust Error Handling & Testing:**
  - Ensure comprehensive error handling throughout the module.
  - Develop unit and integration tests to cover all aspects including rollback, live sync, and AI explanation caching.

## Value Proposition
By unifying schema diffing, persistent audit trails, rollback mechanisms, and real-time interactive editing into a single feature, SCHEMA_MANAGER streamlines the management of JSON Schema evolution. This consolidation delivers a more cohesive tool for developers, reducing code redundancy and maintenance overhead while enhancing reliability and team collaboration.
