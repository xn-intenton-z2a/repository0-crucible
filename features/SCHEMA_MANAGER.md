# SCHEMA_MANAGER

## Overview
This update further refines the core engine responsible for managing JSON Schema evolution. In addition to the existing capabilities like versioning, diff generation, interactive simulation (REPL mode), and integration with CLI/HTTP endpoints, this revision sharpens the focus on AI-driven risk assessment and enhanced developer feedback. The changes are implemented in a single source file with comprehensive unit and integration tests. This aligns with our mission to simplify API change management by streamlining schema evolution and providing actionable insights.

## Core Functionalities
- **Diff Generation & Reporting**
  - Generate detailed diffs capturing additions, modifications, and removals in JSON Schemas.
  - Produce reports in multiple formats including Markdown, HTML, PDF, and YAML.

- **Persistence, Rollback & Auditing**
  - Maintain versioned schema histories with rollback support and audit logs.
  - Utilize flags like `--merge-persist` for safe consolidation of version histories.

- **Interactive Simulation & REPL Mode**
  - Launch a REPL environment via the `--repl` flag for real-time schema change simulation.
  - Support sandbox simulations with immediate feedback including diff previews and risk assessment.

- **Validation, Explanations & Auto-Generation**
  - Integrate Zod for strict validation along with plain-language AI explanations for errors.
  - Automatically generate baseline JSON Schema definitions from sample objects with interactive previews.
  - Support export operations through CLI flags and HTTP endpoints.

## Enhanced AI-DRIVEN RISK ASSESSMENT
- **Proactive Risk Scoring**
  - Leverage AI (e.g., OpenAI integration) to assign risk scores to schema modifications based on defined risk factors.
  - Provide real-time risk evaluation during interactive sessions and CI/CD pipelines.

- **Actionable Insights & Recommendations**
  - Offer instant, actionable recommendations to mitigate potential schema risks during modifications.
  - Embed risk insights seamlessly into both REPL mode and automated workflows using the new `--risk-assess` flag.

## Interactive Diff Visualization & Live Updates
- Graphically enhance diff outputs with visual cues (color coding, animations, zoom, and panning).
- Enable realâ€‘time live updates that automatically trigger validations, diff generation, and report refreshes when schema files change.

## Implementation & Testing
- **Single-File Extension**: Extend the main source file (e.g., `src/lib/schema_manager.js`) to integrate all new functionalities without disrupting existing features.
- **CLI & HTTP Integration**: Update the CLI parser to support additional flags (`--risk-assess`, enhanced `--repl`) and ensure consistent behavior across endpoints.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Augment the test suite to cover new risk assessment flows, interactive simulations, and performance benchmarks.

## Value Proposition
This enhanced SCHEMA_MANAGER provides developers with an advanced, unified tool for managing JSON Schema evolution. By combining reliable schema diffing, interactive simulation, and AI-driven risk assessment in a single, maintainable repository, it delivers immediate, actionable insights that reduce the risk of breaking changes and streamline API evolution.
