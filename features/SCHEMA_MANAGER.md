# SCHEMA_MANAGER

## Overview
The SCHEMA_MANAGER feature is the central module for managing the evolution of JSON Schemas. It provides a comprehensive suite of tools for diff generation, interactive simulations, automated risk assessment, and now enhanced linting for best practices. This integrated approach empowers API developers to understand, simulate, and remediate schema changes effectively.

## Core Functionalities
- **Diff Generation & Reporting**
  - Analyze changes between schema versions and capture additions, modifications, and removals.
  - Support for exporting detailed reports in various formats (Markdown, HTML, PDF, YAML).

- **Persistence, Rollback & Auditing**
  - Maintain a versioned history of schema modifications with full rollback capabilities.
  - Utilize flags like `--merge-persist` for safe consolidation of version histories.

- **Interactive Simulation & REPL Mode**
  - Launch a sandboxed REPL environment using the `--repl` flag for real‑time simulation of schema changes with immediate diff previews.
  - Incorporate preliminary risk evaluations during interactive sessions.

- **Validation, Explanations & Auto-Generation**
  - Integrate Zod for strict validation, supplemented by plain-language explanations generated via AI.
  - Automatically generate baseline JSON Schema definitions from sample objects, with live previews and export capabilities via CLI and HTTP endpoints.

- **Enhanced AI-Driven Risk Assessment & Patch Suggestions**
  - Leverage AI to assign risk scores based on schema risk factors and suggest actionable remediation steps, including sample code patches.
  - Support integration of patch suggestions into both interactive sessions and CI/CD pipelines using the `--risk-assess` flag.

- **Interactive Diff Visualization & Live Updates**
  - Enhance diff outputs with visual cues, animations, and interactive features such as zoom and panning.
  - Enable real‑time validations, diff re-generation, risk assessments, and patch refreshes triggered by schema file changes.

- **Linting & Static Analysis**
  - **Overview:** Introduce a new linting module within the SCHEMA_MANAGER to analyze JSON Schema structures for adherence to best practices.
  - **Features:**
    - Automatically check schema files for common pitfalls, inconsistencies, and deprecated patterns.
    - Provide inline warnings and detailed suggestions to maintain high-quality, consistent schema definitions.
    - Support execution via a dedicated CLI flag (`--lint`), and integrate checks into interactive sessions.
    - Generate a summary report of linting issues, supporting various export formats for developer review.

## Implementation & Testing
- **Single-File Extension:** Update the main schema management source (e.g. `src/lib/schema_manager.js`) to integrate the linting module without impacting existing functionalities.
- **CLI & HTTP Integration:** Extend the CLI parser to incorporate the new `--lint` flag and expose linting summaries via HTTP endpoints.
- **Comprehensive Test Coverage:** Augment unit and integration tests to cover the linting module. Ensure tests account for various schema input scenarios and edge cases.
- **Documentation & Usage:** Update the repository’s README and documentation to illustrate usage examples, including inline code and CLI invocations for linting.

## Value Proposition
The updated SCHEMA_MANAGER now not only facilitates schema diffing, risk assessment, and interactive simulations, but also enforces schema quality through automated linting. This enhancement streamlines the development workflow, reduces potential errors, and aligns with our mission of simplifying API change management by ensuring robust, high-quality schema definitions.
