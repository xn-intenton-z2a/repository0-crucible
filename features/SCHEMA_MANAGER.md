# SCHEMA_MANAGER Feature Enhancement

## Overview
This update to the SCHEMA_MANAGER feature builds on its robust capabilities for managing JSON Schema evolution by introducing a new export functionality. In addition to diff generation, versioned persistence, interactive editing, and analytics, the enhanced feature will allow users to export JSON Schemas, diff reports, and analytical summaries in multiple formats. This export capability streamlines the process of sharing and archiving schema evolution data, further supporting API teams in collaborative and error‑free development.

## Core Functionalities
- **Diff Generation & Reporting:**
  - Generate detailed diffs outlining schema additions, modifications, and removals.
  - Auto‑generate dynamic reports in markdown, HTML, and now additional export formats.

- **Persistence, Rollback & Auditing:**
  - Maintain versioned schema histories with robust rollback and audit trails.

- **Interactive Editing & Live Synchronization:**
  - Facilitate real‑time schema editing and collaborative guidance.

- **Validation & Enhanced Explanations:**
  - Use Zod for schema validation and deliver AI‑powered, plain‑language explanations.

- **Auto Schema Generation:**
  - Create baseline JSON Schema definitions from sample JSON objects with an interactive preview.

- **Diff Analytics:**
  - Aggregate historical diff data to provide statistical insights and trend reports.

- **Export & Sharing (New Capability):**
  - Support exporting JSON Schemas, diff reports, and analytics summaries into various formats including PDF, YAML, Markdown, and HTML.
  - Integrate export functions with CLI flags (e.g., `--export`) and provide dedicated HTTP endpoints (e.g., `/export`) within the unified web service.
  - Allow customizable export templates to match team documentation standards and sharing requirements.

## Implementation & Testing
- **Single-File Consolidation:**
  - Enhance the existing `src/lib/schema_manager.js` to include export functionality, ensuring all operations remain in a single source file.

- **CLI and Web Service Integration:**
  - Update the main CLI entry point to handle new export flags and ensure seamless orchestration with the web service module if necessary.

- **Robust Error Handling & Testing:**
  - Implement comprehensive error management across export operations.
  - Expand unit and integration tests to cover export scenarios, ensuring compatibility with existing functionalities and reliability under diverse use cases.

## Value Proposition
By integrating export capabilities into the SCHEMA_MANAGER, developers gain a powerful tool for producing standardized, shareable documentation of schema changes and analytics. This improvement not only enhances traceability and auditing but also furthers our mission of simplifying API evolution and promoting collaborative, error‑free development.
