# SCHEMA_MANAGER Feature Enhancement

## Overview
This enhancement builds upon the robust JSON Schema management capabilities by maintaining core functions such as diff generation, versioned persistence, interactive editing, validation, export, and documentation generation. In addition to Recommendation Analytics, Interactive Diff Visualization, and Live Watch Mode, this update introduces a new Dry Run Simulation mode. This mode allows developers to safely simulate and preview schema changes without committing modifications, thereby reducing risk during development.

## Core Functionalities
- **Diff Generation & Reporting:**
  - Generate detailed diffs outlining schema changes including additions, modifications, and removals.
  - Auto‑generate dynamic reports in Markdown, HTML, PDF, YAML, and customizable formats.

- **Persistence, Rollback & Auditing:**
  - Maintain versioned schema histories with robust rollback capabilities and comprehensive audit trails.

- **Interactive Editing & Synchronization:**
  - Enable real‑time editing of JSON Schemas with collaborative guidance and live synchronization across tools.

- **Validation & AI‑Powered Explanations:**
  - Utilize Zod for rigorous schema validation and provide plain‑language, AI‑enhanced explanations of schema differences.

- **Auto Schema Generation & Export:**
  - Generate baseline JSON Schema definitions from sample JSON objects with interactive previews.
  - Support various export formats via CLI flags (e.g., `--export`) and dedicated HTTP endpoints (e.g., `/export`).

- **Documentation Generation:**
  - Automatically create comprehensive, human‑readable documentation from schema diffs and export data, with options for customization via document templates.

- **Extended Recommendation Analytics:**
  - Analyze historical diff data to identify trends, recurring issues, and potential improvements in API design.
  - Provide a CLI flag (e.g., `--recommend`) and HTTP endpoint (e.g., `/recommend`) to trigger recommendation analysis.
  - Integrate recommendation outputs with existing diff analytics to give actionable insights.

- **Interactive Diff Visualization:**
  - Graphically render schema diffs highlighting changes through color coding and animations.
  - Allow zooming, panning, and detailed tooltips for inspecting specific changes.
  - Support CLI flag (e.g., `--visualize`) and HTTP endpoint (e.g., `/visualize`).

- **Live Watch Mode:**
  - Integrate a filesystem watcher to monitor JSON Schema files and automatically trigger diff generation, validation, and report updates.
  - Provide continuous, real‑time notifications via CLI (`--watch`) and HTTP endpoint (`/watch`).
  - Include robust error handling and event logging for a seamless monitoring experience.

## New: Dry Run Simulation
- **Simulation Mode:**
  - Introduce a Dry Run mode activated via a CLI flag (e.g., `--dry-run`) or an HTTP endpoint (e.g., `/dry-run`).
  - Simulate the effects of schema changes, including diff generation and validation, without writing any changes to persistent storage.
  - Allow developers to preview potential impacts in a safe environment before applying actual updates.

- **User Interaction and Feedback:**
  - Provide clear, non-persistent output that indicates what changes would occur if the operation were executed.
  - Integrate simulation results with existing documentation generation and recommendation analytics to help users make informed decisions.

## Implementation & Testing
- **Single-File Consolidation:**
  - Enhance the existing source file (e.g., `src/lib/schema_manager.js`) to incorporate the Dry Run Simulation alongside current functionalities.

- **CLI and HTTP Integration:**
  - Extend CLI entry points to support the new `--dry-run` flag.
  - Expose the dry run functionality on a dedicated HTTP endpoint (`/dry-run`) with consistent error handling and logging.

- **Comprehensive Testing:**
  - Expand unit and integration tests to cover the Dry Run mode along with the live monitoring, diff analytics, and core operations.

## Value Proposition
Integrating Dry Run Simulation into SCHEMA_MANAGER empowers developers to safely evaluate schema changes without risking production data. By adding a simulation layer, this enhancement reduces risks associated with schema evolution, promotes thorough testing, and aligns with the mission of simplifying API change management.
