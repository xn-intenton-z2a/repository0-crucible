# SCHEMA_MANAGER

## Overview
The SCHEMA_MANAGER module is the heart of our repository. It manages and evolves JSON Schemas, providing detailed diff generation, validation, linting, risk analysis, and extended capabilities including ontology conversion and legacy schema support. This enhancement empowers developers with tools to not only track schema modifications but also to transition smoothly from older schema versions to the current standards.

## Diff Generation & Reporting
- **Change Analysis:** Detect and categorize differences between schema versions (additions, modifications, removals).
- **Multi-format Export:** Produce detailed diff reports in Markdown, HTML, PDF, and YAML formats.
- **Visualization Enhancements:** Enable interactive diff views with zoom, pan, and annotated changes.

## Persistence, Rollback & Auditing
- **Version History:** Maintain complete version control for schema modifications.
- **Safe Rollback:** Support rollback of changes using merge flags (e.g., `--merge-persist`).

## Linting, Validation & Auto-Fix
- **Advanced Linting:** Identify schema inconsistencies and deprecated patterns, offering inline recommendations.
- **Automated Fixes:** Utilize CLI flag (`--auto-fix`) for resolving common issues automatically.
- **Strict Validation:** Integrate with Zod for precise schema validation along with plain-language explanations.

## Batch Processing & Interactive Simulation
- **Concurrent Operations:** Process multiple schema files simultaneously for bulk validation, diffing, and auto-fixing.
- **Interactive REPL:** Launch a sandbox for simulating schema changes with live diff previews and immediate feedback.

## Risk Analysis & Scoring
- **Risk Assessment Engine:** Evaluate the potential impacts of schema changes based on change type and historical data.
- **Actionable Insights:** Generate risk reports with clear recommendations, highlighting areas needing attention.
- **CLI Integration:** Introduce a CLI flag (`--risk-assess`) for on-demand risk evaluations.

## Ontology Conversion
- **New Capability:** Convert JSON Schema definitions to OWL ontologies, bridging the gap between API definitions and semantic web technologies.
- **CLI Flag:** Introduce a new CLI flag (`--convert-ontology`) to trigger the conversion process.
- **Implementation:** Extend the primary source file (`src/lib/schema_manager.js`) to incorporate ontology conversion with minimal additional dependencies.

## Legacy Schema Support
- **Overview:** Provide backward compatibility for legacy JSON Schema formats, enabling a smooth transition to current standards.
- **Conversion & Compatibility Checks:** Automatically detect schemas in legacy formats and provide conversion suggestions or automated migrations using a CLI flag (`--legacy-support`).
- **Guided Migration:** Offer detailed diagnostic feedback and inline recommendations to guide developers through the migration process.
- **Integration:** Incorporate legacy support within the existing diffing and validation workflows to ensure a seamless experience.

## Implementation & Testing
- **Single-File Extension:** Enhance the main source file (`src/lib/schema_manager.js`) to integrate legacy schema support alongside existing functionalities.
- **CLI & HTTP Endpoints:** Update command parsers to include new flags (`--legacy-support`) and ensure compatibility with other schema management commands.
- **Robust Testing:** Expand unit and integration tests to cover all new functionalities, including legacy schema detection, migration suggestions, and conversion edge cases.

## Value Proposition
The enhanced SCHEMA_MANAGER not only streamlines JSON Schema evolution with robust diffing, validation, and ontology conversion but also adds critical support for legacy schema formats. This ensures that teams can confidently transition from older formats while maintaining operational transparency and minimizing migration risk.
