# SCHEMA_MANAGER

## Overview
The SCHEMA_MANAGER is the core module responsible for managing JSON Schema evolution. It provides robust features for diff generation, schema validation, linting with auto-fix capabilities, and integration with AI-driven risk assessments. This update refines the current functionalities while introducing new capabilities focused on batch processing and enhanced interactive feedback.

## Core Functionalities

### Diff Generation & Reporting
- **Change Analysis:** Detect and categorize differences between schema versions (additions, modifications, removals).
- **Multi-format Export:** Support for exporting detailed reports in Markdown, HTML, PDF, and YAML formats.
- **Visualization Enhancements:** Provide interactive diff visualizations with zoom, pan, and annotated change logs.

### Persistence, Rollback & Auditing
- **Version History:** Maintain a complete, versioned history of schema modifications.
- **Safe Rollback:** Use flags (e.g., `--merge-persist`) to consolidate and safely rollback changes.

### Linting, Static Analysis & Auto-Fix
- **Advanced Linting:** Automatically check for schema inconsistencies, deprecated patterns, and common pitfalls with inline warnings and suggestions.
- **Automated Fixes:** Introduce an optional CLI flag (`--auto-fix`) to automatically correct detected issues.
- **Summary Reporting:** Generate comprehensive reports summarizing linting outcomes and auto-fix operations.

### Validation, Explanations & Auto-Generation
- **Strict Validation:** Integrate Zod for schema validation with plain-language explanations generated via AI.
- **Baseline Generation:** Automatically generate baseline JSON Schema definitions from sample objects with live previews and CLI/HTTP export capabilities.

### Enhanced AI-Driven Risk Assessment & Patch Suggestions
- **Risk Scoring:** Leverage AI to evaluate schema risk factors and assign scores.
- **Actionable Patches:** Offer sample code patches and remedial suggestions during interactive simulation sessions and within CI/CD pipelines via the `--risk-assess` flag.

### Batch Processing & Multi-Schema Support
- **Batch Operations:** Introduce the ability to process multiple schema files asynchronously, enabling bulk validation, diffing, and auto-fix actions.
- **Performance Optimization:** Employ caching and incremental processing to efficiently handle large sets of schemas.
- **Status Monitoring:** Provide real-time progress updates and error tracking for batch operations.

### Interactive Simulation & REPL Mode
- **Sandbox Environment:** Launch an interactive REPL for safe, real‑time simulation of schema changes with immediate diff generation.
- **Live Updates:** Enable real‑time validations and on-the-fly risk assessments triggered by file changes.

### Remote Registry Integration
- **Schema Synchronization:** Support syncing with a remote schema registry to fetch latest versions, and compare with local drafts.
- **Conflict Resolution:** Provide tools to resolve version conflicts using integrated diff and patch generation mechanisms.

## Implementation & Testing
- **Single-File Extension:** Extend the main schema management source (e.g., `src/lib/schema_manager.js`) to integrate new batch processing and enhanced interactive features while preserving the existing functionalities.
- **CLI & HTTP Integration:** Update CLI parsers to include new flags (e.g., `--batch`, `--auto-fix`, `--risk-assess`, and `--sync`), and expose corresponding endpoints via HTTP.
- **Robust Testing:** Augment unit and integration tests covering normal, edge-case, and batch processing scenarios to ensure reliability and performance.
- **Documentation Updates:** Revise README and inline documentation to include examples and usage guidelines for the new batch processing and enhanced validation features.

## Value Proposition
By refining the SCHEMA_MANAGER, this update not only maintains its comprehensive diffing, simulation, and risk assessment capabilities, but it also introduces batch processing and performance improvements. These enhancements streamline the workflow for managing multiple schemas, reduce manual overhead by automating fixes, and reinforce our mission to simplify API change management with high-quality, robust schema definitions.
