# SCHEMA_MANAGER

## Overview
The SCHEMA_MANAGER module is the central component of our repository, responsible for the evolution and validation of JSON Schemas. It supports schema diff generation, version control, migration assistance, and now expanded ontology and semantic integration. This unified module ensures smooth transitions from legacy schema formats and provides powerful analytical tools for risk assessment and automated fixes.

## Diff Generation & Reporting
- **Change Analysis:** Detect and categorize differences between schema versions including additions, modifications, and removals.
- **Multi-format Export:** Produce detailed diff reports in Markdown, HTML, PDF, and YAML formats with visualization enhancements such as interactive diff views with zoom, pan, and annotated changes.
- **CLI Compare Command:** Introduce a CLI command (`--compare <file1> <file2>`) to compare arbitrary JSON Schema files, leveraging robust diff algorithms and generating comprehensive multi-format reports.

## Persistence, Rollback & Auditing
- **Version History:** Maintain complete version control for all schema modifications.
- **Safe Rollback:** Enable rollback of changes using merge flags (e.g., `--merge-persist`) to ensure data integrity and minimize migration risks.

## Linting, Validation & Auto-Fix
- **Advanced Linting:** Identify schema inconsistencies and deprecated patterns with inline recommendations for corrections.
- **Automated Fixes:** Allow users to automatically resolve common issues via a CLI flag (`--auto-fix`).
- **Strict Validation:** Integrate with Zod for precise JSON Schema validation and provide detailed plain-language explanations.

## Batch Processing & Interactive Simulation
- **Concurrent Operations:** Support parallel processing of multiple schema files for bulk validation, diff generation, and auto-fixing tasks.
- **Interactive REPL:** Offer a sandbox environment for testing schema modifications in real time with live diff previews and immediate feedback.

## Risk Analysis & Scoring
- **Risk Assessment Engine:** Evaluate potential schema change risks using analysis of change types and historical modifications.
- **Actionable Insights:** Provide clear risk reports with recommendations that highlight critical areas needing developer attention.
- **CLI Integration:** Support risk evaluations via a dedicated CLI flag (`--risk-assess`).

## Ontology & Semantic Integration
- **Live Data Integration:** Leverage curated public data sources to enrich the JSON Schema data, forming the basis for dynamic ontology generation.
- **OWL Ontology Generation:** Transform JSON Schema definitions into OWL ontologies, enhancing semantic capabilities and facilitating interoperability with semantic web technologies.
- **Dedicated CLI Command:** Support ontology building through a CLI flag (`--build-ontology`), allowing for on-demand or scheduled generation and updates.
- **Legacy Schema Support:** Detect and manage legacy schema formats with options for automated migration and conversion enhancements.

## Implementation & Testing
- **Single-File Extension:** Integrate new ontology and semantic features within the existing main source file (e.g., `src/lib/schema_manager.js`), ensuring a cohesive and maintainable codebase.
- **CLI & HTTP Endpoints:** Update command parsers to include new ontology commands alongside existing flags, ensuring seamless integration across all schema management workflows.
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Expand unit and integration tests to cover scenarios including diffing, legacy handling, risk assessment, linting, and live ontology generation.

## Value Proposition
By merging the ontology and enhanced schema evolution capabilities into the SCHEMA_MANAGER, the repository offers a streamlined toolset that not only manages JSON Schema differences and migrations effectively but also bridges to modern semantic web technologies. This alignment reinforces our mission of simplifying API change management, enhancing operational transparency, and reducing migration risks in a single, unified repository.
