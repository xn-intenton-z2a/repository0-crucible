# SCHEMA_MANAGER Feature

## Overview
The SCHEMA_MANAGER feature consolidates the core capabilities required for managing JSON Schema evolution. It now includes diff generation, interactive editing, versioned persistence with rollback, real‑time synchronization, enhanced validation with Zod, and AI‑powered plain‑language explanations with robust caching. In this update, an additional capability has been integrated to automatically generate JSON Schemas from sample JSON objects, providing a seamless starting point for schema evolution.

This update further enhances the feature with **Diff Analytics** capabilities that aggregate historical diff data to provide actionable insights into schema changes over time. These analytics help teams assess trends, identify frequently changing sections, and support strategic decisions for API evolution.

## Core Functionalities
- **Diff Generation & Reporting:**
  - Generate clear diffs outlining additions, removals, and modifications between JSON Schema definitions.
  - Auto‑generate dynamic markdown and HTML reports with filtering and collapsible sections.

- **Persistence, Rollback & Auditing:**
  - Persist diff outputs along with a versioned audit trail.
  - Support rollback operations with confirmation prompts and integrity checks to revert to stable schema states.

- **Interactive Editing & Live Synchronization:**
  - Provide an interactive schema editor with real‑time monitoring, collaborative guidance via WebSockets, and direct integration with CLI commands.

- **Validation & Enhanced Explanations:**
  - Enforce schema standards using Zod and deliver immediate validation feedback.
  - Offer AI‑powered, plain‑language explanations of schema changes along with asynchronous error notifications and robust caching for performance.

- **Auto Schema Generation:**
  - Convert sample JSON objects into baseline JSON Schema definitions.
  - Provide an interactive preview and customization interface before finalizing auto‑generated schemas.

- **Diff Analytics:**
  - Aggregate and analyze historical diff data to generate trend reports and highlight recurrent schema changes.
  - Provide statistical summaries and visual/textual analytics through CLI commands (e.g., via a new `--analytics` flag) integrated in the same source file.
  - Enable developers to gain insights into evolving patterns in their JSON schemas, supporting more informed API evolution decisions.

## Implementation & Testing
- **Single-File Consolidation:**
  - Implement the entire SCHEMA_MANAGER logic—including diff generation, persistence, interactive editing, live synchronization, enhanced validation, auto-generation, and diff analytics—in a single source file (e.g., `src/lib/schema_manager.js`).
  
- **CLI Integration:**
  - Update the main CLI entry point to include new flags such as `--generate-schema`, `--preview-schema`, and `--analytics`, alongside existing commands like `--validate-schema` and `--explain-change`.

- **Robust Error Handling & Testing:**
  - Ensure comprehensive error management across all functionalities.
  - Develop unit and integration tests covering diff generation, persistence, rollback procedures, auto-generation routines, analytics reporting, and interactive feedback mechanisms.

## Value Proposition
By integrating auto schema generation with enhanced diffing, analytics, and validation capabilities, SCHEMA_MANAGER minimizes manual efforts in creating baseline JSON Schema definitions, accelerates API evolution, and empowers developers with accurate, standards‑compliant schemas. The added diff analytics further reduce runtime errors, facilitate smoother version transitions, and reinforce our mission of simplifying API evolution while fostering collaborative, error‑free development.
