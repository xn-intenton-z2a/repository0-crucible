# SCHEMA_MANAGER

## Overview
The SCHEMA_MANAGER module is the central component of our repository, responsible for the evolution, validation, and real‚Äêtime management of JSON Schemas. It supports schema diff generation, version control, migration assistance, linting & auto-fixing, comprehensive risk analysis, and now a new Real-Time Monitoring capability. This unified module ensures smooth transitions from legacy schema formats, offers actionable insights and automated fixes, and improves developer productivity with real-time feedback.

## Diff Generation & Reporting
- **Change Analysis:** Detect and categorize differences between schema versions including additions, modifications, and removals.
- **Multi-format Export:** Produce detailed diff reports in Markdown, HTML, PDF, and YAML formats with visualization enhancements such as interactive diff views with zoom, pan, and annotated changes.
- **CLI Compare Command:** Introduce a CLI command (`--compare <file1> <file2>`) to compare arbitrary JSON Schema files, leveraging robust diff algorithms and generating comprehensive multi-format reports.

## Persistence, Rollback & Auditing
- **Version History:** Maintain complete version control for all schema modifications.
- **Safe Rollback:** Enable rollback of changes using merge flags (e.g., `--merge-persist`) to ensure data integrity and minimize migration risks.

## Linting, Validation & Auto-Fix
- **Advanced Linting:** Identify schema inconsistencies and deprecated patterns with inline recommendations for corrections.
- **Automated Fixes:** Allow users to automatically resolve common issues via a CLI flag (`--auto-fix`).
- **Strict Validation:** Integrate with Zod for precise JSON Schema validation and provide detailed plain-language explanations.

## Batch Processing & Interactive Simulation
- **Concurrent Operations:** Support parallel processing of multiple schema files for bulk validation, diff generation, and auto-fixing tasks.
- **Interactive REPL:** Offer a sandbox environment for testing schema modifications in real time with live diff previews and immediate feedback.

## Risk Analysis & Scoring
- **Risk Assessment Engine:** Evaluate potential schema change risks using analysis of change types and historical modifications.
- **Actionable Insights:** Provide clear risk reports with recommendations that highlight critical areas needing developer attention.
- **CLI Integration:** Support risk evaluations via a dedicated CLI flag (`--risk-assess`).

## Ontology & Semantic Integration
- **Live Data Integration:** Leverage curated public data sources to enrich JSON Schema data, forming the basis for dynamic ontology generation.
- **OWL Ontology Generation:** Transform JSON Schema definitions into OWL ontologies, enhancing semantic capabilities and facilitating interoperability with semantic web technologies.
- **CLI Command:** Support ontology building through a CLI flag (`--build-ontology`), enabling both on-demand and scheduled generation.
- **Legacy Schema Support:** Detect and manage legacy schema formats with automated migration and conversion tools.

## Real-Time Monitoring & Auto-Trigger (New Addition)
- **File System Watcher:** Integrate a real-time monitoring system that watches for changes in JSON Schema files.
- **Automated Diff & Analysis:** Automatically trigger diff generation, linting, and risk analysis when file changes are detected.
- **Developer Notification:** Provide immediate terminal feedback and optional logging via CLI flags so developers can quickly respond to schema updates.
- **Configurable Behavior:** Allow users to enable or disable real-time monitoring and customize the frequency or conditions under which the auto-trigger operates.

## Implementation & Testing
- **Single File Extension:** Extend the main source file (e.g., `src/lib/schema_manager.js`) to incorporate the new real-time monitoring capabilities.
- **CLI & HTTP Endpoints:** Update command parsers to include new flags for monitoring (e.g., `--watch`) along with the existing commands.
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Expand unit and integration tests to cover scenarios including file change detection, real-time diff generation, risk analysis, and auto-fix operations.

## Value Proposition
By integrating a real-time monitoring system into the SCHEMA_MANAGER, the repository not only manages JSON Schema differences and migrations effectively but also provides instant feedback during development. This enhancement reduces manual intervention, accelerates development cycles, and reinforces our mission of simplifying API change management by delivering dynamic and automated schema oversight.
