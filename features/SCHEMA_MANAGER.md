# SCHEMA_MANAGER

This feature remains the core engine for managing JSON Schema evolution. It facilitates schema versioning, diff generation, interactive simulation (including a REPL mode), validation, export, and continuous integration support.

## Overview

The SCHEMA_MANAGER handles versioned JSON Schemas by automating diff generation, interactive simulation, and predictive analytics. It supports integration via both CLI flags and HTTP endpoints to ensure rapid iteration and safe schema evolution throughout development. In this update, we refine the existing functionalities and add AI-driven risk assessment to provide proactive, actionable insights during schema modifications.

## Core Functionalities

### Diff Generation & Reporting
- Generate detailed diffs capturing additions, modifications, and removals in JSON Schemas.
- Output reports in multiple formats: Markdown, HTML, PDF, and YAML.

### Persistence, Rollback & Auditing
- Maintain versioned schema histories with robust rollback and comprehensive audit logs.
- Utilize the `--merge-persist` flag to safely consolidate version histories.

### Interactive Simulation & REPL Mode
- Launch a REPL environment via the `--repl` flag to simulate schema changes in real time.
- Preview diff generation, validation routines, and risk assessments interactively, with sandbox mode for experiments.

### Validation, Explanations & Auto-Generation
- Integrate Zod for strict schema validation with immediate, plain-language AI-enhanced error explanations.
- Automatically generate baseline JSON Schema definitions from sample objects with interactive previews.
- Support export operations through both CLI flags and HTTP endpoints.

### Extended Recommendation Analytics
- Analyze historical diff data to identify trends and offer actionable recommendations for schema improvements.
- Trigger analytics via CLI flags or HTTP endpoints for continuous feedback.

### AI-DRIVEN RISK ASSESSMENT
- **Proactive Risk Scoring:** Leverage AI (e.g., via OpenAI integration) to score schema changes on potential risk factors.
- **Actionable Insights:** Provide instant feedback and recommendations to mitigate risk during schema modifications.
- **Seamless Integration:** Incorporate risk assessment into both the REPL mode and automated CI workflows through dedicated CLI flags.

### Interactive Diff Visualization & Live Updates
- Graphically render schema diffs with advanced visual cues (color coding, animations, zoom, and panning).
- Enable realâ€‘time updates with live watch mode, automatically triggering validations, diff generation, and report updates on file changes.

### Continuous Integration Support
- Integrate seamlessly with CI workflows (e.g., GitHub Actions) using CLI flags such as `--ci-check`.
- Generate standardized reports suitable for inclusion in CI logs to provide immediate developer feedback.

### Performance & Developer Experience Enhancements
- **Optimized Computation:** Enhance diff generation and simulation performance to reduce overhead during extensive schema evolutions.
- **Feedback Loop:** Implement detailed logging and error notifications guiding developers during interactive sessions and automated runs.
- **Unified Interface:** Ensure both CLI and HTTP endpoints offer consistent behavior with robust error handling.

## Implementation & Testing

- **Single-File Extension:** Expand the main source file (e.g., `src/lib/schema_manager.js`) to incorporate the AI-driven risk assessment and improved REPL features.
- **CLI Integration:** Update the CLI parser to recognize additional flags such as `--repl`, `--ci-check`, and a new `--risk-assess` flag without breaking existing commands.
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Augment both unit and integration tests (using vitest) to cover new risk assessment flows, performance metrics, and edge-case validations.

## Value Proposition

By refining the SCHEMA_MANAGER with improved performance, enhanced developer feedback, and AI-driven risk assessment, this feature strengthens its role as the backbone of schema evolution. It provides developers with immediate, actionable insights into schema changes, reduces risk, and streamlines API evolution in alignment with our mission to simplify API change management.
