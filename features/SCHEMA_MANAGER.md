# SCHEMA_MANAGER

## Overview
The SCHEMA_MANAGER module is the heart of our repository. It manages and evolves JSON Schemas, providing detailed diff generation, validation, linting, risk analysis, and now extended ontology conversion capabilities. This enhancement empowers developers with tools to not only track schema modifications but also to transform JSON Schema definitions into OWL ontologies, bridging the gap between API definition and semantic web standards.

## Diff Generation & Reporting
- **Change Analysis:** Detect and categorize differences between schema versions (additions, modifications, removals).
- **Multi-format Export:** Produce detailed diff reports in Markdown, HTML, PDF, and YAML formats.
- **Visualization Enhancements:** Enable interactive diff views with zoom, pan, and annotated changes.

## Persistence, Rollback & Auditing
- **Version History:** Maintain complete version control for schema modifications.
- **Safe Rollback:** Support rollback of changes using merge flags (e.g., `--merge-persist`).

## Linting, Validation & Auto-Fix
- **Advanced Linting:** Identify schema inconsistencies and deprecated patterns, offering inline recommendations.
- **Automated Fixes:** Utilize CLI flag (`--auto-fix`) for resolving common issues automatically.
- **Strict Validation:** Integrate with Zod for precise schema validation alongside plain-language explanations.

## Batch Processing & Interactive Simulation
- **Concurrent Operations:** Process multiple schema files simultaneously to enable bulk validation, diffing, and fixing.
- **Interactive REPL:** Launch a sandbox for simulating schema changes with live diff previews and immediate feedback.

## Risk Analysis & Scoring
- **Risk Assessment Engine:** Evaluate potential impacts of schema changes based on change type and historical data.
- **Actionable Insights:** Generate risk reports with clear recommendations, highlighting areas needing attention.
- **CLI Integration:** Introduce a CLI flag (`--risk-assess`) for on-demand risk evaluations.

## Ontology Conversion
- **New Capability:** Convert JSON Schema definitions to OWL ontologies, providing a bridge between API definitions and semantic web frameworks.
- **CLI Flag:** Introduce a new CLI flag (`--convert-ontology`) to trigger the conversion process.
- **Use Cases:** Facilitate integration with ontology-driven systems and enhance the semantic richness of API designs.
- **Implementation:** Extend the existing source file (`src/lib/schema_manager.js`) to parse JSON Schema content and output OWL-compliant ontologies, ensuring minimal additional dependencies.

## Implementation & Testing
- **Single-File Extension:** Enhance the primary source file to incorporate all functionalities including ontology conversion.
- **CLI & HTTP Endpoints:** Update command parsers to include new flags, ensuring seamless integration with the existing CLI interface.
- **Robust Testing:** Expand current unit and integration tests to cover all new functionalities, including edge cases in ontology conversion.

## Value Proposition
Integrating ontology conversion into SCHEMA_MANAGER not only streamlines JSON Schema management but also extends the tool's reach by connecting API definitions to semantic technologies. This empowers developers to create richer, more interconnected systems while maintaining strong version control and operational transparency.
