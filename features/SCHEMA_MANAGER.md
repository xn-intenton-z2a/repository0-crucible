# SCHEMA_MANAGER Feature

## Overview
The SCHEMA_MANAGER feature consolidates the core capabilities required for managing JSON Schema evolution. It tracks changes with diff generation, interactive editing, versioned persistent storage with rollback, and real‑time synchronization. In this update, the feature further refines JSON Schema validation with Zod, enhanced AI‑powered explanations with robust caching, and improved asynchronous error notifications. This upgrade strengthens our commitment to error‑free API evolution and developer collaboration.

## Core Functionalities
- **Diff Generation & Reporting:**
  - Generate clear diffs outlining additions, removals, and modifications in JSON Schema definitions.
  - Auto‑generate dynamic markdown and HTML reports with filtering and collapsible sections.

- **Persistence, Rollback & Auditing:**
  - Persist diff outputs along with a versioned audit trail.
  - Support rollback operations with confirmation prompts and integrity checks to revert to stable schema states.

- **Interactive Editing & Live Synchronization:**
  - Provide an interactive schema editor with real‑time monitoring, guidance, and collaboration via WebSockets.

- **Validation & Enhanced Explanations:**
  - Integrate schema validation routines using Zod to enforce standards and provide immediate validation feedback.
  - Offer AI‑powered, plain‑language explanations of schema changes with a robust caching layer for performance.
  - Include custom error reporting and asynchronous notifications for critical validation failures.

## Implementation & Testing
- **Single-File Consolidation:**
  - Implement the consolidated logic in a single source file (e.g., `src/lib/schema_manager.js`), including diff generation, persistent audit trails, interactive editing, live sync, and enhanced validation routines.

- **CLI Integration:**
  - Update the main CLI entry point to support new flags (such as `--validate-schema` and `--explain-change`) for triggering validation routines alongside diff and persistence operations.

- **Robust Error Handling:**
  - Ensure comprehensive error handling across diff generation, validation, persistence, rollback, and asynchronous notifications.
  - Develop unit and integration tests covering all functionalities including error conditions, validation feedback, and AI explanation caching.

## Value Proposition
By enhancing JSON Schema validation and integrating real‑time, AI‑powered explanations with robust error notifications, the updated SCHEMA_MANAGER ensures that only valid, standards‑compliant schemas advance through development. This unified approach minimizes runtime errors, accelerates developer productivity, and fortifies our mission of simplifying API evolution and fostering collaborative, error‑free development.
