# SCHEMA_MANAGER

This feature remains the core engine for managing JSON Schema evolution. It facilitates schema versioning, diff generation, interactive simulation (including a REPL mode), validation, export, and continuous integration support. In this update, we refine the existing functionalities with enhanced performance optimizations and developer feedback mechanisms to further simplify API change management in-line with our mission.

## Overview

The SCHEMA_MANAGER handles versioned JSON Schemas by automating diff generation, interactive simulation, and predictive analytics. It supports integration via both CLI flags and HTTP endpoints, ensuring rapid iteration and safe schema evolution throughout development.

## Core Functionalities

### Diff Generation & Reporting
- Generate detailed diffs that capture additions, modifications, and removals in JSON Schemas.
- Output reports in multiple formats: Markdown, HTML, PDF, and YAML.

### Persistence, Rollback & Auditing
- Maintain versioned schema histories with robust rollback capabilities and comprehensive audit logs.
- Use the `--merge-persist` flag to consolidate version histories while preserving data integrity.

### Interactive Simulation & REPL Mode
- Enter a dedicated REPL environment via the `--repl` flag to simulate schema changes in real time.
- Preview the results of diff generation, validation routines, and risk assessments interactively.
- Experiment with schema modifications in a sandbox mode without committing changes.

### Validation, Explanations & Auto-Generation
- Integrate Zod for strict schema validation, providing immediate, plain-language, AI-enhanced explanations for any errors.
- Automatically generate baseline JSON Schema definitions from sample objects with interactive previews.
- Support export operations through both CLI flags and HTTP endpoints.

### Extended Recommendation Analytics
- Analyze historical diff data to detect trends and offer actionable recommendations for schema improvements.
- Trigger analytics via dedicated CLI flags or HTTP endpoints, ensuring continuous feedback.

### Interactive Diff Visualization & Live Updates
- Graphically render schema diffs with advanced visual cues (color coding, animations, zoom, and panning).
- Enable realâ€‘time updates in live watch mode, where file changes automatically trigger validations, diff generation, and report updates.

### Continuous Integration Support
- Seamlessly integrate with CI workflows (e.g., GitHub Actions) using CLI flags such as `--ci-check`.
- Generate standardized reports suitable for direct inclusion in CI logs to provide immediate development feedback.

### Performance & Developer Experience Enhancements
- **Optimized Computation:** Enhance diff generation and simulation performance, reducing overhead during large schema evolutions.
- **Feedback Loop:** Implement detailed logging and error notifications to guide developers during interactive sessions and automated runs.
- **Unified Interface:** Ensure that both CLI and HTTP endpoints offer consistent behavior and robust error handling, further simplifying integration.

## Implementation & Testing
- **Single-File Extension:** Expand the main source file (e.g., `src/lib/schema_manager.js`) to incorporate new REPL and performance features.
- **CLI Integration:** Update the CLI parser to recognize additional flags such as `--repl` and `--ci-check` without breaking existing commands.
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Augment unit and integration tests (using vitest) to cover new simulation flows, performance metrics, and edge-case validations.

## Value Proposition

By refining the SCHEMA_MANAGER with improved performance, enhanced developer feedback, and a robust interactive simulation mode, this feature solidifies its role as the backbone of schema evolution. It provides developers with immediate, actionable insights into schema changes, thereby reducing risk and streamlining API evolution in accordance with our mission.
