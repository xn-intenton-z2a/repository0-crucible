# SCHEMA_MANAGER

## Overview
This feature manages JSON Schema evolution by integrating diff generation, interactive simulation, and AI-driven risk assessment. In this updated version, we further enhance the tool with automated patch suggestions for schema modifications. This provides developers not only with insights into potential risks but also with actionable remediation steps through sample code patches.

## Core Functionalities

- **Diff Generation & Reporting**
  - Analyze changes between schema versions capturing additions, modifications, and removals.
  - Support exporting reports in various formats including Markdown, HTML, PDF, and YAML.

- **Persistence, Rollback & Auditing**
  - Maintain versioned history with full rollback support and audit logs.
  - Use flags like `--merge-persist` for safe consolidation of version histories.

- **Interactive Simulation & REPL Mode**
  - Launch a REPL environment via the `--repl` flag for real-time schema change simulation.
  - Provide sandboxed simulations with immediate diff previews and preliminary risk evaluations.

- **Validation, Explanations & Auto-Generation**
  - Integrate Zod for strict validation coupled with machine-generated plain-language explanations.
  - Automatically generate baseline JSON Schema definitions from sample objects with live previews.
  - Support export operations through both CLI flags and HTTP endpoints.

- **Enhanced AI-Driven Risk Assessment & Patch Suggestions**
  - Leverage AI (e.g., OpenAI integration) to assign risk scores based on defined schema risk factors.
  - Supply actionable insights and recommendations, including auto-generated patch suggestions that provide sample code modifications to remediate detected issues.
  - Integrate patch suggestions into both interactive sessions and CI/CD pipelines using the new `--risk-assess` flag.

- **Interactive Diff Visualization & Live Updates**
  - Graphically enhance diff outputs with visual cues, animations, zoom, and panning features.
  - Enable realâ€‘time updates that trigger validations, diff re-generation, risk assessments, and patch suggestion refreshes upon schema file changes.

## Implementation & Testing

- **Single-File Extension**: Update the main schema management source (e.g. `src/lib/schema_manager.js`) to integrate additional AI-driven patch suggestion functionality without disrupting existing features.
- **CLI & HTTP Integration**: Extend the CLI parser to support the additional flag (`--risk-assess`) and ensure seamless behavior across HTTP endpoints.
- **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Augment the unit and integration test suites to cover new flows for risk assessment and patch suggestion generation, ensuring reliable evaluations and remediation advice.

## Value Proposition

The updated SCHEMA_MANAGER empowers developers by not only identifying potential schema risks but also by assisting in the remediation process with intelligent patch suggestions. This evolution of the feature streamlines schema evolution workflows, reduces the risk of breaking changes, and fosters a smoother API evolution process, fully aligning with our mission of simplifying API change management.
