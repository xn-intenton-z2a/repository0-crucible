# SCHEMA_MANAGER Enhanced Simulation and Persistence

This update refines the existing SCHEMA_MANAGER feature to further empower developers with a robust and safe schema evolution process. In addition to its current capabilities for diff generation, persistence, interactive editing, validation, and export, this enhancement incorporates extended functionalities for simulation logging and new CLI operations for persistence merging and refresh.

## Overview

The SCHEMA_MANAGER now not only manages versioned JSON Schemas and their diffs but also provides a secure, non‑persistent simulation mode. Developers can now preview schema changes, assess their impact, and safely merge schema version histories using dedicated CLI operations. This feature retains full compatibility with existing CLI flags and HTTP endpoints, ensuring an integrated experience across all operations.

## Core Functionalities

### Diff Generation & Reporting

- Generate detailed diffs capturing additions, modifications, and removals in JSON Schemas.
- Support dynamic report generation in multiple formats such as Markdown, HTML, PDF, and YAML.

### Persistence, Rollback & Auditing

- Maintain versioned schema histories with robust rollback mechanisms and comprehensive audit trails.
- **New:** Merge persistence feature to consolidate schema histories using the `--merge-persist` CLI flag.

### Interactive Editing & Synchronization

- Enable real‑time collaborative editing with live synchronization across tools.

### Validation & AI‑Powered Explanations

- Integrate Zod for rigorous schema validation.
- Provide plain‑language AI‑enhanced explanations of changes and validation errors.

### Auto Schema Generation & Export

- Generate baseline JSON Schema definitions from sample JSON objects with interactive previews.
- Support schema export via CLI flags and HTTP endpoints.

### Documentation Generation

- Automatically produce human‑readable documentation based on schema diffs and export data.
- Allow customization of output via document templates.

### Extended Recommendation Analytics

- Analyze historical diff data to detect trends and provide actionable improvement recommendations.
- Trigger recommendation analysis using dedicated CLI flags and HTTP endpoints.

### Interactive Diff Visualization

- Graphically render schema diffs with color coding, animations, zoom, and panning.
- Offer detailed tooltips for specific changes.

### Live Watch Mode

- Continuously monitor JSON Schema files with a filesystem watcher to trigger automatic diff generation, validation, and report updates.
- Provide real‑time notifications with robust error handling and event logging.

### Enhanced Dry Run Simulation

- Simulate the effects of schema changes, including diff generation, validation, and export operations, without modifying persistent storage.
- Generate detailed simulation logs that outline potential changes and risks.
- Integrate simulation results with recommendation analytics and dynamic documentation generation.

## Additional CLI Operations

### Persistence Merging & Refresh

- **Merge Persistence:** Introduce the `--merge-persist` CLI flag to merge and reconcile versioned schema histories. This operation consolidates persistence stores while ensuring data integrity and conflict resolution.
- **Refresh Operation:** Utilize the `--refresh` CLI flag to update and revalidate current schema states, ensuring that all schema changes are accurately reflected and compliant.
- Both operations follow the same robust error handling and logging protocols as other CLI and HTTP endpoints.

## Implementation & Testing

- **Single-File Consolidation:** Enhance the existing source file (e.g., `src/lib/schema_manager.js`) to incorporate the refined Dry Run Simulation, new persistence merging, and refresh functionalities.
- **CLI and HTTP Integration:** Extend CLI command parsing to support the new `--merge-persist` and `--refresh` flags. Expose corresponding HTTP endpoints if needed while maintaining consistent error handling and detailed output.
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Update unit and integration tests to cover simulation logs, persistence merging operations, and refresh functionalities alongside core operations.

## Value Proposition

The enhanced SCHEMA_MANAGER now empowers developers to safely evaluate and understand schema changes before they are applied. With the addition of detailed simulation logs and new CLI operations for persistence merging and refresh, this feature mitigates risk, facilitates informed decision-making, and reinforces our mission to simplify API change management.
