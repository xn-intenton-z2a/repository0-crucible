# SCHEMA_MANAGER

## Overview
The SCHEMA_MANAGER remains the central module for managing the evolution of JSON Schemas. In this update, we introduce an enhanced linting module that now includes an automated fix capability for schema inconsistencies. This enhancement streamlines the development workflow by not only detecting schema issues but also suggesting and, optionally, applying corrections automatically.

## Core Functionalities

### Diff Generation & Reporting
- Analyze changes between schema versions, capturing additions, modifications, and removals.
- Support export of detailed reports in multiple formats (Markdown, HTML, PDF, YAML).

### Persistence, Rollback & Auditing
- Maintain a versioned history of schema modifications with full rollback capabilities.
- Use flags like `--merge-persist` for safe consolidation of version histories.

### Interactive Simulation & REPL Mode
- Launch a sandboxed REPL for real‑time simulation of schema changes with immediate diff previews.
- Incorporate preliminary risk evaluations during simulation sessions.

### Validation, Explanations & Auto-Generation
- Integrate Zod for strict schema validation, accompanied by plain-language explanations generated via AI.
- Automatically generate baseline JSON Schema definitions from sample objects with live previews and export capabilities via CLI and HTTP endpoints.

### Enhanced AI-Driven Risk Assessment & Patch Suggestions
- Leverage AI to assign risk scores based on schema risk factors and suggest actionable remediation steps, including sample code patches.
- Integrate patch suggestions into interactive sessions and CI/CD pipelines using the `--risk-assess` flag.

### Interactive Diff Visualization & Live Updates
- Enhance diff outputs with visual cues, animations, and interactive elements such as zoom and panning.
- Enable real‑time validations, diff re-generation, risk assessments, and patch refreshes triggered by schema file changes.

### Linting, Static Analysis & Auto-Fix
- **Linting Enhancements:** Automatically check schema files for common pitfalls, inconsistencies, and deprecated patterns.
- **Inline Warnings & Suggestions:** Provide inline warnings and detailed suggestions to maintain high-quality, consistent schema definitions.
- **Automated Fixes:** Introduce an optional CLI flag (`--auto-fix`) that attempts to automatically correct detected linting issues.
- **Reporting:** Generate summary reports of linting and auto-fix operations, exportable in multiple formats for developer review.

### Remote Registry Integration
- **Remote Schema Sync:** Integrate capabilities to connect with a remote schema registry. This allows fetching the latest schema versions from a central repository and comparing them with local changes.
- **Automated Updates:** Enable automatic synchronization to pull changes from the remote registry and push local validated changes when safe.
- **Conflict Resolution:** Provide tools and guidelines to resolve differences between remote and local schema versions, leveraging existing diff and patch generation functionalities.

## Implementation & Testing
- **Single-File Extension:** Update the main schema management source (e.g., `src/lib/schema_manager.js`) to integrate the enhanced linting, auto-fix module, and remote registry capabilities without affecting existing functionalities.
- **CLI & HTTP Integration:** Extend CLI parsers to incorporate new flags (`--lint`, `--auto-fix`, and `--sync`) and expose summaries via HTTP endpoints.
- **Automated Testing:** Augment unit and integration tests to cover various scenarios for linting, auto-fix, risk assessment, and remote synchronization to ensure robust coverage across schema inputs and edge cases.
- **Documentation:** Update README and documentation to illustrate usage examples, inline code snippets, and CLI invocations for the enhanced functionalities.

## Value Proposition
The updated SCHEMA_MANAGER not only maintains its comprehensive diffing, simulation, and risk assessment capabilities but now also enforces schema quality through advanced linting, automated fixes, and remote registry integration. This functionality reduces manual correction overhead, enhances schema integrity, and furthers our mission to simplify API change management by ensuring robust, high-quality schema definitions.
