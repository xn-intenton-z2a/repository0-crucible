# SCHEMA_MANAGER

## Overview
The SCHEMA_MANAGER module is the heart of our repository. It manages and evolves JSON Schemas by handling schema diff generation, validation, linting, and risk analysis. With extended capabilities such as ontology conversion and legacy schema support, it serves both as a version control system and a migration assistant, ensuring smooth transitions from older formats to the current standards.

## Diff Generation & Reporting
- **Change Analysis:** Detect and categorize differences between schema versions including additions, modifications, and removals.
- **Multi-format Export:** Produce detailed diff reports in Markdown, HTML, PDF, and YAML formats with visualization enhancements such as interactive diff views with zoom, pan, and annotated changes.
- **CLI Compare Command:** Introduce a new CLI command (`--compare <file1> <file2>`) to allow users to compare two independent JSON Schema files. This command will leverage the built-in diff algorithms and generate a comprehensive report in the supported formats, thus extending the module’s utility beyond in-repository schema evolution.

## Persistence, Rollback & Auditing
- **Version History:** Maintain comprehensive version control for all schema modifications.
- **Safe Rollback:** Enable rollback of changes using merge flags (e.g., `--merge-persist`) to ensure data integrity and minimize migration risks.

## Linting, Validation & Auto-Fix
- **Advanced Linting:** Identify schema inconsistencies and deprecated patterns, offering inline recommendations for corrections.
- **Automated Fixes:** Allow users to resolve common issues automatically using a CLI flag (`--auto-fix`).
- **Strict Validation:** Integrate with Zod for precise schema validations including detailed, plain-language explanations of any discrepancies.

## Batch Processing & Interactive Simulation
- **Concurrent Operations:** Support processing of multiple schema files simultaneously for bulk validation, diffing, and auto-fixing.
- **Interactive REPL:** Provide a sandbox environment for testing schema modifications in real time with live diff previews and immediate user feedback.

## Risk Analysis & Scoring
- **Risk Assessment Engine:** Evaluate potential risks of schema changes by analyzing change type and historical modification data.
- **Actionable Insights:** Generate risk reports with clear recommendations highlighting critical areas for developer attention.
- **CLI Integration:** Enable on-demand risk evaluations via the CLI flag (`--risk-assess`).

## Ontology Conversion & Legacy Schema Support
- **Ontology Conversion:** Convert JSON Schema definitions to OWL ontologies via a new CLI flag (`--convert-ontology`), bridging API definitions with semantic web technologies.
- **Legacy Schema Support:** Automatically detect and handle legacy schema formats, offering conversion suggestions or automated migrations using the flag (`--legacy-support`). Integrated within the overall diffing and validation workflows, this ensures a seamless upgrade path for older schemas.

## Implementation & Testing
- **Single-File Extension:** Enhance the main source file (`src/lib/schema_manager.js`) to incorporate all functionalities including legacy support and the new CLI compare command.
- **CLI & HTTP Endpoints:** Update command parsers to include the new compare command alongside existing flags and ensure seamless interactions with other schema management workflows.
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Expand unit and integration tests to cover various functionalities—schema comparison, legacy detection, risk assessment, and automated fixes—with coverage for normal and edge-case scenarios.

## Value Proposition
The enhanced SCHEMA_MANAGER not only streamlines JSON Schema evolution with robust diffing, migration, and ontology conversion capabilities but also empowers users with a direct CLI tool to compare arbitrary schema files. This reinforces our mission of simplifying API change management, ensuring operational transparency, and minimizing migration risks.
