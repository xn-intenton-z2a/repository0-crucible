# SCHEMA_MANAGER Feature

## Overview
The SCHEMA_MANAGER feature consolidates the core capabilities required for managing JSON Schema evolution. It merges diff generation, interactive editing, persistent storage with rollback, live synchronization, and now introduces robust JSON Schema validation. This enhancement ensures schemas are not only version-controlled and editable but are also automatically validated against defined constraints, aligning perfectly with our mission to simplify API evolution and promote collaborative, error‑free development.

## Core Functionalities
- **Diff Generation & Reporting:**
  - Generate clear diffs outlining additions, removals, and modifications in schema definitions.
  - Auto-generate dynamic markdown and HTML reports with filtering and collapsible sections.

- **Persistence & Rollback:**
  - Persist JSON Schema diff outputs along with a versioned audit trail.
  - Enable rollback operations with confirmation prompts and integrity checks for reverting to stable states.

- **Interactive Editing & Live Synchronization:**
  - Provide an interactive schema editor with real‑time monitoring, guidance, and collaboration via WebSockets.

- **AI-Powered Explanations & Caching:**
  - Utilize the OpenAI API to deliver plain‑language explanations of schema changes with caching for performance optimization.

- **JSON Schema Validation & Enforcement:**
  - Integrate validation routines using Zod to ensure schema changes adhere to predefined standards.
  - Validate edited schemas in real-time, providing immediate feedback to the user and preventing invalid schema updates from persisting.
  - Support custom error messages and remediation suggestions as part of the validation process.

## Implementation & Testing
- **Module Consolidation:**
  - Implement the consolidated logic in a single source file (e.g., `src/lib/schema_manager.js`), incorporating diff generation, persistent audit trails, interactive editing, live sync, and schema validation.

- **CLI Integration:**
  - Update the main CLI entry point to support new flags (such as `--validate-schema` or integrated within existing flags) to trigger validation routines alongside diff and persistence operations.

- **Robust Error Handling:**
  - Ensure comprehensive error handling across diff generation, validation, persistence, and rollback processes.
  - Write unit and integration tests to cover all functionalities including validation feedback and error conditions.

## Value Proposition
By integrating JSON Schema validation into the existing management pipeline, the SCHEMA_MANAGER not only tracks and evolves schemas efficiently but also guarantees that only valid, standards‑compliant schemas are persisted. This unified approach reduces the risk of runtime errors, enhances developer productivity, and supports a smoother API evolution process.
