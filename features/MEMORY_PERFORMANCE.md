# MEMORY_PERFORMANCE

## Overview
This feature merges the existing MEMORY logging capability with performance tracking. In addition to storing a log of CLI invocations with timestamps and arguments, the updated functionality now records the execution duration of each command. This enriched logging enables users and developers to gain insights into the performance of each command invocation, paving the way for self-improvement and optimization.

## Implementation Details
1. **Global Memory and Timing Recording:**
   - In `src/lib/main.js`, extend the global memory log to include a new property `duration` for each CLI invocation.
   - At the start of the `main` function, record the current time (e.g. using `const startTime = Date.now()`).
   - Just before the function exits (after processing any flag), calculate the elapsed time and append it as `duration` (in milliseconds) to the log entry.
   - Ensure that all log entries now have the following structure: `{ timestamp, args, duration }`.

2. **Source File Modifications:**
   - Update the logic in `src/lib/main.js` so that whenever a CLI invocation is logged into `memoryLog`, it also captures the execution duration.
   - Ensure that this measurement does not impact the CLI output or behavior.

3. **Testing Updates:**
   - In `tests/unit/main.test.js`, add assertions to verify that when the `--memory` flag is used, the returned log entries include a valid `duration` field (a non-negative number).
   - Update existing tests which check the memory log to account for this additional field.

4. **Documentation:**
   - Revise the README to include details about the merged memory and performance logging feature. Add a bullet point under CLI Options explaining that the `--memory` flag now displays each command's execution duration along with its timestamp and arguments.

## Long-Term Direction
By merging memory logging with performance tracking, the agent lays the groundwork for future self-improvement initiatives. This enriched logging will help diagnose performance bottlenecks and guide future optimizations. In later iterations, more advanced metrics (such as CPU and memory profiling per command) could be integrated to enhance monitoring and drive further automation improvements.
