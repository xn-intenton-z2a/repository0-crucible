# MEMORY_PERFORMANCE

## Overview
This update enhances the existing memory logging feature by incorporating execution duration for each CLI command. In addition to logging the timestamp and arguments, the tool will now measure and store the duration of each invocation. This provides developers and users with insight into the performance of commands, aligning with our mission of continuous self-improvement and autonomous debugging.

## Implementation Details
1. **Timing Measurement:**
   - At the very beginning of the `main` function in `src/lib/main.js`, record the start time (e.g., `const startTime = Date.now();`).
   - Before exiting the function (after processing commands or flags), compute the elapsed time (`Date.now() - startTime`) and include it as a `duration` property in the log object.
   - Update the global `memoryLog` to store entries as: `{ timestamp, args, duration }`.

2. **Source File Modifications (`src/lib/main.js`):
   - Insert the timing start code at the top of the `main` function.
   - After processing flags (or before each early return), calculate the duration and enhance the corresponding memory log entry with a new property `duration` (in milliseconds).

3. **Testing Updates (`tests/unit/main.test.js`):
   - Extend the existing memory logging tests to assert that each log entry now includes a `duration` field.
   - Verify that this field is a non-negative number.
   - Ensure that other aspects of the log (like `timestamp` and `args`) remain unchanged.

4. **Documentation Updates (README.md):
   - Update the Memory Logging section to describe the enriched log format, including the execution duration of each CLI invocation.
   - Provide an example output showing a log entry with the `duration` field.

5. **Dependencies and Compatibility:**
   - No new dependencies are required for this enhancement. All changes adhere to the project requirements and are fully testable within a single repository modification.

## Long-Term Direction
By merging performance tracking with memory logging, the tool lays the foundation for self-improvement initiatives. In future iterations, these performance metrics can guide optimizations, help pinpoint bottlenecks, and provide a richer context for automated error handling and self-refinement processes.

This update is a straightforward enhancement to existing functionality, providing tangible value without overcomplicating the repository.
