# MEMORY_PERFORMANCE

## Overview
This update enhances the memory logging mechanism by adding execution duration tracking for each CLI command. Every invocation will now record a start time and, upon completion of processing, compute the execution time. This extra data point provides insights into the performance of commands and supports future self-improvement and optimization efforts.

## Implementation Details
1. **Timing Measurement:**
   - At the very beginning of the `main` function in `src/lib/main.js`, record the start time (e.g. `const startTime = Date.now();`).
   - Before each early return or after processing the main command logic, compute the elapsed time (`Date.now() - startTime`).
   - Update the corresponding log entry in the global `memoryLog` to include a new property `duration` (in milliseconds) along with the existing `timestamp` and `args`.

2. **Source File Modifications (`src/lib/main.js`):**
   - Insert timing code at the top of `main`:
     ```js
     const startTime = Date.now();
     ```
   - Just before each return point, add the duration to the last log entry with:
     ```js
     memoryLog[memoryLog.length - 1].duration = Date.now() - startTime;
     ```
   - Ensure every CLI command execution (help, version, diagnostics, etc.) is wrapped by these timing calculations.

3. **Testing Updates (`tests/unit/main.test.js`):**
   - Enhance the memory logging tests to verify that each log entry contains a non-negative `duration` field.
   - Update test cases to check for both the presence and correctness (i.e., non-negative value) of the `duration` property.

4. **Documentation Updates (README.md):**
   - Update the Memory Logging section to describe the enriched format including the execution duration.
   - Include an example log entry in the README that shows `timestamp`, `args`, and `duration`.

## Long-Term Direction
This enhancement not only aids in monitoring performance but also lays the groundwork for automated tuning and optimization. Over time, collected duration metrics could be used to identify bottlenecks, inform dynamic re-planning, and support self-improvement initiatives, in line with the mission of intelligent, autonomous automation.
