# ARG_PARSER Feature Specification

This feature enhances the CLI behavior by implementing a simple argument parser in the main source file. The parser will inspect the command line arguments and execute the corresponding action, promoting a cleaner and more informative user experience.

## Overview

The argument parser will analyze the process argument list and respond to flags including, but not limited to, "--help", "--diagnostics", "--serve", "--build-intermediate", "--build-enhanced", "--refresh", and "--merge-persist". It will provide appropriate messages or execute a stub of functionality for each recognized flag.

## Implementation Details

- Update the source file (src/lib/main.js) to include a dedicated argument parsing section.
- Use a switch-case structure, or if/else logic, to differentiate between the various commands.
- For unrecognized arguments, the CLI will default to a standard usage message, guiding the user to the help documentation.
- Enhance the README (README.md) to include examples on how to use the new argument flags.
- Update the unit tests (tests/unit/main.test.js) to confirm that the parser handles known commands without errors.
- The changes will be confined to the CLI tool functionality and will not affect external interfaces or create new files.

## Benefits

- **Improved Usability:** Users receive clear feedback when using CLI commands.
- **Scalability:** Provides a foundation for future extension of CLI commands without major restructuring.
- **Alignment with Mission:** Enhances our intelligent and practical automation agent by making command handling more robust and user-friendly.

## Testing

- Ensure that the main module outputs appropriate responses for each recognized command.
- Validate the default behavior when no flag or an unknown flag is provided.
- Confirm that updates remain compliant with coding style guidelines and unit tests pass successfully.

## Documentation

- Update the README with clear usage examples and command descriptions.
- The code comments in the main source file will reflect the purpose and functionality of each command processed by the parser.
