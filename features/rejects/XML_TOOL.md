# XML_TOOL: Extended OWL XML Export/Import Utility

## Overview
This feature enhances the existing XML_TOOL by extending support for advanced and custom ontology models. It preserves the command-line and API capabilities for exporting and importing ontologies in the standardized OWL XML format while adding improved error handling, diagnostic logging, and detailed export of extended ontology components such as classes, properties, and metadata. The enhanced tool is fully integrated with the unified CLI and HTTP/GraphQL interface and remains backward compatible with legacy functionality.

## Functionality
- **Export Command:**
  - Retains the CLI flag `--export-xml` to export the current ontology to an XML file.
  - Uses the existing `exportOntologyToXML` function, now augmented to handle extended ontology models (advanced, custom, and hybrid) by including detailed tags for classes, properties, metadata, and annotations.
  - Enhances diagnostic logging to confirm successful export or report detailed errors.

- **Import Command:**
  - Retains the CLI flag `--import-xml` for importing an ontology from an XML file.
  - Uses the existing `importOntologyFromXML` functionality, with improved parsing to correctly restore custom and extended ontology elements.
  - Provides clear logging messages and error notifications if the input XML does not conform to expected structure.

- **Enhanced Diagnostics & Validation:**
  - Integrates detailed logging for every step of the export/import process, including validation of XML structure and content integrity.
  - Adds validation checks for extended ontology metadata to ensure that the export/import cycle reliably maintains all critical ontology data.

## Implementation Details
- **CLI Integration:**
  - Update CLI argument parsing in the main module to include examples in the documentation for using `--export-xml` and `--import-xml` flags.
  - Ensure error messages and usage instructions are clearly printed when encountering invalid XML data.

- **Library Enhancements:**
  - Extend the `exportOntologyToXML` function to include new XML tags for extended ontology fields (e.g., `<classes>`, `<properties>`, `<metadata>`, `<annotations>`), ensuring a full round-trip conversion.
  - Improve the `importOntologyFromXML` function to robustly parse these extended fields and handle unexpected XML structures gracefully.

- **Documentation & Backwards Compatibility:**
  - Update the README and CONTRIBUTING documents to reflect the new extended XML export/import capabilities, including usage examples and troubleshooting tips.
  - Maintain backward compatibility for users relying on the original XML export/import behavior, with transition notes provided in the documentation.

## Benefits
- **Interoperability:** Provides a more comprehensive and robust method for exchanging ontology data with external systems that require detailed ontology representations.
- **User Experience:** Enhances user feedback through improved CLI diagnostics and detailed logs during export/import operations.
- **Reliability:** Increased validation and error handling ensure that complex ontology models are correctly preserved and restored, minimizing data loss or format errors.
