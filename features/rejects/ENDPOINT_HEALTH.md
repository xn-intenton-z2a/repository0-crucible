# Endpoint Health

This feature provides real-time monitoring of all configured API endpoints used by the ontology builder. By periodically checking the health of endpoints, it ensures that any connectivity issues or failures are detected early and reported through both diagnostic logs and CLI outputs.

## Overview

The Endpoint Health feature will:

- Continuously ping both default and custom endpoints (as configured via the `CUSTOM_API_ENDPOINTS` environment variable).
- Log the status of each endpoint with detailed error messages when an endpoint is unresponsive or returns an error.
- Expose a new CLI command (`--health`) that displays a summary of the health status of each endpoint. This summary will include metrics such as response time, status code, and error details if applicable.
- Integrate with the existing diagnostic logging system to ensure consistency with log levels (configured via `DIAGNOSTIC_LOG_LEVEL`).

## Implementation Details

- **Endpoint Checker Module:** A new module will be created (e.g., `src/lib/endpointHealth.js`) that handles the periodic checking of endpoints using the existing HTTP/HTTPS request methods. It will support configuration of check intervals via an environment variable (e.g., `HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL`).
- **CLI Integration:** Add a new CLI command `--health` that will trigger the endpoint health check and print a well-formatted status summary.
- **Logging and Alerts:** Utilize the `logDiagnostic` function to log warnings/errors for endpoints that fail health checks. Optionally, integrate an alert mechanism (e.g., a simple console alert or file-based alert) for critical issues.
- **Configuration Options:** Allow configuration of health check interval and timeout via environment variables. Also, the feature should gracefully disable itself if a certain environment variable (e.g., `DISABLE_HEALTH_CHECK`) is set.

## Testing

- **Unit Tests:** Create tests to simulate various endpoint responses (successful, timeout, error) and ensure that the health checker logs appropriate messages and returns correct status summaries.
- **Integration Tests:** Ensure that the new CLI command `--health` outputs valid JSON or formatted text summarizing the endpoint statuses. Use mock endpoints to simulate live conditions.
- **Edge Cases:** Verify behavior when no custom endpoints are provided and when endpoints are temporarily down.

This feature aligns with the mission of providing live, verified data sources by ensuring proactive monitoring and reliability of endpoint connections.
