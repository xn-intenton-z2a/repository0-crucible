# WORKFLOWS

## Overview
The WORKFLOWS feature centralizes the automation and orchestration of CI/CD processes, GitHub workflow integrations, and changelog management. It leverages the strengths of the repository as a demo template for automated GitHub workflows from agentic‑lib. This feature provides a unified interface to trigger automated testing, build steps, live monitoring, and Git commit hooks, enhancing continuous integration and deployment capabilities.

## Core Functionalities
- **Automated CI/CD Triggers:**
  - Integrate with GitHub Actions to automatically run tests and benchmarks on new commits.
  - Invoke build and deployment scripts via CLI flags (e.g., `--build-intermediate`, `--build-enhanced`).

- **Changelog & Documentation Updates:**
  - Monitor schema changes and automatically generate changelogs using Git commit hooks.
  - Auto-update documentation with real-time report exports in Markdown, HTML, and PDF.

- **HTTP & CLI Integration:**
  - Expose a lightweight HTTP endpoint to trigger workflow actions remotely.
  - Provide CLI commands to manually invoke testing, benchmarking, and changelog updates.

- **Performance Monitoring & Analytics:**
  - Track key performance indicators including build times, test latencies, and workflow success rates.
  - Generate exportable metrics in JSON/CSV format for integration with external dashboards.

## Implementation & Testing
- **Single-File Library:** Implement the core logic in a dedicated file (e.g., `src/lib/workflows.js`) keeping dependencies minimal and ensuring easy integration.
- **Integration with Existing Modules:**
  - Coordinate with SCHEMA_MANAGER for schema diff operations.
  - Leverage aspects of the current INTERFACE_MANAGER and REPORTING features to consolidate user interactions.
- **Testing:**
  - Extend unit tests and integration tests to simulate CI triggers, HTTP endpoint invocations, and Git commit hooks.
  - Validate both normal and edge-case scenarios, ensuring smooth operation across environments.

## Value Proposition
By automating the build, test, and deployment processes directly within the repository, the WORKFLOWS feature boosts the development cycle’s efficiency. It aligns with our mission of simplifying API change management by providing proactive, automated feedback on schema evolution, and supports a self-evolving agentic coding system with reliable, continuous integration and deployment.
