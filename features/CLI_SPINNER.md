# CLI_SPINNER

## Overview
This feature introduces an interactive spinner to improve user experience for long-running CLI tasks in the repository. By integrating a spinner using the `ora` library, users receive visual feedback during operations that take longer to complete, such as parallel command execution or extended diagnostics. This enhancement aligns with the mission of transparent automation and intelligent feedback.

## Implementation Details
1. **Spinner Integration in Main CLI**
   - Import the `ora` library at the top of `src/lib/main.js`.
   - Introduce a new CLI flag `--spinner` which, when included, activates the spinner during any non-trivial command execution.
   - For commands that may have a higher processing time (e.g. `--replication` tasks or diagnostics), wrap the core logic with spinner start and stop calls:
     ```js
     import ora from 'ora';
     // ... inside main function, before processing a long task:
     const spinner = ora('Processing...').start();
     // Execute the core logic
     // ... after processing, stop spinner
     spinner.succeed('Done');
     ```

2. **Non-Intrusive Behavior**
   - Ensure that the spinner does not interfere when the CLI tool is used without `--spinner`. The spinner should only activate when explicitly requested or when a command takes longer than a specified threshold.
   
3. **Testing Adjustments**
   - Update tests in `tests/unit/main.test.js` to simulate CLI calls with the `--spinner` flag. Use mocks or spies to assert that spinner methods (`start`, `succeed`, etc.) are called.
   - Ensure test outputs strip spinner-related log artifacts to verify correctness of the core CLI functionality.

4. **Documentation Updates (README.md)**
   - Add a new section to document the `--spinner` flag. Explain that when activated, a spinner will provide visual progress feedback during longer operations.
   - Provide examples, such as:
     ```bash
     node src/lib/main.js --spinner --diagnostics
     ```

5. **Dependency Updates**
   - Add `ora` as a dependency to `package.json` (e.g. "ora": "^6.1.0").
   - Ensure the dependency installation and version meet our Node 20 and ESM standards.

## Long-Term Direction
The introduction of an interactive spinner paves the way for additional user interface enhancements in the CLI, such as progress bars for batch operations, dynamic logging feedback, and more granular status updates. This feature supports the mission of autonomous automation by making long-running tasks more transparent and user-friendly.
