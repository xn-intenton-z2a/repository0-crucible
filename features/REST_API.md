# REST_API Enhancement

## Overview
This feature upgrades the existing REST API functionality by adding additional endpoints as outlined in our documentation. In addition to the basic root endpoint, the updated REST API will now support:

- A GET endpoint at `/ontologies` to return a list of available OWL ontologies.
- A GET endpoint at `/ontologies/:id` to return the details of a specific ontology.
- A POST endpoint at `/ontologies/refresh` to trigger a refresh and regeneration of ontology data.
- A new GET endpoint at `/health` to serve as a quick health check for the service.

This update aligns with our mission to expose programmatic access to OWL ontologies and improve developer and integration experiences.

## Implementation Details
- **HTTP Server:**
  - Update the `serve` function in `src/lib/main.js` to establish additional routes.
  - Implement the `/ontologies` route to simulate a list of ontology IDs (or dummy ontology objects).
  - Implement the `/ontologies/:id` route to return details for a specific ontology (using dummy data for now).
  - Implement the `/ontologies/refresh` route that triggers a simulated refresh of ontology data and returns the updated data in JSON format.
  - Implement a new `/health` endpoint that returns a JSON object (e.g., `{ status: "ok" }`) to indicate that the service is running.

- **CLI Integration:**
  - Ensure that when the `--serve` flag is provided, the server starts with the enhanced routes.

- **Testing Enhancements:**
  - Update `tests/unit/main.test.js` to add new test cases for the added endpoints, including verifying the response structure and status codes.
  - Ensure integration tests check that the `/health` endpoint returns the expected JSON output.

- **Documentation Updates:**
  - Revise `README.md` to document the new API endpoints and provide usage examples for them.
  - Update `CONTRIBUTING.md` with guidelines on testing and extending REST API endpoints.

## Future Considerations
- Enhance the routing logic to fetch and manage real ontology data.
- Add security measures (e.g., API key authentication) for sensitive endpoints.
- Monitor performance and add logging/metrics where applicable.
