# Issue Generator

This feature introduces an automated mechanism to generate detailed GitHub issues by leveraging the Chat Completions API. It enables maintainers to quickly obtain a series of well-structured issue descriptions for implementing new functionality or updating existing features. This aligns with the mission of rapidly building and iterating upon live, verified public data integration tools.

## Overview

- **Automated Issue Generation:** Submit descriptive prompts to the Chat Completions API to generate a series of actionable GitHub issues.
- **Template Customization:** Allow users to define custom prompt templates and parameters to influence the issue generation style and content.
- **CLI Integration:** Expose a new CLI command (e.g., `--gen-issues`) to trigger the issue generation process, with options for specifying prompt details or template names.
- **Traceability:** Include diagnostic logging to capture the details of API interactions and the resulting generated issues.
- **Configuration:** Support environment variable overrides and CLI flags to control aspects such as API key, prompt template selection, and output formatting.

## Implementation Details

- **API Integration Module:** Create a new module (e.g., `src/lib/issueGenerator.js`) that encapsulates the logic for calling the Chat Completions API (using the OpenAI dependency) with a provided prompt.
- **CLI Command:** Add a new CLI flag (e.g., `--gen-issues`) within the main CLI dispatcher to allow users to trigger the issue generation process. The command will accept parameters for custom prompt or template names.
- **Prompt Template Management:** Provide a default prompt template that describes the repository context, current feature set, and implementation guidelines. Allow users to override this template via environment variable (e.g., `ISSUE_TEMPLATE`) or CLI options.
- **Logging and Diagnostics:** Integrate with the existing diagnostic logging mechanism to report API call status, any errors returned from the Chat Completions API, and a summary of the generated issues.
- **Output Format:** Return the generated issues in a structured JSON format that can either be directly submitted to GitHub or further processed to create issues via the GitHub API.

## Testing

- **Unit Tests:** Create tests to simulate various responses from the Chat Completions API, verifying that the module returns correctly structured issue objects given a descriptive prompt.
- **Integration Tests:** Ensure that when the `--gen-issues` CLI command is invoked, the output is a list of issue descriptions that match repository style guidelines, and that the diagnostic logs contain appropriate details.
- **Edge Cases:** Test behavior when the API returns errors, when invalid prompt parameters are supplied, and when custom templates are used.

This feature extends the automation capabilities of the repository, enabling efficient issue creation for iterative development while ensuring adherence to the repository guidelines and mission objectives.
