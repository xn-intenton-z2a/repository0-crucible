# Issue Generator

This feature introduces an automated workflow to generate GitHub issues using a Chat Completions API. By submitting a prompt through the CLI or other integration points, the system activates a conversation with the API and returns a series of well-structured issues. This allows maintainers to iterate on features, refactor tasks, and document required enhancements effectively.

# Overview

- **Automated Issue Creation:** Submit a feature description or prompt which is processed via the Chat Completions API to create a list of actionable GitHub issues.
- **Structured Output:** The generated issues include titles, detailed descriptions, implementation steps, and testing recommendations adhering to repository guidelines.
- **CLI Integration:** Introduce a dedicated CLI flag (e.g., `--generate-issues`) that accepts a prompt and triggers the issue generation module.
- **Configuration Options:** Allow users to define parameters such as model choice, temperature, and output formatting via environment variables or CLI options.

# Implementation Details

- **API Integration Module:** Create a new module (e.g., `src/lib/issueGenerator.js`) which packages the user’s feature prompt, submits it to the Chat Completions endpoint, and parses the response to generate a list of issues.
- **CLI Command:** Extend the CLI to accept a flag like `--generate-issues "Your feature description"` that calls the new module. The command should handle errors and provide fallback messaging if the API call fails.
- **Formatting & Validation:** Ensure that the returned issues adhere to the repository’s issue template and include sections for Implementation, Testing, and Diagnostics.
- **Documentation:** Update README and CONTRIBUTING files to include guidance on how to use the Issue Generator and how to incorporate the generated issues into development workflow.

# Testing

- **Unit Tests:** Write tests for the issue generation module by mocking the Chat Completions API response and verifying that the output is correctly parsed into GitHub issue format.
- **CLI Integration Tests:** Simulate CLI usage with various prompts, including empty or malformed inputs, to ensure robust error handling and proper issue generation.
- **Edge Cases:** Test scenarios where the API might return unexpected outputs or network failures, ensuring graceful degradation and clear diagnostic logs.

This feature aligns with the mission of delivering live and interactive feedback to developers, augmenting the development cycle by quickly transforming high-level ideas into actionable GitHub issues.
