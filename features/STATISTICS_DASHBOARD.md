# Statistics Dashboard

## Overview
This feature provides a real-time statistics dashboard that aggregates and presents key performance metrics from live data fetch operations. It tracks metrics such as the number of API fetch attempts, success and failure rates, average response delays, and jitter. This real-time view helps users assess endpoint performance, identify network issues, and optimize live data integration processes.

## Implementation Details
- **Metrics Collection:** Extend the existing diagnostic logging and fetch retry mechanisms to capture relevant data, including:
  - Number of fetch attempts per endpoint
  - Success and failure counts
  - Average delay and jitter values computed during exponential backoff
  - Endpoint-specific performance summaries
- **Data Aggregation Module:** Create a new module (e.g., `src/lib/statisticsDashboard.js`) that aggregates these metrics in real-time, storing them temporarily in an in-memory store or lightweight database.
- **Web Interface:** Integrate a dedicated web page within the existing web server (or via a new CLI flag, e.g., `--stats`) that visualizes these metrics using graphical libraries such as Chart.js or D3.js. The dashboard should update dynamically as new metrics are logged.
- **CLI Integration:** Add a CLI command (e.g., `--stats`) that outputs a textual summary of the current statistics, enabling quick checks directly from the terminal.
- **Configuration:** Allow users to customize the refresh interval, select specific metrics to display, and filter results via environment variables or CLI options.

## Testing
- **Unit Tests:** Write tests to ensure that metrics are correctly captured and aggregated during various fetch operations, including handling retries with exponential backoff.
- **Integration Tests:** Simulate live data fetches (using mocked endpoints) to verify that the real-time dashboard updates correctly in both the web interface and CLI output.
- **Edge Cases:** Test scenarios such as high-frequency fetch failures and network disruptions to ensure robust performance and accurate metric logging.

This feature complements the mission of owl-builder by offering enhanced observability of live data integration, empowering developers to troubleshoot and fine-tune performance in real-time.
