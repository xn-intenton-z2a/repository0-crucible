# USER_INTERFACE

## Overview
This feature upgrades the CLI experience by integrating enhanced interactive help with robust input validation. It ensures that when users pass unexpected or unknown flags, a clear message is presented along with guidance on valid options. This consolidation improves user experience by combining the interactive help capabilities of the existing HELP_SEEKING feature with additional input validation, ultimately aligning with our mission of intelligent collaboration and practical automation.

## Implementation Details
- **Flag Validation:** Update the main source file (`src/lib/main.js`) to check each CLI argument against a known set of flags (e.g. `--help`, `--version`, `--diagnostics`, `--serve`, `--build-intermediate`, `--build-enhanced`, `--refresh`, `--merge-persist`).
  - If an unknown flag is detected, the program will output a warning message indicating the unrecognized option and then display the help text.
  - Ensure that existing logic for recognized flags remains unaffected.

- **Interactive Help Integration:** Leverage the current help functionality to serve both as guidance and as feedback when input validation fails. The help display should remain accessible via `--help` or `--assist` flags, and now will also be triggered for unrecognized inputs.

- **Testing Updates:**
  - In the test file (`tests/unit/main.test.js`), add new unit tests that simulate passing an unknown flag. Verify that the output contains a warning about the unrecognized flag along with the standard help message.
  - Ensure that tests still pass for recognized flags such as `--help` and `--version`.

- **Documentation Updates:**
  - Modify the README (`README.md`) to include a new section under CLI Options that explains the input validation behavior. Provide examples showing that when an unknown flag is used, the CLI outputs a descriptive error and displays the help instructions.

## Long-Term Direction
This enhanced user interface lays the groundwork for a more comprehensive CLI experience. Future iterations could include more granular error messages, suggestions for correct flag usage, and dynamic help content based on the currently active features. By centralizing interactive help and input validation into the USER_INTERFACE feature, the system will become more intuitive and accessible to developers, echoing the mission of continuous refinement and intelligent collaboration.
