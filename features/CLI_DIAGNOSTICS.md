# CLI_DIAGNOSTICS Feature Specification

## Overview
This feature introduces a diagnostics functionality to the CLI tool. When the `--diagnostics` flag is provided, the application will output relevant system and environment information, including Node.js version, environment variables, and other configuration details that aid in troubleshooting.

## Implementation Details
- **Source File Update (src/lib/main.js):**
  - Extend the argument parser to detect the `--diagnostics` flag.
  - When the flag is present, execute a diagnostics routine that collects system information such as the Node.js version, current environment variables, and other runtime details.
  - Ensure that if other recognized flags (like `--help`) are present, the corresponding actions are executed without conflicts.

- **Test File Update (tests/unit/main.test.js):**
  - Add test cases to verify that running the CLI with the `--diagnostics` flag produces the expected diagnostic output.
  - Ensure that the new functionality does not interfere with the existing help functionality.

- **README File Update (README.md):**
  - Add a new section under "Usage" documenting the `--diagnostics` command with usage examples and expected output.

- **Dependencies File Update (package.json):**
  - No new dependencies are required. The implementation will rely on standard Node.js APIs to retrieve diagnostics information.

## Goals
- Enhance the user experience by providing a built-in mechanism to inspect the tool's operating environment.
- Support troubleshooting and debugging efforts without external tooling.
- Stay consistent with the mission of creating a robust CLI tool for managing OWL ontologies.
