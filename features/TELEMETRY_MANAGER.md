# TELEMETRY_MANAGER

This feature centralizes and enhances the diagnostic telemetry functionalities across owl-builder. It is designed to aggregate, batch, and export telemetry data—particularly related to environment variable normalization warnings and other diagnostic events—providing users and maintainers with a unified interface for monitoring system health and performance.

## Overview

- **Centralized Telemetry Aggregation:** Collect all diagnostic warnings (e.g., NaN fallback events) and operational telemetry from various modules into a unified system.
- **Batching & Debounce Mechanism:** Leverage debouncing to efficiently batch rapid telemetry events, reducing logging noise while preserving essential diagnostic data.
- **Flexible Export Options:** Provide CLI commands to export aggregated telemetry in multiple formats (JSON and CSV) for further analysis and reporting.
- **Enhanced Diagnostic Summary:** Generate detailed summaries that include timestamps, occurrence counts, and contextual metadata for each aggregated telemetry event.

## Implementation Details

1. **Telemetry Aggregation:**
   - Integrate with existing inline logging functions to capture NaN fallback warnings and other diagnostic logs.
   - Use a Map or similar data structure to track unique telemetry events and their counts.

2. **Batching & Debouncing:**
   - Implement a debounced flush mechanism that batches rapid, successive messages, ensuring that the telemetry system remains performant under high concurrency.

3. **CLI Integration:**
   - Extend existing CLI commands (e.g., `--export-telemetry` and `--diagnostic-summary-naN`) to utilize the centralized telemetry manager.
   - Allow users to choose export formats via CLI flags (e.g., `--format csv` for CSV and defaulting to JSON).

4. **Diagnostic Summary Reporting:**
   - Generate summaries that include key details such as event counts, timestamps, and environment variable values.
   - Ensure that the telemetry manager reports are aligned with the overall diagnostic strategies outlined in CONTRIBUTING.md.

## Benefits

- **Improved Observability:** Users can easily access detailed diagnostic information to troubleshoot issues related to environment configuration and runtime errors.
- **Performance Optimizations:** By batching and debouncing telemetry events, system performance is maintained even under conditions of high diagnostic load.
- **Ease of Reporting:** Flexible export options simplify integration with external monitoring tools and reporting dashboards.
- **Enhanced Maintainability:** A centralized telemetry system reduces code duplication and streamlines the maintenance of diagnostic and logging functionalities.
