# SIMULATE_LOAD Feature Specification

## Overview
This feature introduces a simulated load capability for the CLI tool. By providing the --simulate-load flag with a numeric value in milliseconds, users can test how the program behaves under prolonged CPU load conditions. This is especially useful for diagnosing performance issues and for stress testing parts of the CLI tool that interact with resource-intensive operations.

## Implementation
The changes will be applied in the allowed files as follows:
- In the src/lib/main.js file:
  - Add "--simulate-load" to the list of supported flags.
  - When the flag is detected, verify a valid numeric value follows it. If the value is missing or invalid, display an appropriate error message and the help instructions.
  - Once a valid value is provided, simulate load via a busy-wait loop or a CPU-intensive operation that runs for at least the provided number of milliseconds. After completing the simulated load, continue processing the remaining CLI flags normally.

- In the tests/unit/main.test.js file:
  - Add a new test case for the --simulate-load flag. Utilize time measurement to assert that the CPU load simulation takes at least the expected number of milliseconds.
  - Include tests for invalid or missing load values to confirm that errors are handled gracefully.

- In the README.md and docs/USAGE.md files:
  - Update the CLI usage documentation to include a description of the --simulate-load flag, its purpose, and usage examples.

## Testing
Tests will verify the following scenarios:
- Providing a valid numeric load value results in the CLI tool executing a busy-wait for the specified duration before proceeding.
- Using an invalid value (or no value) triggers an error message and displays the help instructions.

This feature enhances the diagnostic and testing capabilities of the CLI tool, aligning with the repository mission to provide robust troubleshooting and performance testing tools in a single repository build.
