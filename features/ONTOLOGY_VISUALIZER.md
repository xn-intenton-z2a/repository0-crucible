# Ontology Visualizer & Diagnostic Dashboard

This feature enhances the existing ontology visualization tool with a unified, interactive interface that not only displays the live-built ontology graph but also integrates an advanced diagnostic and telemetry dashboard panel. The updated module now aggregates real-time system logs, environment telemetry events (such as NaN fallback occurrences), and diagnostic messages. This creates a comprehensive overview of both the ontology data and the internal system health.

## Overview

- **Interactive Graph Display:** Continue to render the live-built ontology as a dynamic network graph. The graph supports zooming, panning, and node selection to aid in exploration of ontology entities and relationships.

- **Diagnostic Dashboard Panel:** Present a dedicated section adjacent to the graph that streams diagnostic logs, telemetry events, and error/warning messages. The panel allows filtering by log level and time stamps to quickly identify issues.

- **Telemetry Aggregator:** Integrate a telemetry sub-panel that collects structured telemetry events generated during environment variable parsing and other fallback operations. This module aggregates events such as non-numeric environment variable inputs and presents metrics (e.g., frequency counts, timestamps) to help diagnose recurring configuration issues.

- **Real-Time Updates:** Leverage socket connections or long polling to update both the ontology graph and the diagnostic/telemetry panels in real time. This dynamic binding ensures that users always see current data and diagnostic feedback.

- **User-Driven Controls:** Offer CLI and in-UI toggles to switch between views (ontology graph, diagnostic logs, telemetry aggregator) and to export diagnostic or telemetry summaries as JSON reports for offline review.

## Implementation Details

- **Extended Module:** Update the existing visualization module (e.g., `src/lib/ontologyVisualizer.js`) to incorporate additional UI sections that render the diagnostic logs and telemetry events. Maintain the interactive graph while introducing new panels for diagnostics and aggregated telemetry.

- **Telemetry Collection:** Modify the environment variable parsing and diagnostic logging functions to emit structured telemetry events (such as NaN fallback warnings) in JSON format. The interface will capture these events and store them in an in-memory aggregator that can be filtered and exported.

- **UI Enhancements:** Add user interface controls for toggling panels, applying filters (by log level, event type, or time range), and exporting a summarized telemetry report. Ensure that both the diagnostic logs and telemetry data are clearly labeled and accessible within the unified dashboard.

- **CLI Integration:** Extend the existing CLI flag (e.g., `--visualize`) to support the new telemetry aggregation functionality. Provide additional CLI options (like `--export-telemetry`) to dump the collected telemetry data into a JSON file.

- **Testing & Validation:** Develop unit and integration tests to verify that the interactive graph, diagnostic logs, and telemetry aggregator function correctly and update in real time. Test the export functionality and ensure that diagnostic and telemetry filters work as expected across various data load scenarios.

## Testing & Diagnostics

- **Unit Tests:** Validate that the visualization module renders both the ontology and the diagnostic panels, and that telemetry events are correctly captured and aggregated.

- **Integration Tests:** Utilize headless browser tests to ensure that UI controls for switching views and filtering logs are operational and that CLI flags properly trigger the telemetry export feature.

- **Performance & Edge Cases:** Test the dashboard with a variety of ontology sizes and telemetry volumes to ensure the interface remains responsive and accurate under stress.

This enhancement aligns with the mission to deliver live, verified data insights coupled with robust diagnostic feedback. By integrating telemetry aggregation, the Ontology Visualizer now empowers developers to promptly identify and address configuration issues, improving overall system reliability and maintainability.
