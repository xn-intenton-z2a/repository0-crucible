# Ontology Visualizer

This feature introduces an interactive visualization layer to the owl-builder tool. It dynamically renders the generated ontology in a graphical format, enabling users to quickly preview, navigate, and analyze the structure of OWL ontologies. The visual representation will help users understand the relationships between components (concepts, classes, properties, and metadata) and aid in troubleshooting and iterative development.

# Overview

- **Interactive Graphical Display:** Render the current ontology as a network graph where nodes represent ontology entities (e.g., concepts, classes) and edges illustrate their relationships.
- **Real-Time Updates:** As the ontology is built from live data, the visualization will update in real-time or on demand, reflecting the most recent structure from both live and merged static sources.
- **User-Driven Exploration:** Provide capabilities such as zoom, pan, and node selection to inspect details, such as diagnostic logs, endpoint information, and customizations.
- **Integration with CLI and Web Server:** Launch the visualizer as part of the integrated web server or via a dedicated CLI command (e.g., `--visualize`).

# Implementation Details

- **Graph Rendering Module:** Develop a new module (e.g., `src/lib/ontologyVisualizer.js`) that processes the ontology JSON and converts it into a format suitable for graph visualization (using libraries such as D3.js or Cytoscape.js).
- **CLI Command:** Introduce a new CLI flag `--visualize` that either opens a browser window or serves an HTML page from the integrated web server with the ontology graph.
- **Data Binding and Real-Time Updates:** Implement a socket or polling mechanism so that changes in the ontology (refresh, merge, or updates) trigger corresponding updates in the visual display.
- **Configuration & Themes:** Allow users to configure basic visualization parameters (e.g., node colors, layout options) through environment variables or CLI options to match their preference or integrate with diagnostic logging.
- **Diagnostic Integration:** Link nodes to detailed logs or metadata so that clicking a node shows related diagnostic messages, reflecting the unified diagnostic logs described in the mission.

# Testing

- **Unit Tests:** Verify that the visualization module correctly transforms the ontology JSON into a suitable graph data structure.
- **Integration Tests:** Ensure that the `--visualize` CLI command starts the web server and serves the interactive visualization page. Use headless browser tests to check that the page loads and nodes are correctly rendered.
- **Real-Time Update Tests:** Simulate ontology updates and confirm that changes are reflected in the visualization without requiring a full restart.
- **Edge Cases:** Test with minimal, empty, and complex ontologies to guarantee robust and error-free rendering.

This feature complements the mission of providing live, verified data representations by offering a direct, interactive look into the structure and relationships within the generated ontology. It also aids maintainers and users in iterative development, troubleshooting, and feature enhancement planning.
