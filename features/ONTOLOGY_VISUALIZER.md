# Ontology Visualizer & Diagnostic Dashboard Enhancement

This update enhances the existing Ontology Visualizer feature to not only display an interactive and live-updated ontology graph along with robust diagnostics, but also to integrate a lightweight HTTP web server interface. This addition allows users and developers to access ontology data, telemetry logs, and diagnostics via simple API endpoints, thereby improving monitoring, remote access, and real-time status checks.

## Overview

- **Interactive Graph Display:** Continues to render live OWL ontologies with zooming, panning, and node selection. 
- **Enhanced Diagnostic Dashboard:** Streams structured diagnostics including environment variable parsing logs, telemetry events, and error/warning notifications in real time.
- **Web Server Integration:** Introduces a minimal HTTP API enabling retrieval of the current ontology, diagnostics summary, and sanitized telemetry data. This interface leverages existing functions (e.g., `serveWebServer` and `startWebServer`) and exposes endpoints for health checks and data queries.

## New Additions

- **HTTP API Endpoints:** 
  - GET `/` returns a simple status message indicating the server is running.
  - GET `/ontology` fetches the current ontology JSON data.
  - GET `/diagnostics` returns a summarized diagnostic log (timestamped messages, telemetry events, etc.).
- **Integration with Existing Real-Time Data:** When the visual interface is active, the web server provides a non-visual alternative to query live data and review diagnostics remotely.
- **Configuration via CLI and Environment Variables:** Maintain existing CLI flags while offering additional configuration (e.g., port configuration, logging level) for the HTTP service.

## Implementation Details

- Update the visualization module (e.g., `src/lib/ontologyVisualizer.js`) to incorporate hooks for web API calls.
- Enhance the main CLI tool to support new commands (e.g., `--serve` already exists) and document usage examples in README.
- Leverage the existing diagnostic functions (`logDiagnostic`, `enhancedDiagnosticSummary`) to compile and expose diagnostic data in JSON format through the API endpoints.

## Testing & QA

- **Unit Tests:** Extend current tests to simulate HTTP requests against the web server endpoints, verifying correct status codes and response formats.
- **Integration Tests:** Use headless tests to ensure that the server starts correctly and that endpoints return valid ontology and diagnostic data.
- **Performance & Security:** Confirm that the lightweight server does not degrade overall performance and that sensitive diagnostic information is appropriately sanitized before exposure.

This enhancement aligns with the mission of providing live data insights and robust diagnostics, while also improving accessibility and remote monitoring capabilities for developers and system administrators.
