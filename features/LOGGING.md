# LOGGING Feature

## Overview
This feature introduces a centralized logging mechanism to track and store log events from all major operations in the repository. It covers CLI interactions, merged HTTP endpoints (from CLI_PARSER and HTTP_SERVER), and SCHEMA_DIFF operations. The aim is to provide configurable and consistent logging that aids in debugging, monitoring, and auditing, all while keeping the repository lean and focused.

## Functionality
- **Centralized Logging Engine**:
  - Capture log events from CLI commands, HTTP requests, and schema diff processing.
  - Support multiple log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR) configurable via environment variables.
- **Log Formatting & Storage**:
  - Standardize logs with timestamps, severity levels, and contextual information.
  - Enable logging to both console and file, with optional extension to external log services.
- **Integration**:
  - Seamlessly integrate logging into the merged INTERFACE module (combining CLI and HTTP functionalities) as well as SCHEMA_DIFF operations.
  - Provide utility functions in a dedicated file (e.g. `src/lib/logger.js`) that all modules can import.
- **Testing & Validation**:
  - Develop unit tests to confirm that log outputs are correctly formatted and captured under various scenarios.
  - Validate log configurations and ensure minimal performance overhead.

## Implementation
- **Module Creation**:
  - Create `src/lib/logger.js` containing the logging library using Node's built-in capabilities.
- **Module Integration**:
  - Refactor existing CLI and HTTP related code (from CLI_PARSER and HTTP_SERVER features) to use the new logging utilities.
  - Update SCHEMA_DIFF module to emit log events for diff operations and AI explanations.
- **Configuration & Documentation**:
  - Allow configuration of log levels and output targets via environment variables and/or a config file.
  - Update README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md with detailed usage examples and configuration instructions.

## Value Proposition
By centralizing logging, the repository will benefit from improved traceability, easier debugging, and enhanced monitoring of all operations. This aligns with our mission of simplifying API evolution by providing clear, actionable insights into the tool's behavior.
