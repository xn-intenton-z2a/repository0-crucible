# SIMULATE_DELAY Feature Specification

## Overview
This feature introduces a simulated delay functionality to the CLI tool. Using a new flag, --simulate-delay, users can specify a delay in milliseconds before the tool carries out its normal processing. This feature allows for testing of asynchronous scenarios and can help in diagnosing timing related issues without affecting the overall error handling and flow.

## Implementation
The following updates will be made in the permitted files:

- In the src/lib/main.js file:
  - Add "--simulate-delay" to the list of supported flags.
  - When the flag is encountered, verify that a valid numeric value follows it. If the value is missing or invalid, trigger an error message and display help instructions.
  - If a valid millisecond value is provided, use a timer (setTimeout) to delay further execution of CLI processing. After the delay, continue processing with the default flag behavior.

- In the tests/unit/main.test.js file:
  - Add a new test case for the --simulate-delay flag. Use a method to simulate or fake timers if possible to assert that the CLI processing is delayed by the correct amount of time.
  - Verify that a delay value which is not numeric generates an appropriate error message.

- In the README.md and docs/USAGE.md files:
  - Update the CLI usage documentation to include the new --simulate-delay flag with a description of its purpose and usage examples.

## Testing
Unit tests will cover the following scenarios:

- Passing a valid numeric delay in milliseconds. Ensure that the tool waits for the specified delay before proceeding with its usual flag processing.
- Passing an invalid delay value (for example, a non-numeric string) should trigger an error message and exit.
- The test should simulate environment conditions using available test helpers or fake timers provided by Vitest, ensuring that the delay does not slow down automated testing.

This feature enhances the diagnostic capabilities of the CLI tool and aligns with our mission to provide robust troubleshooting tools in a single repository setting.
