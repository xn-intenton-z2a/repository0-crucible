# Enhanced Styling

## Overview
This feature refines and extends the existing STYLING capability by leveraging Chalk's advanced method chaining and configuration options. The agentâ€™s CLI output will now use not only basic colorization but also dynamic style enhancements (such as bold, underline, hex and RGB color support) that adapt based on the environment (e.g. TTY detection) and message context (e.g. errors, info, warnings).

## Implementation Details
- **Source File Update:**
  - In `src/lib/main.js`, import the Chalk library using ES Module syntax: `import chalk from 'chalk';`.
  - Update the logging logic to wrap standard output messages with enhanced styling. For example, if the command line arguments include `--error`, output a message styled with `chalk.bold.red`; for informational messages, use `chalk.green`, and for warnings, employ a combination like `chalk.hex('#FFA500')` (orange).
  - Integrate TTY detection by checking `process.stdout.isTTY` to conditionally apply color styling.

- **Test File Update:**
  - In `tests/unit/main.test.js`, augment tests to simulate CLI invocations with flags (e.g. `--error`, `--info`) and verify that the output includes ANSI escape sequences (indicative of Chalk styling).
  - Add expectations to confirm that styled messages, such as those produced with `chalk.bold`, are correctly rendered in the console log output.

- **README Update:**
  - Update `README.md` to document the enhanced styling feature. Include an explanation of how the CLI now provides richer visual feedback using advanced Chalk features, along with examples of the styled outputs. Provide sample command invocations and describe the automatic fallback in non-TTY environments.

- **Dependencies File Update:**
  - Modify `package.json` to add Chalk as a dependency (e.g. "chalk": "^5.0.0"). This ensures that the latest features of Chalk are available for use by the enhanced styling commands.

## Testing and Compatibility
- Verify via unit tests that ANSI escape codes appear in the output when styling is enabled.
- Ensure that in non-TTY environments (or when a FORCE_COLOR environment variable is not set), the agent automatically disables styling to maintain compatibility.

## Long-Term Considerations
This enhancement lays the groundwork for future styling improvements, such as dynamic theming and context-sensitive message formatting, making the CLI not only more informative but also visually intuitive.
