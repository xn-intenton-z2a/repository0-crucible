# TIME_LOG

## Overview
This feature enhances the CLI tool by adding execution time logging. The agent will record the start time when the command is initiated and calculate the total execution duration when it completes. Optionally, when the `--time` flag is provided among the command-line arguments, the CLI will output detailed timing information. This capability aids in performance diagnostics and serves as a stepping stone towards more advanced self-improvement metrics.

## Implementation Details
- **Source File Update (src/lib/main.js):**
  - At the beginning of the `main()` function, record a timestamp (e.g. using `Date.now()`).
  - After executing the CLI logic, compute the elapsed time and log this duration.
  - If `--time` is detected in the arguments, print detailed timing information; otherwise, log a simple message with the total execution time.

- **Test File Update (tests/unit/main.test.js):**
  - Add a test case that simulates running `main()` with the `--time` flag.
  - Capture the console output and verify that it includes a valid execution duration (e.g., a numeric value or a message containing the word "ms").

- **README Update (README.md):**
  - Document the new `--time` flag and provide an example command, such as:
    ```bash
    node src/lib/main.js --time
    ```
  - Explain that this flag enables detailed execution time logging to assist with performance insights.

- **Dependencies File Update (package.json):**
  - No additional dependencies are required for this feature.

## Testing & Compatibility
- Run `npm test` to ensure that the timing log output is correctly produced in both default and `--time` modes.
- Confirm that the default behavior remains unchanged when the flag is omitted.

## Long-Term Considerations
This modest enhancement lays the groundwork for more comprehensive self-improvement features, such as tracking performance metrics over multiple runs or integrating with diagnostic dashboards.
