# CORE_ENGINE: Unified Live Data, Diagnostics, Telemetry, Query & Recovery Engine

## Overview
The CORE_ENGINE remains the backbone of owl-builder and is responsible for integrating live data ingestion, anomaly detection, diagnostic logging, telemetry aggregation, and recovery mechanisms. This engine now features an enhanced environment variable parsing and telemetry batching subsystem that provides robust handling of configuration values, ensuring that non-numeric or malicious inputs are safely managed and logged.

## Live Data Integration & Anomaly Detection
- **Live Data Ingestion:** Continuously fetch data from trusted public endpoints with retry mechanisms, exponential backoff, and a caching layer to optimize performance.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Validate fetched data against expected schemas. Trigger detailed diagnostic messages and initiate automated rollback when anomalies (e.g., missing or empty `entries`) are detected.

## Diagnostics, Telemetry & Environment Variable Parsing
- **Enhanced Diagnostics:** Log every significant event with timestamped messages. Detailed logs include both successful operations and error warnings for immediate troubleshooting.
- **Aggregated Telemetry:** Batch and export diagnostic telemetry (including NaN fallback events) via CLI commands. Support for both JSON and CSV export formats is maintained.
- **Environment Variable Parsing:** Newly refined parsing utilities now normalize environment variables by trimming and collapsing whitespace, converting edge-case variants of 'NaN' (including " nAn " and non-breaking space variants) into a standardized form. Explicit non-numeric inputs are logged distinctly and fallback to default values, all while aggregating warnings to prevent log flooding.

## Live Data Caching, Backup & Recovery
- **Caching:** Implement an in-memory caching mechanism for live data fetches with a configurable TTL. Redundant API calls are minimized by reusing recent data while ensuring fresh fetches once the TTL expires.
- **Backup & Automated Rollback:** Regular backups are created and stored. On detecting data anomalies, the engine attempts to restore the last known good backup, with real-time WebSocket notifications indicating rollback status.

## Query, Validation & Persistence
- **Ontology Querying:** Rapid search and validation of ontology concepts via CLI and HTTP/GraphQL interfaces.
- **Data Persistence:** Methods to export ontologies in OWL XML format, as well as clear, merge, and update operations that maintain consistent data structures during live updates.

## Web Server and CLI Integration
- **Unified Interface:** Although the CORE_ENGINE handles backend processes, it integrates with the unified CLI and HTTP/GraphQL interfaces. This ensures that diagnostic logs, telemetry data, and live updates are readily available through a consistent user interface.
- **Real-Time Notifications:** On key events—such as live data refresh, merge, or rollback—WebSocket notifications are broadcast with details including the updated ontology title, version, and status messages.

## Benefits
- **Reliability & Maintainability:** Enhanced environment variable parsing reduces runtime configuration issues and improves system resilience.
- **Actionable Diagnostics:** Comprehensive and aggregated telemetry ensures that developers gain immediate insight into system health and configuration anomalies.
- **Optimized Performance:** With robust caching and automated recovery mechanisms, the CORE_ENGINE ensures that owl-builder delivers up-to-date ontologies without sacrificing reliability.
