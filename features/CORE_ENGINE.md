# CORE_ENGINE: Unified Live Data, Scheduling, Diagnostics, Telemetry, and RDF Export Engine

## Overview
This feature remains the backbone of owl-builder by integrating live data ingestion, anomaly detection, automated rollback, and comprehensive diagnostic logging with scheduled maintenance and CLI command integrations. In this update, CORE_ENGINE has been extended to include RDF export capabilities. This allows users to seamlessly convert their ontologies from JSON into standard RDF/Turtle (or optionally RDF/XML) formats, aligning owl-builder with common semantic web practices and enhancing interoperability.

## Implementation Details
1. **Live Data Integration & Anomaly Detection:**
   - Continues to ingest live data from verified public endpoints and validate incoming data against expected schemas.
   - Triggers diagnostic logging and automated rollback using the last known good backup upon anomaly detection.
   - Broadcasts real-time WebSocket notifications with fields such as `updatedOntologyTitle`, `version`, `timestamp`, and `statusMessage`.

2. **Diagnostic Logging & Telemetry:**
   - Aggregates diagnostic logs including environment variable warnings and detailed telemetry export events.
   - Implements debounced telemetry batching with configurable flush delays.
   - Provides CLI commands (e.g., `--export-telemetry`) to export diagnostic telemetry in JSON or CSV formats.

3. **Scheduled Maintenance & CLI Commands:**
   - Controls scheduled tasks (e.g., ontology refresh and backup) through environment variables and CLI commands (e.g., `--refresh`, `--merge-persist`).
   - Ensures full integration with the web server and interactive CLI menu for quick user feedback.

4. **RDF EXPORT Functionality:**
   - **Purpose:** Convert the current ontology from its JSON representation into RDF/Turtle format. Optionally, support RDF/XML conversion if specified by a CLI flag or parameter.
   - **Implementation:**
        - Implement a conversion function that maps ontology properties (title, concepts, classes, properties, metadata) to RDF triples.
        - Integrate the conversion function into the CLI commands (e.g., extending an export flag like `--export-rdf`) so that users can generate an RDF file (e.g., `ontology.ttl` or `ontology.rdf`).
        - Ensure that the RDF export is consistent with the underlying ontology schema used in owl-builder.
   - **Benefits:**
        - Enhances semantic interoperability by providing standardized RDF output.
        - Facilitates integration with semantic web tools and triple stores.
        - Offers users an extended export option without disrupting the core live data and diagnostic functionalities.

## Migration and Integration Notes
- All existing functionalities (live data integration, anomaly detection, diagnostic logging, scheduled operations, CLI integrations, and web & WebSocket notifications) remain fully operational.
- Documentation including README and CONTRIBUTING files will be updated to introduce the new RDF export options with usage examples.
- No features are removed; this is an additive update to CORE_ENGINE to broaden its export capabilities.
