# CORE_ENGINE: Unified Live Data, Diagnostics, Telemetry, Query & Recovery Engine

## Overview
This feature remains the backbone of owl-builder, integrating live data ingestion, anomaly detection, comprehensive diagnostics, telemetry aggregation, scheduled maintenance, RDF export, in-memory caching, backup/rollback, and enhanced ontology query and validation. It underpins a robust system that seamlessly handles ontology updates through live public data, while ensuring reliable fallback and detailed diagnostic logging.

## Live Data Integration & Anomaly Detection
- **Live Data Ingestion:** Continuously fetches data from verified public endpoints with automated retries, exponential backoff, and caching to optimize performance.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Validates live data against expected schemas. If anomalies (e.g., missing or empty `entries`) are detected, diagnostic logs are triggered and automated rollback is initiated using the last known good backup.

## Telemetry and Diagnostics Management
- **Centralized Logging:** Aggregates detailed diagnostic messages, logging every event with timestamps and severity levels.
- **Aggregated Telemetry:** Implements batching mechanisms for environment variable warnings (e.g., NaN fallback events) to avoid log flooding. Warnings are summarized and accessible via CLI commands.

## Telemetry Export and CLI Integration
- **CLI Telemetry Export:** The tool now supports a dedicated CLI command (`--export-telemetry`) to export aggregated telemetry data in JSON or CSV formats. This feature ensures that detailed diagnostic and telemetry logs—including NaN fallback events—are exportable for further analysis.
- **Usage Details:**
  - **JSON Export (default):** Generates a `telemetry.json` file containing structured telemetry data.
  - **CSV Export:** When using the `--format csv` flag, telemetry data is exported as a CSV file (`telemetry.csv`), including separate sections for NaN fallback warnings and diagnostic summaries.

## Scheduling, RDF Export & Live Data Caching
- **Scheduled Maintenance:** Supports routine operations like backups, refreshes, and merges at configurable intervals.
- **RDF Export:** Converts ontologies into standardized RDF formats, supporting external integrations.
- **Caching Mechanism:** In-memory cache with a configurable TTL ensures optimized performance by reducing redundant API calls during live data fetch operations.

## Backup, Automated Rollback & Recovery
- **Backup Operations:** Regularly saves the current ontology state to a backup file.
- **Automated Rollback:** On detecting data anomalies, the system automatically restores the last known good backup, with clear, timestamped diagnostic logs and real-time WebSocket notifications.

## Query & Validation
- **Ontology Querying:** Provides rapid ontology concept searches via CLI and HTTP/GraphQL interfaces.
- **Data Validation:** Performs strict checks to ensure ontologies are structurally sound and complete.

## Benefits
- **Increased Reliability:** Automated telemetry and diagnostic mechanisms ensure robust handling of live data integration issues.
- **Enhanced Developer Experience:** Detailed CLI feedback, along with exportable telemetry, helps developers quickly diagnose and resolve configuration or runtime issues.
- **Comprehensive Data Management:** Combines real-time data ingestion with fallback strategies, ensuring that ontology data remains accurate and up-to-date.
