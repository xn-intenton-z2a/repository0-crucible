# CORE_ENGINE: Unified Live Data, Scheduling, Diagnostics, and Telemetry Engine

## Overview
This feature consolidates critical functionalities into a single, robust engine. It integrates live data ingestion with anomaly detection and automated rollback, comprehensive diagnostic logging, scheduled maintenance, and enhanced telemetry export capabilities. CORE_ENGINE is the backbone of owl-builder, ensuring resilient ontology management, seamless CLI integration, and real-time web and WebSocket notifications.

## Live Data Integration & Anomaly Detection
- Ingest live data from verified public endpoints as per mission requirements.
- Validate the incoming data against expected schemas (e.g., ensure `entries` is a non-empty array).
- On detection of anomalies, log detailed diagnostics and trigger an automated rollback using the last known good backup.
- Broadcast a WebSocket notification with a clear message (e.g., "Ontology rollback executed due to live data anomaly").

## Diagnostic Logging & Telemetry
- Aggregate diagnostic logs, including warnings for non-numeric environment variable inputs.
- Implement debounced telemetry batching using configurable flush delays.
- Explicitly handle input values normalizing to "nan", logging these as distinct telemetry events and falling back to safe defaults.
- Provide a CLI flag (`--export-telemetry`) that exports aggregated telemetry data in JSON (default) or CSV format, making diagnostics accessible for troubleshooting.

## Scheduled Maintenance & CLI Commands
- Control scheduled tasks (e.g., ontology refresh and backup) through environment variables and CLI commands such as `--refresh` and `--merge-persist`.
- Ensure full integration with other components (e.g., web server notifications and the interactive CLI menu) for real-time feedback and seamless operations.

## Benefits
- **Resilience:** Automated anomaly detection with rollback safeguards ensures high reliability.
- **Unified Management:** Consolidates live data integration, diagnostics, and scheduled operations into one maintainable module.
- **Enhanced Troubleshooting:** Detailed telemetry and diagnostic logs improve visibility into system performance and issues.
- **Consistent User Experience:** Seamlessly integrates with the web server and CLI to provide real-time updates and intuitive control.

## Migration and Integration Notes
- This update consolidates functionalities from the legacy TELEMETRY_MANAGER and ONTOLOGY_ENGINE features, which will be removed.
- Documentation, README, and CONTRIBUTING guidelines will be updated to reflect the enhanced telemetry export and diagnostic capabilities.
- Ensure that any existing integrations remain functional, with the new CORE_ENGINE providing extended value without interfering with the current feature set.
