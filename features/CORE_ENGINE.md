# CORE_ENGINE: Unified Live Data, Diagnostics, Query & Recovery Engine

## Overview
This feature integrates live data ingestion, anomaly detection, comprehensive diagnostics, telemetry aggregation, scheduling, RDF export, in-memory caching, backup/rollback, and now enhanced ontology query and validation. It provides a unified system that ensures data integrity and offers robust mechanisms for live data integration with advanced query capabilities and structural validation of ontologies.

## Live Data Integration & Anomaly Detection
- **Live Data Ingestion:** Continuously fetches live data from verified public endpoints with automated retries and exponential backoff.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Monitors live data for schema inconsistencies, missing data, or empty arrays. Anomalies trigger diagnostic logging and real-time WebSocket alerts.

## Unified Diagnostics, Telemetry & Notifications
- **Centralized Logging:** Consolidates advanced diagnostic messages, including timestamps and log levels. Integrates detailed telemetry export (JSON/CSV) for events like NaN fallback occurrences.
- **Real-Time Notifications:** Broadcasting of ontology update events (refresh, merge, rollback) via WebSocket including version, timestamp, and status messages.

## Scheduling, RDF Export & Live Data Caching
- **Scheduled Maintenance:** Manages routine tasks such as backups, refreshes, and merges with user-configurable intervals.
- **RDF Export:** Converts ontologies into standardized RDF formats for external integrations.
- **Caching Mechanism:** Implements in-memory caching with configurable Time-To-Live (TTL) to optimize live data fetching performance.

## Backup, Automated Rollback & Recovery
- **Backup Mechanism:** Regularly saves the current state of the ontology to a backup file.
- **Automated Rollback:** On detecting data anomalies, initiates an automatic rollback to the last known good backup, supported by detailed diagnostic logs and WebSocket alerts.

## Query & Validation
- **Ontology Query:** Provides a function to search ontology concepts based on user-provided search terms, ensuring rapid retrieval of relevant data.
- **Data Validation:** Implements strict validation checks to ensure that ontologies are structurally correct and contain essential attributes (e.g., non-empty title, valid entries).
- **CLI Integration:** Query and validation functionalities are accessible through both CLI commands and the unified HTTP/GraphQL interface, ensuring seamless user interaction.

## Migration and Backwards Compatibility
- All legacy functions remain supported ensuring a smooth transition for existing users.
- Updated documentation (README and CONTRIBUTING) includes usage examples for query and validation commands.

## Benefits
- **Robust Data Management:** Enhances system reliability with comprehensive diagnostics, automated recovery, and improved query accuracy.
- **Centralized Engine:** Simplifies operational workflows by consolidating live data integration, query operations, and recovery into a single engine.
- **Improved User Experience:** Provides immediate, contextual feedback on system health and facilitates efficient troubleshooting through detailed logs and interactive help.
