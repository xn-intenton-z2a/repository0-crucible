# CONFIG_MANAGER

## Overview
This feature provides a centralized module for managing environment configuration and integrated diagnostic telemetry. It not only standardizes the parsing, normalization, and CLI override precedence for environment variables but also aggregates diagnostic data from invalid or malformed inputs. By consolidating telemetry data—previously scattered across components—into a single, cohesive module, the feature improves maintainability and observability across the repository.

## Features
- **Centralized Parsing & Overrides:** Implements robust normalization (trimming and collapsing of whitespace, including non-breaking spaces) and numeric parsing for environment variables. CLI-provided values always take precedence over environment and fallback values.
- **Integrated Telemetry Aggregation:** Utilizes a promise-based batching mechanism to log a single diagnostic warning per unique invalid input. Each event includes details such as the raw input value, CLI override status, and a timestamp. The aggregated telemetry summary is accessible using the CLI flag `--diagnostic-summary-naN` and can be leveraged for further integration with external monitoring systems.
- **Consistency and Observability:** Provides a unified API (including functions like `normalizeEnvValue`, `parseEnvNumber`, `resetEnvWarningCache`, and `getAggregatedNaNSummary`) to retrieve both configuration values and diagnostic telemetry data, thereby ensuring consistent behavior and rapid troubleshooting.

## Implementation Details
- **Enhanced Utility Functions:** Update and integrate existing helper functions to ensure that any non-numeric or malformed input triggers a single, batched telemetry event.
- **Asynchronous Batching:** Leverages promise-based batching for telemetry flushes under high concurrency to guarantee atomic aggregation of diagnostic warnings.
- **Migration of Telemetry:** Diagnostic telemetry originally embedded in other features (such as the telemetry HTTP endpoint in Ontology Service) is now consolidated in CONFIG_MANAGER. This not only avoids duplication but establishes a single source of truth for configuration-related diagnostics.

## Benefits
- **Improved Maintainability:** By centralizing configuration and telemetry, the codebase becomes easier to maintain and extend.
- **Proactive Diagnostics:** Immediate access to aggregated telemetry helps in quickly identifying and resolving configuration issues.
- **Streamlined Integration:** Other components (like Ontology Service and the Web Dashboard) can rely on a consistent and centralized telemetry API for enhanced observability.
