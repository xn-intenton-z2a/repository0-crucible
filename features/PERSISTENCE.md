# PERSISTENCE Feature

## Overview
This feature introduces a lightweight persistence module for storing and managing the history of JSON schema diffs and changes. It is designed to complement the SCHEMA_TOOL and OBSERVABILITY features by saving diff outputs, enabling historical audits, and supporting rollback operations if needed. The module leverages file-based storage to maintain a record of schema evolutions, hence simplifying debugging and providing a verifiable audit trail.

## Core Functionalities
- **Diff Storage:** Automatically save JSON schema diff outputs to local files in both JSON and markdown formats for easy reference.
- **Historical Auditing:** Maintain a versioned history of schema changes, allowing developers to track evolution over time and compare previous states.
- **Configuration Options:** Allow configuration via environment variables or command-line flags (e.g., file path, file format, retention policy).
- **CLI Integration:** Introduce a `--merge-persist` flag in the CLI tool to trigger persistence operations, consolidating diff data after execution.

## Implementation
- **Single Source File:** Implement the persistence logic in a dedicated module (e.g., `src/lib/persistence.js`).
- **File Management:** Use Node's file system (fs) module for writing and reading persistence data, ensuring error handling and data integrity.
- **Integration Points:** Update the main CLI entry point to handle the `--merge-persist` flag by invoking the persistence module.
- **Testing:** Develop unit and integration tests to ensure diff outputs are correctly persisted and retrievable.

## Value Proposition
The PERSISTENCE feature enhances the overall tool by providing a reliable record of API schema evolutions. This improves traceability, eases debugging, and supports compliance by ensuring that historical changes are accurately logged and available for review.
