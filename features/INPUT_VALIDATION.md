# INPUT_VALIDATION

## Overview
This update enhances the robustness and usability of our CLI input validation by integrating colored output for errors and help messages using the popular `chalk` library. The objective is to make error messages more understandable and to visually differentiate critical information (errors in red, help text in accent colors), aligning with our mission of clear communication and autonomous intelligent automation.

## Implementation Details
1. **Integration of Chalk:**
   - Add `chalk` as a dependency in the `package.json` file. For example:
     ```json
     "dependencies": {
       ...,
       "chalk": "^5.1.0"
     }
     ```
   - Import chalk in `src/lib/main.js`:
     ```js
     import chalk from 'chalk';
     ```

2. **Enhanced Error Formatting:**
   - Update the `handleInvalidCommand` function in `src/lib/main.js` to output the error messages using `chalk.red` for errors and include additional colored accent text for suggestions (e.g., using chalk.blue or chalk.yellow for help prompts).
   - Example modification:
     ```js
     function handleInvalidCommand(args) {
       const input = args.join(" ");
       if (/^(NaN|-?\d+(\.\d+)?)$/.test(input)) {
         const errorMsg = chalk.red(`Error: '${input}' is not a recognized command. Use '--help' for available options. Please ensure you are providing a valid command. Use '--help' to view all available options.`);
         console.error(errorMsg);
       } else {
         const errorMsg = chalk.red(`Error: '${input}' is not a recognized command. Use '--help' for available options.`);
         console.error(errorMsg);
       }
     }
     ```

3. **Enhanced Help Message:**
   - Update the help message output (triggered by `--help`) to use colored headings and accents. For example, use `chalk.green` for titles and `chalk.blue` for usage instructions.

4. **Testing Adjustments:**
   - Update unit tests in `tests/unit/main.test.js` to either strip ANSI color codes from the actual output before comparing or to include the expected chalk color codes. This ensures that tests validate the functionality without being affected by color codes.
   - Example approach in tests:
     ```js
     // Use a regex to remove ANSI escape sequences before assertion
     const cleanOutput = output.replace(/\u001B\[[0-9;]*m/g, "");
     expect(cleanOutput).toEqual(expectedMessage);
     ```

5. **Documentation Updates:**
   - Update the README (README.md) to document the colored output behavior, specifying that errors are shown in red and help texts in accent colors. Include examples in the CLI options section.

## Long-Term Direction
This update not only standardizes input validation using robust schema checking with Zod but also significantly improves user experience through visual differentiation. As further enhancements, additional user feedback might be integrated into all CLI outputs (e.g., diagnostics and verbose logs) to ensure clarity and to support deeper self-improvement mechanisms. This change reinforces our commitment to making the automation process both technically robust and user-friendly.
