# INPUT_VALIDATION Feature

## Overview
This feature introduces robust input validation for the CLI tool. By leveraging the existing Zod dependency, the feature ensures that incoming command-line arguments are validated against a predefined schema. This increases reliability by preventing malformed or unexpected inputs, ensuring that users receive clear error messages and guidance. The validation occurs as soon as the tool starts, so that only recognized and properly formatted flags and arguments are processed.

## Implementation Details
1. **Schema Definition:**
   - Define a Zod schema for the allowed CLI arguments. For example, validate that flags like `--help`, `--version`, `--diagnostics`, etc. conform to expected boolean values or string patterns.
   - Incorporate checks for special cases, such as excluding non-standard inputs like 'NaN'.

2. **Integration Into Main.js:**
   - At the beginning of `src/lib/main.js`, import Zod and instantiate the validation schema.
   - Before processing any flags, validate `process.argv.slice(2)` using Zod. If validation fails, output a clear error message indicating the nature of the input error and a suggestion to use `--help` for guidance.
   - Ensure that valid inputs simply pass through to the existing command handlings without disrupting current functionalities.

3. **Error Handling:**
   - In case of invalid inputs, the tool should log a friendly error message and exit gracefully. This prevents unexpected behavior or cryptic errors during runtime.

## Testing
1. **Unit Tests Update:**
   - Update `tests/unit/main.test.js` with new test cases that feed malformed or non-compliant arguments to the CLI.
   - Verify that erroneous inputs (e.g., unexpected string values or arrays of flags) trigger the appropriate error messages.
   - Maintain tests for valid inputs to ensure that they are processed as before.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - Test boundary cases such as no arguments provided, or arguments with nested quotes, ensuring that the schema validation distinguishes valid and invalid cases appropriately.

## Documentation
1. **README Update:**
   - Add a new section documenting the input validation feature. Explain that the CLI now uses Zod to validate incoming arguments, list the supported flags, and detail the error messages for invalid inputs.
   - Provide usage examples to help users understand the acceptable format for CLI options.

## Long-Term Direction
The INPUT_VALIDATION feature lays the groundwork for further enhancement in user input handling. Future iterations might refine the schema to handle more complex command-line inputs, incorporate auto-correction suggestions, and extend validation to configuration files or environment variables. As the CLI scales, a robust validation layer will be critical for maintaining reliability and ensuring that users have a smooth experience.
