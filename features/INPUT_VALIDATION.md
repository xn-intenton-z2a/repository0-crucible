# INPUT_VALIDATION

## Overview
This feature introduces robust and standardized input validation for the CLI tool. Building on the existing use of Zod, this update refines the argument validation process by incorporating a dedicated error formatter, ensuring that users receive clear and consistent feedback on input errors. Additionally, it enforces stricter checks on the CLI arguments and provides suggestions for corrective action.

## Implementation Details
1. **Schema Definition and Enforcement:**
   - Define a comprehensive Zod schema for accepted CLI arguments (e.g., flags such as `--help`, `--version`, `--diagnostics`, etc.) in `src/lib/main.js`.
   - Validate the command-line arguments (`process.argv.slice(2)`) as soon as the CLI starts.
   - Include custom validations to prevent inputs like `NaN` or other malformed strings from passing through.

2. **Error Formatting:**
   - Integrate a new errorFormatter function in the source file that captures Zod validation errors.
   - When a validation error occurs, output a structured error message that clearly states the invalid inputs and offers guidance (e.g., "Use '--help' for available options").
   - Ensure that this output does not interrupt the logging of valid invocations or alter the expected display of help information.

3. **Integration into Main Process Flow:**
   - Place the validation logic at the very beginning of the `main` function in `src/lib/main.js`.
   - If the validation passes, allow the rest of the command processing to proceed as usual.
   - If validation fails, log the error using the standardized error formatter and exit gracefully.

4. **Dependency and File Updates:**
   - Since Zod is already a dependency, no changes are needed in the dependency file. Only enhancements to the usage and error handling in the source file and tests are required.

## Testing
1. **Unit Tests:**
   - Enhance the existing test suite in `tests/unit/main.test.js` to include scenarios where malformed inputs (like unexpected strings or special values such as `NaN`) are provided.
   - Verify that the CLI outputs the standardized error message for invalid inputs, and suggest using `--help` for valid options.
   - Ensure that valid inputs proceed normally, without interference from the new validation logic.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - Test cases with no arguments should still default to help display.
   - Include tests where multiple invalid flags are provided, and confirm that the error messaging aggregates the issues.

## Documentation
1. **README Update:**
   - Update the CLI Options section in the README to mention that inputs are now validated using Zod.
   - Document the standardized error output and provide examples of how invalid input messages will appear.
   - Clarify that the CLI now enforces strict validation rules to improve reliability and user guidance.

## Long-Term Direction
This update to INPUT_VALIDATION lays the groundwork for a more resilient command-line interface. Future iterations may include advanced auto-correction suggestions, dynamic schema updates based on context, and extended support for configuration file validations. By providing clear and structured error messaging, the tool ensures that users are accurately informed about the nature of their input errors and how to resolve them, thereby aligning with the mission of delivering dependable autonomous automation.
