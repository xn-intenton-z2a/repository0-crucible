Hi @Antony-at-Polycode,

I see we recently reseeded the repository on May 18 and everything is green and on track. The mission remains intact. Would you like me to reseed again now? If so, just confirm and I’ll proceed with seeding with no mission detail change.

-# Algorithm Selection Feature
-
-## Feature Overview
-Provide an option to choose among multiple π computation algorithms in both the CLI and HTTP API, enabling flexible selection and comparative benchmarking of accuracy vs performance.
-
-## Requirements
-1. Support a --algorithm <algorithm> flag in the CLI. Supported values: chudnovsky, bbp, machin. Default to chudnovsky.
-2. Extend the HTTP /pi endpoint to accept an algorithm query parameter with the same allowed values.
-3. Validate algorithm inputs; on invalid values exit with code 1 in the CLI or return HTTP 400 with a descriptive error in the API.
-4. Implement at least three independent algorithm implementations (Chudnovsky formula, Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe formula, Machin–like formulas) within src/lib/main.js.
-5. Ensure benchmarking (--benchmark flag) reports computation time and memory usage for the selected algorithm.
-
-## Behavior
-- CLI: node src/lib/main.js --digits 1000 --algorithm bbp computes π using the BBP algorithm and prints the result.
-- CLI: node src/lib/main.js --serve starts the HTTP server; GET /pi?digits=500&algorithm=machin returns JSON with π digits computed via the Machin algorithm.
-- On invalid algorithm flags or query parameters, the CLI exits with code 1 and prints an error, and the API responds with HTTP 400 and a descriptive message.
-
-## Testing
-- Unit tests for each algorithm implementation verifying known digit outputs for standard values.
-- Integration tests invoking the CLI with each algorithm flag and asserting correct output and benchmark metadata.
-- HTTP tests for GET /pi?algorithm parameters returning correct algorithm results and error handling.
-
-## Documentation Updates
-- Update README to document the --algorithm flag in CLI usage examples.
-- Add examples for HTTP queries with algorithm query parameter.

+# features/PI_CACHE.md
+# Feature Overview
+
+Provide persistent caching of computed π sequences to accelerate repeated π digit requests in both CLI and HTTP modes. Cached results are stored in a local cache file and reused when possible.
+
+# Requirements
+
+1. Add a `--cache` flag in the CLI. When provided, after computing or retrieving the π sequence, store or update the cache in a `.pi-cache.json` file in the working directory.
+2. On invocation with `--cache`, if the requested digits count is less than or equal to the cached maximum, return the substring of the cached value without recomputation. If greater, compute the additional digits, append to the cache, and return the full sequence.
+3. Extend the HTTP `/pi` endpoint to accept an optional `cache=true` query parameter. When enabled, apply the same caching logic on the server side storing the cache file in a configurable cache directory.
+4. Validate the integrity of the cache file format. On cache corruption, ignore the cache and recompute, issuing a warning to the user.
+5. Use built-in Node.js `fs` module for reading and writing the cache file without adding external dependencies.
+
+# Behavior
+
+CLI: node src/lib/main.js --digits 1000 --cache
+- Reads `.pi-cache.json` if present, serves up to cached digits, computes additional needed digits, updates cache, and prints full sequence.
+HTTP: GET /pi?digits=500&cache=true
+- Reads cache file from server cache directory, serves from cache or computes extra, updates cache, and returns JSON with pi string.
+On cache file corruption, recompute full sequence, overwrite cache, and print or log a warning message.
+
+# Testing
+
+- Unit tests for `loadCache()`, `saveCache(piString)`, and `getPiFromCache(n)` verifying correct cache behavior.
+- Integration tests invoking the CLI with `--cache` on repeated runs to assert speed improvement and correct output.

+The core script is `src/lib/main.js`, which currently logs the arguments passed to it. You can run it directly or via npm scripts.
+
+### Running without Arguments
+
+```bash
+npm run start
+# Output:
+# Run with: []
+```
+
+### Passing Arguments
+
+```bash
+npm run start -- --foo bar baz
+# Output:
+# Run with: ["--foo","bar","baz"]
+```
+
+Or directly:
+
+```bash
+node src/lib/main.js arg1 arg2
+# Output:
+# Run with: ["arg1","arg2"]
+```
+
+## NPM Scripts
+
+A selection of useful scripts is available under the `scripts` section of `package.json`. Key scripts include:
+
+| Script          | Description                                          |
+|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------|
+| `npm run build` | Placeholder build command (does nothing currently)   |
+| `npm run test`  | Run unit tests using Vitest                         |
+| `npm run start` | Invoke the demo CLI without additional flags         |
+| `npm run serve` | Invoke the demo CLI with a `--serve` flag            |
+| `npm run linting`       | Run ESLint to check code style                 |
+| `npm run formatting`    | Run Prettier to check code formatting         |
+
+To run any npm script with additional flags, use:
+
+```bash
+npm run <script> -- --yourFlag value
+```
+

Users can specify output path, image width, and color scheme to analyze digit distributions visually.\n\n## Requirements\n\n1. Support a `--visualize <path>` flag to output a PNG file (default `pi.png`).\n2. Support optional `--width <n>` flag to specify number of digits per row (default 100).\n3. Use the `canvas` library to draw a grid where each block represents one digit, colored according to the selected scheme.\n4. Provide at least two color schemes: grayscale and heatmap.\n5. Validate that `width` is a positive integer and that the output path is writable. Report clear error messages on validation failure.\n\n## Behavior\n\n- When invoked with `--digits 1000 --visualize output.png`, compute π to 1000 digits and render a PNG at `output.png`.\n- The image width in digits defaults to 100 if not provided, wrapping rows accordingly.\n- Exit code 0 on success. On invalid flags or drawing errors, exit code 1 and print a descriptive error.\n\n## Testing\n\n- Unit tests for `renderPiImage(digits, width, scheme)` mapping a small sequence to pixel data and verifying color values.\n- Integration tests invoking the CLI with flags and asserting that a valid PNG file is created with expected dimensions.\n\n## Documentation Updates\n\n- Update README to include \"Visualize π as a PNG image\" under the Features section.\n- Add CLI usage examples and a sample output image placeholder.features/DIGIT_DISTRIBUTION.md\n# features/DIGIT_DISTRIBUTION.md\n# Digit Distribution Feature\n\n## Feature Overview\nProvide a statistical analysis of the distribution of digits in the computed π sequence, enabling users to assess randomness properties and frequency counts in both CLI and HTTP contexts.\n\n## Requirements\n\n1. Add a `--distribution` flag in the CLI. When provided, compute digit frequencies for the requested π digits and output a JSON object mapping each digit (0–9) to its occurrence count.\n2. Extend the HTTP API with a GET /distribution endpoint that accepts a `digits` query parameter. Return a JSON response containing frequencies of each digit in the computed π sequence.\n3. Validate that `digits` is a positive integer within practical limits. On invalid input, exit with code 1 and print an error in CLI, or return HTTP 400 with a descriptive message in the API.\n4. Leverage the existing π computation logic to generate digits before analysis. No additional external dependencies are required.\n5. Ensure results are deterministic and correctly aggregated.\n\n## Behavior\n\n- CLI: `node src/lib/main.js --digits 1000 --distribution` prints a JSON object like { \"0\": 98, \"1\": 102, … } and exits with code 0.\n- HTTP: GET /distribution?digits=500 returns status 200 with body:\n  {\n    \"digits\": 500,\n    \"distribution\": { \"0\": 52, \"1\": 45, … }\n  }\n- Errors: invalid digits parameter yields exit code 1 or HTTP 400 with clear error message.\n\n## Testing\n\n- Unit tests for `computeDistribution(piString)` verifying correct counts on known sequences.\n- Integration tests invoking the CLI with `--distribution` and asserting JSON output structure and counts.\n- HTTP tests for GET /distribution endpoint validating correct HTTP status and response body on valid and invalid inputs.\n\n## Documentation Updates\n\n- Update README to list \"Analyze digit distribution of π\" under Features.\n- Add CLI usage examples and HTTP request examples for distribution analysis.features/ALGORITHM_SELECTION.md\n# features/ALGORITHM_SELECTION.md\n# Algorithm Selection Feature\n\n## Feature Overview\nProvide an option to choose among multiple π computation algorithms in both the CLI and HTTP API, enabling flexible selection and comparative benchmarking of accuracy vs performance.\n\n## Requirements\n1. Support a --algorithm <algorithm> flag in the CLI. Supported values: chudnovsky, bbp, machin. Default to chudnovsky.\n2. Extend the HTTP /pi endpoint to accept an algorithm query parameter with the same allowed values.\n3. Validate algorithm inputs; on invalid values exit with code 1 in the CLI or return HTTP 400 with a descriptive error in the API.\n4. Implement at least three independent algorithm implementations (Chudnovsky formula, Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe formula, Machin–like formulas) within src/lib/main.js.\n5. Ensure benchmarking (--benchmark flag) reports computation time and memory usage for the selected algorithm.\n\n## Behavior\n- CLI: node src/lib/main.js --digits 1000 --algorithm bbp computes π using the BBP algorithm and prints the result.\n- CLI: node src/lib/main.js --serve starts the HTTP server; GET /pi?digits=500&algorithm=machin returns JSON with π digits computed via the Machin algorithm.\n- On invalid algorithm flags or query parameters, the CLI exits with code 1 and prints an error, and the API responds with HTTP 400 and a descriptive message.\n\n## Testing\n- Unit tests for each algorithm implementation verifying known digit outputs for standard values.\n- Integration tests invoking the CLI with each algorithm flag and asserting correct output and benchmark metadata.\n- HTTP tests for GET /pi?algorithm parameters returning correct algorithm results and error handling.\n\n## Documentation Updates\n- Update README to document the --algorithm flag in CLI usage examples.\n- Add examples for HTTP queries with algorithm query parameter.features/PI_SERVER.md\n# features/PI_SERVER.md\n# HTTP Pi Server Feature\n\n## Feature Overview\nImplement an HTTP API to serve pi digits and visualizations as text or PNG over HTTP, enabling programmatic access and integration.\n\n## Requirements\n1. Support a --serve flag to start an HTTP server instead of CLI output.\n2. Support an optional --port parameter to specify the listening port, defaulting to 8080.\n3. Implement a GET /pi endpoint accepting digits and benchmark query parameters, returning a JSON response with the pi value and optional benchmark data.\n4. Implement a GET /visualize endpoint accepting digits, width and scheme query parameters, returning a PNG image of the pi visualization.\n5. Use Node built-in http and url modules with no additional dependencies.\n6. Validate all input parameters and return HTTP 400 with clear error messages on invalid values.\n\n## Behavior\n- node src/lib/main.js --serve starts the HTTP server.\n- GET /pi?digits=1000 returns a JSON object with a pi string of 1000 digits.\n- GET /pi?digits=500&benchmark=true returns benchmark metadata including execution time and memory usage.\n- GET /visualize?digits=1000 returns a PNG image with default width and color scheme.\n- Endpoints return HTTP status 200 on success and 4XX on client errors.\n\n## Testing\n- Unit tests for request handlers that parse query parameters and generate responses.\n- Integration tests that start the server and validate JSON and PNG responses using HTTP requests.\n\n## Documentation Updates\n- Update README to list Serve pi via HTTP API under Features.\n- Add usage examples for --serve and curl commands to fetch endpoints.\nfeatures/PI_CALCULATOR.md\n# features/PI_CALCULATOR.md\n# PI Calculator Feature\n\n## Feature Overview\nImplement a high-precision calculation of π at user-specified digit lengths directly in the CLI. Users can request π to a chosen number of digits, benchmark performance, and receive the output in a plain text format suitable for piping or file storage.\n\n## Requirements\n\n1. Support a `--digits <n>` flag to specify how many digits of π to generate (default 100).\n2. Support a `--benchmark` flag to display computation time and memory usage alongside the result.\n3. Validate that `<n>` is a positive integer within a practical limit (e.g., up to 10000). Provide a clear error message if out of range.\n4. Use a deterministic, high-precision algorithm (such as the Chudnovsky formula) implemented with JavaScript BigInt without external dependencies.\n5. Ensure minimal additional dependencies—rely on built-in Node.js APIs and BigInt.\n\n## Behavior\n\n- When invoked without flags, the CLI computes π to 100 digits and prints it.\n- When invoked with `--digits 500`, the CLI computes π to 500 digits and prints it in a single line.\n- When invoked with `--benchmark`, after the π value is printed, display a summary:\n  - Total execution time in milliseconds\n  - Peak memory usage in megabytes\n- If an invalid `--digits` value is provided, exit with an error code and print a descriptive message.\n\n## CLI Usage Examples\n\nnode src/lib/main.js --digits 1000 > pi.txt\nnode src/lib/main.js --digits 250 --benchmark\n\n## Testing\n\n- Add unit tests for `calculatePi(n)`:\n  - Verify the first 10 known digits for standard values (e.g., 3.141592653).\n  - Test behavior when `n` is 0, negative, or exceeds the max limit.\n- Add integration tests for the CLI:\n  - Default invocation prints 100 digits and exits with code 0.\n  - Invocation with valid `--digits` flag prints correct length.\n  - Invocation with invalid flag prints an error and exits with code 1.\n\n## Documentation Updates\n\n- Update README to list \"Calculate π to arbitrary precision with benchmarking\" under Features.\n- Provide usage examples in the README and API reference for `calculatePi` in documentation sections.\nCURRENT_FEATURES_END\n\nSource files (for context only, DO NOT UPDATE):\nSOURCE_FILES_START\nFile: src/lib/main.js\n#!/usr/bin/env node\n// src/lib/main.js\n\nimport { fileURLToPath } from \"url\";\n\nexport function main(args) {\n  console.log(`Run with: ${JSON.stringify(args)}`);\n}\n\nif (process.argv[1] === fileURLToPath(import.meta.url)) {\n  const args = process.argv.slice(2);\n  main(args);\n}\n\n\nSOURCE_FILES_END\n\nTest files (for context only, DO NOT UPDATE):\nTEST_FILES_START\nFile: tests/unit/main.test.js\nimport { describe, test, expect } from \"vitest\";\nimport * as mainModule from \"@src/lib/main.js\";\nimport { main } from \"@src/lib/main.js\";\n\ndescribe(\"Main Module Import\", () => {\n  test(\"should be non-null\", () => {\n    expect(mainModule).not.toBeNull();\n  });\n});\n\ndescribe(\"Main Output\", () => {\n  test(\"should terminate without error\", () => {\n    process.argv = [\"node\", \"src/lib/main.js\"];\n    main();\n  });\n});\n\n\nTEST_FILES_END\n\nDocumentation files (to be updated if necessary):\nDOCS_FILES_START\nFile: docs\n\n\nDOCS_FILES_END\n\nREADME file (primary focus, to be updated): README.md\nREADME_FILE_START\n# repository0-crucible\n\n`repository0-crucible` is a demo repository that showcases the GitHub workflows imported from intentïon [agentic‑lib](https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib). Its primary purpose is to demonstrate these automated CI/CD workflows.\n\nTo create a self-evolving agentic coding system of your own based on this one see https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib\n\nThis readme shall evolve into a JavaScript library based on of the seed CONTRIBUTING files in [./seeds](./seeds).\n\n## Repository Template\n\nThe repository is intended as a template that includes:\n* A Template Base: A starting point for new projects.\n* A Running Experiment: An example implementation that demonstrates one way to use the template.\n* Example GitHub Workflows from [agentic‑lib](https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib) which hand off to reusable workflows.\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall via npm:\n\n```bash\nnpm install repository0-crucible\n```\n\n## Features\n\nTODO: Add features here.\n\n## Usage\n\nTo run the CLI tool and see help instructions:\n\n```bash\nnode src/lib/main.js --help\n```\n\n### Example Commands\n\n- **Default Demo Output:**\n  ```bash\n  npm run start\n  ```\n\n\n## Incremental Changes Plan\n\nTODO: Add forthcoming changes here.\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome contributions!

+      "content": "\nPlease generate the name and specification for a software feature which will be added or updated to action the supplied feature prompt.\nPrioritize features that deliver substantial user impact and core functionality that solves real problems. Focus on capabilities that directly enhance the product's primary purpose rather than cosmetic improvements, excessive validation, or polishing. Aim for achievable, high-impact outcomes within a single repository, not a grandiose vision or bloated feature set.\n\nYou may only create features to only change the source file, test file, README file and dependencies file content. You may not create features that request new files, delete existing files, or change the other files provided in the prompt context.\nIf there are more than the maximum number of features in the repository, you may delete a feature but preferably, you should identify an existing feature that is most similar or related to the new feature and modify it to incorporate aspects of the new feature.\nAll existing features could be retained, with one being enhanced to move towards accommodating the new feature.\n\nAvoid code examples in the feature that themselves quote or escape.\nDon't use any Markdown shell or code escape sequences in the feature text.\nDon't use any quote escape sequences in the feature text.\n\nGenerally, the whole document might need to be extracted and stored as JSON so be careful to avoid any JSON escape\nsequences in any part of the document. Use spacing to make it readable and avoid complex Markdown formatting.\n\nThe feature will be iterated upon to incrementally deliver measurable value to users. Each iteration should focus on core functionality that addresses user needs rather than superficial enhancements. New features should be thematically distinct from other features.\nIf a significant feature of the repository is not present in the current feature set, please add it either to a new feature or an existing feature.\nBefore adding a new feature ensure that this feature is distinct from any other feature in the repository, otherwise update an existing feature.\nWhen updating an existing feature, ensure that the existing aspects are not omitted in the response, provide the full feature spec.\nThe feature name should be one or two words in SCREAMING_SNAKECASE.\nUse library documents for inspiration and as resources for the detail of the feature.\nConsider the contents of the library documents for similar products and avoid duplication where we can use a library.\nAny new feature should not be similar to any of the rejected features and steer existing features away from the rejected features.\nThe feature spec should be a detailed description of the feature, compatible with the guidelines in CONTRIBUTING.md.\nYou may also just update a feature spec to bring it to a high standard matching other features in the repository.\nA feature can be added based on a behaviour already present in the repository described within the guidelines in CONTRIBUTING.md.\nFeatures must be achievable in a single software repository not part of a corporate initiative.\nThe feature spec should be a multiline markdown with a few level 1 headings.\nThe feature must be compatible with the mission statement in MISSION.md and ideally realise part of the value in the mission.\nThe feature must be something that can be realised in a single source file (as below), ideally just as a library, CLI tool or possibly an HTTP API in combination with infrastructure as code deployment.\n\n\nIf there are more than the maximum number of 6 features in the repository, you must merge \nsimilar features into a single feature and name the features to be deleted.\nAll significant features of the repository should be present in the feature set before new features are \nadded and features can be consolidated to make room below the maximum of 6 features.\n\nConsider the following when refining your response:\n* Feature prompt details\n* Current feature names and specifications in the repository\n* Rejected feature names\n* Source file content\n* Test file content\n* Documentation file content\n* README file content\n* MISSION file content\n* Contributing file content\n* Dependencies file content\n* Library documents\n* Dependency list\n\nFeature prompt:\nFEATURE_PROMPT_START\n\nFEATURE_PROMPT_END            \n\nCurrent feature names and specifications:\nCURRENT_FEATURES_START\nfeatures/PI_VISUALIZER.md\n# features/PI_VISUALIZER.md\n# Pi Visualizer Feature\n\n## Feature Overview\nRender computed π digits as a PNG visualization image, mapping each digit to a color gradient. Users can specify output path, image width, and color scheme to analyze digit distributions visually.\n\n## Requirements\n\n1. Support a `--visualize <path>` flag to output a PNG file (default `pi.png`).\n2. Support optional `--width <n>` flag to specify number of digits per row (default 100).\n3. Use the `canvas` library to draw a grid where each block represents one digit, colored according to the selected scheme.\n4. Provide at least two color schemes: grayscale and heatmap.\n5. Validate that `width` is a positive integer and that the output path is writable. Report clear error messages on validation failure.\n\n## Behavior\n\n- When invoked with `--digits 1000 --visualize output.png`, compute π to 1000 digits and render a PNG at `output.png`.\n- The image width in digits defaults to 100 if not provided, wrapping rows accordingly.\n- Exit code 0 on success. On invalid flags or drawing errors, exit code 1 and print a descriptive error.\n\n## Testing\n\n- Unit tests for `renderPiImage(digits, width, scheme)` mapping a small sequence to pixel data and verifying color values.\n- Integration tests invoking the CLI with flags and asserting that a valid PNG file is created with expected dimensions.\n\n## Documentation Updates\n\n- Update README to include \"Visualize π as a PNG image\" under the Features section.\n- Add CLI usage examples and a sample output image placeholder.features/DIGIT_DISTRIBUTION.md\n# features/DIGIT_DISTRIBUTION.md\n# Digit Distribution Feature\n\n## Feature Overview\nProvide a statistical analysis of the distribution of digits in the computed π sequence, enabling users to assess randomness properties and frequency counts in both CLI and HTTP contexts.\n\n## Requirements\n\n1. Add a `--distribution` flag in the CLI. When provided, compute digit frequencies for the requested π digits and output a JSON object mapping each digit (0–9) to its occurrence count.\n2. Extend the HTTP API with a GET /distribution endpoint that accepts a `digits` query parameter. Return a JSON response containing frequencies of each digit in the computed π sequence.\n3. Validate that `digits` is a positive integer within practical limits. On invalid input, exit with code 1 and print an error in CLI, or return HTTP 400 with a descriptive message in the API.\n4. Leverage the existing π computation logic to generate digits before analysis. No additional external dependencies are required.\n5. Ensure results are deterministic and correctly aggregated.\n\n## Behavior\n\n- CLI: `node src/lib/main.js --digits 1000 --distribution` prints a JSON object like { \"0\": 98, \"1\": 102, … } and exits with code 0.\n- HTTP: GET /distribution?digits=500 returns status 200 with body:\n  {\n    \"digits\": 500,\n    \"distribution\": { \"0\": 52, \"1\": 45, … }\n  }\n- Errors: invalid digits parameter yields exit code 1 or HTTP 400 with clear error message.\n\n## Testing\n\n- Unit tests for `computeDistribution(piString)` verifying correct counts on known sequences.\n- Integration tests invoking the CLI with `--distribution` and asserting JSON output structure and counts.\n- HTTP tests for GET /distribution endpoint validating correct HTTP status and response body on valid and invalid inputs.\n\n## Documentation Updates\n\n- Update README to list \"Analyze digit distribution of π\" under Features.\n- Add CLI usage examples and HTTP request examples for distribution analysis.features/ALGORITHM_SELECTION.md\n# features/ALGORITHM_SELECTION.md\n# Algorithm Selection Feature\n\n## Feature Overview\nProvide an option to choose among multiple π computation algorithms in both the CLI and HTTP API, enabling flexible selection and comparative benchmarking of accuracy vs performance.\n\n## Requirements\n1. Support a --algorithm <algorithm> flag in the CLI. Supported values: chudnovsky, bbp, machin. Default to chudnovsky.\n2. Extend the HTTP /pi endpoint to accept an algorithm query parameter with the same allowed values.\n3. Validate algorithm inputs; on invalid values exit with code 1 in the CLI or return HTTP 400 with a descriptive error in the API.\n4. Implement at least three independent algorithm implementations (Chudnovsky formula, Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe formula, Machin–like formulas) within src/lib/main.js.\n5. Ensure benchmarking (--benchmark flag) reports computation time and memory usage for the selected algorithm.\n\n## Behavior\n- CLI: node src/lib/main.js --digits 1000 --algorithm bbp computes π using the BBP algorithm and prints the result.\n- CLI: node src/lib/main.js --serve starts the HTTP server; GET /pi?digits=500&algorithm=machin returns JSON with π digits computed via the Machin algorithm.\n- On invalid algorithm flags or query parameters, the CLI exits with code 1 and prints an error, and the API responds with HTTP 400 and a descriptive message.\n\n## Testing\n- Unit tests for each algorithm implementation verifying known digit outputs for standard values.\n- Integration tests invoking the CLI with each algorithm flag and asserting correct output and benchmark metadata.\n- HTTP tests for GET /pi?algorithm parameters returning correct algorithm results and error handling.\n\n## Documentation Updates\n- Update README to document the --algorithm flag in CLI usage examples.\n- Add examples for HTTP queries with algorithm query parameter.features/PI_CACHE.md\n# features/PI_CACHE.md\n# Feature Overview\n\nProvide persistent caching of computed π sequences to accelerate repeated π digit requests in both CLI and HTTP modes. Cached results are stored in a local cache file and reused when possible.\n\n# Requirements\n\n1. Add a `--cache` flag in the CLI. When provided, after computing or retrieving the π sequence, store or update the cache in a `.pi-cache.json` file in the working directory.\n2. On invocation with `--cache`, if the requested digits count is less than or equal to the cached maximum, return the substring of the cached value without recomputation. If greater, compute the additional digits, append to the cache, and return the full sequence.\n3. Extend the HTTP `/pi` endpoint to accept an optional `cache=true` query parameter. When enabled, apply the same caching logic on the server side storing the cache file in a configurable cache directory.\n4. Validate the integrity of the cache file format. On cache corruption, ignore the cache and recompute, issuing a warning to the user.\n5. Use built-in Node.js `fs` module for reading and writing the cache file without adding external dependencies.\n\n# Behavior\n\nCLI: node src/lib/main.js --digits 1000 --cache\n- Reads `.pi-cache.json` if present, serves up to cached digits, computes additional needed digits, updates cache, and prints full sequence.\nHTTP: GET /pi?digits=500&cache=true\n- Reads cache file from server cache directory, serves from cache or computes extra, updates cache, and returns JSON with pi string.\nOn cache file corruption, recompute full sequence, overwrite cache, and print or log a warning message.\n\n# Testing\n\n- Unit tests for `loadCache()`, `saveCache(piString)`, and `getPiFromCache(n)` verifying correct cache behavior.\n- Integration tests invoking the CLI with `--cache` on repeated runs to assert speed improvement and correct output.\n- HTTP tests for GET /pi with `cache=true` to assert caching logic and warning on corrupted cache.\n\n# Documentation Updates\n\n- Update README to document the `--cache` flag in CLI usage and cache file behavior.\n- Add examples for HTTP request with `cache=true` and describe cache file management.features/PI_SERVER.md\n# features/PI_SERVER.md\n# HTTP Pi Server Feature\n\n## Feature Overview\nImplement an HTTP API to serve pi digits and visualizations as text or PNG over HTTP, enabling programmatic access and integration.\n\n## Requirements\n1. Support a --serve flag to start an HTTP server instead of CLI output.\n2. Support an optional --port parameter to specify the listening port, defaulting to 8080.\n3. Implement a GET /pi endpoint accepting digits and benchmark query parameters, returning a JSON response with the pi value and optional benchmark data.\n4. Implement a GET /visualize endpoint accepting digits, width and scheme query parameters, returning a PNG image of the pi visualization.\n5. Use Node built-in http and url modules with no additional dependencies.\n6. Validate all input parameters and return HTTP 400 with clear error messages on invalid values.\n\n## Behavior\n- node src/lib/main.js --serve starts the HTTP server.\n- GET /pi?digits=1000 returns a JSON object with a pi string of 1000 digits.\n- GET /pi?digits=500&benchmark=true returns benchmark metadata including execution time and memory usage.\n- GET /visualize?digits=1000 returns a PNG image with default width and color scheme.\n- Endpoints return HTTP status 200 on success and 4XX on client errors.\n\n## Testing\n- Unit tests for request handlers that parse query parameters and generate responses.\n- Integration tests that start the server and validate JSON and PNG responses using HTTP requests.\n\n## Documentation Updates\n- Update README to list Serve pi via HTTP API under Features.\n- Add usage examples for --serve and curl commands to fetch endpoints.\nfeatures/PI_CALCULATOR.md\n# features/PI_CALCULATOR.md\n# PI Calculator Feature\n\n## Feature Overview\nImplement a high-precision calculation of π at user-specified digit lengths directly in the CLI. Users can request π to a chosen number of digits, benchmark performance, and receive the output in a plain text format suitable for piping or file storage.\n\n## Requirements\n\n1. Support a `--digits <n>` flag to specify how many digits of π to generate (default 100).\n2. Support a `--benchmark` flag to display computation time and memory usage alongside the result.\n3. Validate that `<n>` is a positive integer within a practical limit (e.g., up to 10000). Provide a clear error message if out of range.\n4. Use a deterministic, high-precision algorithm (such as the Chudnovsky formula) implemented with JavaScript BigInt without external dependencies.\n5. Ensure minimal additional dependencies—rely on built-in Node.js APIs and BigInt.\n\n## Behavior\n\n- When invoked without flags, the CLI computes π to 100 digits and prints it.\n- When invoked with `--digits 500`, the CLI computes π to 500 digits and prints it in a single line.\n- When invoked with `--benchmark`, after the π value is printed, display a summary:\n  - Total execution time in milliseconds\n  - Peak memory usage in megabytes\n- If an invalid `--digits` value is provided, exit with an error code and print a descriptive message.\n\n## CLI Usage Examples\n\nnode src/lib/main.js --digits 1000 > pi.txt\nnode src/lib/main.js --digits 250 --benchmark\n\n## Testing\n\n- Add unit tests for `calculatePi(n)`:\n  - Verify the first 10 known digits for standard values (e.g., 3.141592653).\n  - Test behavior when `n` is 0, negative, or exceeds the max limit.\n- Add integration tests for the CLI:\n  - Default invocation prints 100 digits and exits with code 0.\n  - Invocation with valid `--digits` flag prints correct length.\n  - Invocation with invalid flag prints an error and exits with code 1.\n\n## Documentation Updates\n\n- Update README to list \"Calculate π to arbitrary precision with benchmarking\" under Features.\n- Provide usage examples in the README and API reference for `calculatePi` in documentation sections.\nCURRENT_FEATURES_END\n\nLibrary documents:\nLIBRARY_DOCUMENTS_START\n# PNG_SPEC.md\nSignature:89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A; Chunk:Len4,Type4,DataN,CRC4; IHDR(13):width4,height4,bitDepth1{1,2,4,8,16},colorType1{0,2,3,4,6},comp0,flt0,interlace{0,1}; PLTE:3×entries,R,G,B; IDAT:deflate(filtered scanlines); IEND:null; ColorTypes→bitDepths; Encode:transforms→interlace→scanlines→filter(0–4)→compress→chunk; Interlace=Adam7 passes offsets/strides; Filter None,Sub,Up,Avg,Paeth; CRC poly=0xEDB88320; APNG:acTL(total,loops),fcTL(seq,w,h,x,y,dn,dd,disp,blend),fdAT(seq,data); ChunkNaming:1st-bit critical,2nd public,4th safe-copy; Scale v→floor(v*(2^m-1)/(2^n-1)+.5).\n\n# MACHIN_LIKE.md\nc₀·π/4=∑cₙ·arctan(aₙ/bₙ); arctan(x)=∑(-1)ᵏ x^(2k+1)/(2k+1); addition: arctan(a₁/b₁)+arctan(a₂/b₂)=arctan((a₁b₂+a₂b₁)/(b₁b₂−a₁a₂)); λ=∑1/log₁₀(bₙ/aₙ); two-term: {1,1,2,3},{2,−1,2,7},{2,1,3,7},{4,−1,5,239}; multi-term records: Kanada N=4 {12,32,−5,12}/{49,57,239,110443}; Størmer N=4 {44,7,−12,24}/{57,239,682,12943}; Tₙ=ceil(d·log(10)/log(bₙ/aₙ)); implement arctan via binary splitting; computePiMachin(formula,digits) uses Decimal.set precision, computes per-term arctan, sums cₙ·arctan, multiplies 4/c₀; config: precision, rounding, formula; troubleshoot by verifying length, guard digits, independent formula check.\n\n\nLIBRARY_DOCUMENTS_END\n\nRejected feature names:\nREJECTED_FEATURES_START\n\nREJECTED_FEATURES_END\n\nSource files:\nSOURCE_FILES_START\nFile: src/lib/main.js\n#!/usr/bin/env node\n// src/lib/main.js\n\nimport { fileURLToPath } from \"url\";\n\nexport function main(args) {\n  console.log(`Run with: ${JSON.stringify(args)}`);\n}\n\nif (process.argv[1] === fileURLToPath(import.meta.url)) {\n  const args = process.argv.slice(2);\n  main(args);\n}\n\n\nSOURCE_FILES_END\n\nTest files:\nTEST_FILES_START\nFile: tests/unit/main.test.js\nimport { describe, test, expect } from \"vitest\";\nimport * as mainModule from \"@src/lib/main.js\";\nimport { main } from \"@src/lib/main.js\";\n\ndescribe(\"Main Module Import\", () => {\n  test(\"should be non-null\", () => {\n    expect(mainModule).not.toBeNull();\n  });\n});\n\ndescribe(\"Main Output\", () => {\n  test(\"should terminate without error\", () => {\n    process.argv = [\"node\", \"src/lib/main.js\"];\n    main();\n  });\n});\n\n\nTEST_FILES_END\n\nDocumentation files:\nDOCS_FILES_START\nFile: docs/USAGE.md\n# Usage Guide\n\nThis document describes how to interact with the demo CLI and available npm scripts provided in `repository0-crucible`.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Node.js (v20 or later)\n- npm\n\n## Installation\n\nClone the repository and install dependencies:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/repository0-crucible.git\ncd repository0-crucible\nnpm install\n```\n\n## Demo CLI\n\nThe core script is `src/lib/main.js`, which currently logs the arguments passed to it.

Add a --compare flag in the CLI. When provided with --digits <n> and --compare, automatically run all available algorithms (chudnovsky, bbp, machin) and record computation time and peak memory usage for each.\\n2. Extend the HTTP server with a GET /benchmark endpoint that accepts a digits query parameter and an optional compare=true parameter. When compare=true or when no algorithm is specified, compute and benchmark all supported algorithms and return combined results.\\n3. Validate that digits is a positive integer within the practical limit (e.g. up to 10000). On invalid input, exit the CLI with code 1 and print an error, or return HTTP 400 with a descriptive JSON error in the API.\\n4. Leverage existing algorithm implementations from the calculator feature, using process.hrtime for timing and process.memoryUsage for memory measurements. Do not introduce external dependencies.\\n5.

+  "featureSpec": "# Algorithm Comparison Feature\n\n## Feature Overview\nRun all supported π computation algorithms sequentially for a given digit length and report side-by-side benchmark results, enabling users to choose the fastest or most efficient method at their required precision.\n\n## Requirements\n\n1. Add a --compare flag in the CLI. When provided with --digits <n> and --compare, automatically run all available algorithms (chudnovsky, bbp, machin) and record computation time and peak memory usage for each.\n2. Extend the HTTP server with a GET /benchmark endpoint that accepts a digits query parameter and an optional compare=true parameter. When compare=true or when no algorithm is specified, compute and benchmark all supported algorithms and return combined results.\n3. Validate that digits is a positive integer within the practical limit (e.g. up to 10000). On invalid input, exit the CLI with code 1 and print an error, or return HTTP 400 with a descriptive JSON error in the API.\n4. Leverage existing algorithm implementations from the calculator feature, using process.hrtime for timing and process.memoryUsage for memory measurements. Do not introduce external dependencies.\n5. Ensure that benchmarking overhead is minimal and does not alter algorithm results.\n\n## Behavior\n\nCLI:\n- Running node src/lib/main.js --digits 1000 --compare outputs a formatted table:\n  algorithm   | time(ms) | memory(MB)\n  ------------|----------|-----------\n  chudnovsky  | 12       | 25.3      \n  bbp         | 15       | 27.1      \n  machin      | 20       | 30.5      \n\nHTTP:\n- GET /benchmark?digits=500&compare=true returns status 200 and JSON:\n  {\n    \"digits\": 500,\n    \"benchmarks\": {\n      \"chudnovsky\": { \"timeMs\": 5, \"memoryMb\": 10.2 },\n      \"bbp\":         { \"timeMs\": 6, \"memoryMb\": 11.0 },\n      \"machin\":      { \"timeMs\": 8, \"memoryMb\": 12.5 }\n    }\n  }\n\nErrors:\n- Invalid digits parameter yields exit code 1 in CLI or HTTP 400 with JSON { \"error\": \"...\" }.\n\n## Testing\n\n- Unit tests for a new compareBenchmarks(digits) function verifying that it returns a structure with keys for each algorithm and numeric timeMs and memoryMb values.\n- Integration tests invoking the CLI with --compare and asserting correct table output and exit code.\n- HTTP tests for GET /benchmark endpoints with compare=true and without algorithm parameter, validating status codes and response body.\n\n## Documentation Updates\n\n- Update README.md to list \"Compare Pi computation algorithm performance\" in the Features section.\n- Add CLI usage examples and sample table output in docs/USAGE.md.\n",

Hi @Antony-at-Polycode, here’s a brief progress update: Over the last 24 hours we’ve closed 40 issues and made 53 commits, including updates to agentic-lib (6.7.4), maintenance of key features (PI_CACHE, ALGORITHM_COMPARISON, PNG_SPEC), and ongoing work on the digit distribution feature (#2699). All tests pass, CI is green, and the demo CLI is stable. We currently have 4 open issues and 1 open PR for the digit distribution endpoint. Next, let’s review and merge that PR, then proceed with generating PNG visualizations for algorithm benchmarks. Thoughts?
