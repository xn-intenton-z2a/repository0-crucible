**owl-builder** is a JavaScript library and CLI tool designed to:
- Hold constants for the URLs of free open public data sources.
- Crawl these open public data sources via APIs or web crawling to capture data as JSON files.
- Transform JSON files and capture data into OWL ontologies.
- Read and write and OWL ontologies as JSON files.
- Provide examples tools for querying OWL ontologies stored as JSON via a CLI with an ESJ like syntax.
- Include CLI variations on this example: node src/lib/main.js --capital-cities (yielding OWL as JSON file showing capital cities).
- Showcase all the features of the library in the README.md file.

owl-builder is a CLI tool which will facilitate the creation of OWL ontologies from public data sources,
and to provide a set of tools for managing the OWL ontologies in a JSON format.

Activity:

Maintained feature LIST_SOURCES with

Feature spec:

# Summary
Add a new CLI flag list-sources to expose the list of public data source URLs supported by the library. This enables users to discover and select available sources without inspecting code.

# Functional Requirements
- Define a constant supportedDataSources as an array of URL strings in src/lib/main.js
- Export a function getSupportedDataSources that returns the supportedDataSources array
- When the CLI is invoked with the flag --list-sources, log the supportedDataSources as JSON to standard output and exit
- Ensure other CLI flags and existing functionality remain unchanged

# CLI Usage
- Running the tool with the flag --list-sources displays all available data source URLs in JSON form
- Support invocation via npm script start

# API
- Export getSupportedDataSources from src/lib/main.js for programmatic access
- Preserve the existing main export

# Testing
- Add unit tests to verify getSupportedDataSources returns the expected array of URLs
- Add a CLI test that simulates process.argv containing --list-sources and asserts JSON output without errors

# Documentation
- Update README.md to document the list-sources feature under Features
- Include a usage example showing how to run the flag and sample output

Generated issue 2757 for feature "list-sources" with URL https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/repository0-crucible/issues/2757

title:

Implement --list-sources CLI flag and getSupportedDataSources API

And description:

## Overview

Add a new `--list-sources` CLI flag and a programmatic API to expose the list of public data source URLs supported by the library. This will allow users to discover available data sources without peeking into code.

## Changes Required

1. **src/lib/main.js**
   - Define a constant `supportedDataSources` as an array of URL strings (e.g., World Bank, REST Countries).
   - Export a function `getSupportedDataSources()` that returns `supportedDataSources`.
   - In the entrypoint `main(args)`, detect if `args` includes `"--list-sources"`. If so:
     - Print `JSON.stringify(supportedDataSources, null, 2)` to stdout.
     - Exit the process with code `0` immediately.
   - Preserve all existing behavior for other flags.

2. **tests/unit/main.test.js**
   - Add a unit test for `getSupportedDataSources()` that asserts it returns the defined array exactly.
   - Add a CLI test that simulates `process.argv = ['node','src/lib/main.js','--list-sources']`, captures `console.log`, parses the output as JSON, and asserts it matches `getSupportedDataSources()`.

3. **README.md**
   - Under **Features**, document the new **List Sources** feature.
   - In **Usage**, add an example:
     ```bash
     # List all supported public data source URLs
     npm run start -- --list-sources
     # Sample output:
     [
       "https://api.worldbank.org/v2/country",
       "https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all"
     ]
     ```

4. **package.json**
   - No changes needed: the existing `start` script already calls `node src/lib/main.js`.

## Verification

- Run `npm test` to ensure all unit and CLI tests pass.
- Execute `npm run start -- --list-sources` (or `node src/lib/main.js --list-sources`) and confirm the JSON output matches the array from `getSupportedDataSources()`.

Once these changes are merged, users will have a discoverable list of supported data sources via both CLI and API.

LLM API Usage:
```json
{"prompt_tokens":5131,"completion_tokens":1822,"total_tokens":6953,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0,"audio_tokens":0},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":1280,"audio_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0}}
```

## Issue to enhanced Issue at 2025-05-27T02:48:12.328Z

Activity:

Updated feature development issue https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/repository0-crucible/issues/ with enhanced description:

## Overview

Implement a new `--list-sources` CLI flag and a programmatic API function `getSupportedDataSources()` to expose the array of supported public data source URLs.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. In `src/lib/main.js`:
   - Define a constant `supportedDataSources` as an array of URL strings, including at minimum:
     - "https://api.worldbank.org/v2/country"
     - "https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all"
   - Export a function `getSupportedDataSources()` that returns the `supportedDataSources` array.
   - Modify the `main(args)` entrypoint so that if `args` includes `"--list-sources"`, it:
     - Prints `JSON.stringify(supportedDataSources, null, 2)` to stdout.
     - Exits the process with code `0` immediately.
   - Ensure behavior for all other flags remains unchanged.

2. In `tests/unit/main.test.js`:
   - Add a unit test verifying `getSupportedDataSources()` returns the exact `supportedDataSources` array.
   - Add a CLI integration test that:
     - Sets `process.argv` to include `"--list-sources"`.
     - Captures console output.
     - Parses the output as JSON.
     - Asserts the parsed output matches `getSupportedDataSources()`.
     - Verifies the process exits with code `0`.

3. In `README.md`:
   - Under **Features**, add a **List Sources** section describing the new flag.
   - Under **Usage**, include an example:
     ```bash
     npm run start -- --list-sources
     # Sample output:
     [
       "https://api.worldbank.org/v2/country",
       "https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all"
     ]
     ```

4. Verification:
   - Running `npm test` should pass all new and existing tests.
   - Running `npm run start -- --list-sources` should output the JSON array matching `getSupportedDataSources()` and exit with code 0.


LLM API Usage:
```json
{"prompt_tokens":5000,"completion_tokens":1231,"total_tokens":6231,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0,"audio_tokens":0},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":704,"audio_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0}}
```
