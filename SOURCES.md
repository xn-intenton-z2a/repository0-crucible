Provides a consolidated reference for foundational Semantic Web standards: RDF 1.1 Concepts, OWL 2 ontology semantics, SKOS concept schemes, and DCAT dataset catalog vocabulary. This source defines core data models, ontology constructs, concept hierarchies, and metadata catalog schemas essential for interoperable graph construction, ontology authoring, and dataset discovery. Updates: RDF 1.1 Feb 2014; OWL 2 Dec 2012; SKOS Aug 2009; DCAT Feb 2023.
