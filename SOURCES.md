Provides the foundational standards for linked data modeling, ontology semantics, and dataset cataloging. RDF 1.1 Concepts (Feb 2014) defines the graph data model and term syntax; OWL 2 Overview (Dec 2012) details ontology profiles and reasoning; SKOS Reference (Aug 2009) standardizes concept schemes; DCAT 2 (Feb 2023) specifies dataset catalogs. Critical for interoperable JSON-LD and OWL artifact design, ontology definition, and metadata management. Authoritative via W3C Working Groups.

# JSON-LD 1.1 Core & Processing Algorithms
## https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/
The definitive specification for JSON-LD 1.1 data modeling and processing, including the expand, compact, flatten, frame, and normalize algorithms. It details syntax rules, context definitions, processor requirements, and JSON-LD/URI interplay, enabling reliable serialization and deserialization of RDF and OWL ontologies in JSON. Last updated May 2020. Recognized by the W3C Semantic Web Community.

This curated set of JavaScript libraries facilitates working with RDF, JSON-LD, and SPARQL in Node.js. jsonld.js handles context framing and compaction; the RDF/JS Data Model spec ensures graph interoperability; Comunica provides federated SPARQL querying; SPARQL.js parses queries; rdflib.js manages in-memory graphs; N3.js parses and serializes Turtle/N-Quads. Essential for in-app JSON-LD OWL generation, streaming data workflows, and SPARQL integration. Actively maintained (2023â€“2024).

# RDF Validation: SHACL & ShEx
## https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/
## https://shex.io/shex-semantics/
## https://github.com/shexSpec/shex.js#readme
Defines declarative validation of RDF graphs using SHACL shapes (Core and SPARQL-based constraints) and concise ShEx schemas. The shex.js library offers streaming validation with detailed error reporting ideal for CI/CD pipelines and data integrity checks of JSON-LD OWL artifacts. SHACL published Oct 2017; ShEx semantics Feb 2020; shex.js v4.x (2023).
