# OWL 2 Web Ontology Language Overview
## https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/
The W3C OWL 2 Overview specification provides a clear introduction to the semantics, syntax, and profiles of the OWL 2 Web Ontology Language. It includes detailed examples of class axioms, property restrictions, and profile-specific constraints (EL, QL, RL) that address core implementation needs when generating or validating ontologies. Last published December 2012 and maintained by the W3C Semantic Web Activity, this document is authoritative for any OWL-based tool.

# RDF 1.1 Concepts and Abstract Syntax
## https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/
This W3C Recommendation defines the fundamental RDF 1.1 data model, including triples, graphs, IRIs, literals, and blank nodes. It also covers serialization-neutral constructs crucial for mapping JSON input into RDF graphs when building OWL JSON outputs. Published March 2014, it remains the definitive reference for RDF implementations.

# JSON-LD 1.1 Specification
## https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/
The W3C JSON-LD 1.1 specification describes the JSON-based serialization format for Linked Data, including context syntax, framing, and compaction algorithms. Provides practical examples for converting JSON payloads into RDF triples and back, directly informing how to embed OWL annotations in JSON structures. Last updated July 2020 and maintained by the W3C Community Group.

# REST Countries API
## https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all
The REST Countries API delivers comprehensive country data (names, capitals, ISO codes, geospatial coordinates, and more) via a simple HTTPS endpoint. It supports CORS and JSON output, ideal for quickly prototyping ontology individuals from live data. The documentation includes example queries, filtering parameters, and response schemas.

# DBpedia SPARQL Endpoint
## https://dbpedia.org/sparql
DBpedia’s public SPARQL endpoint exposes structured data extracted from Wikipedia. This source provides actionable guidance on SPARQL query patterns for retrieving ontology classes, properties, and entities, enabling advanced enrichment of OWL ontologies. The documentation highlights pagination, timeouts, and query optimization techniques. Data is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0.

# GeoNames Web Services
## http://www.geonames.org/export/ws-overview.html
GeoNames offers RESTful endpoints for geographic information (countries, cities, time zones, and coordinates). The overview explains parameter usage, rate limits, and response structures—critical for integrating gazetteer data into OWL individuals. Data is under CC BY 4.0, and the services require a free signup but responses are publicly accessible.

# Apache Jena Fuseki Documentation
## https://jena.apache.org/documentation/fuseki2/
The Apache Jena Fuseki guide covers installation, configuration, and command-line operations for running a SPARQL server. Includes examples for loading TTL/OWL files, executing SPARQL updates, and securing endpoints. Essential for users wanting to persist or query OWL JSON outputs via SPARQL.

# OWL API (Java) GitHub Wiki
## https://github.com/owlcs/owlapi/wiki
The OWL API GitHub Wiki provides detailed tutorials and code snippets for programmatic ontology creation, manipulation, and serialization in Java. Guides cover parsing RDF/XML, manipulating class expressions, and exporting to various syntaxes—valuable for comparative design of a JavaScript-based OWL JSON toolchain.

# JSON-LD JavaScript Library (jsonld.js)
## https://github.com/digitalbazaar/jsonld.js
The jsonld.js repository contains implementation details, usage examples, and API references for the official JSON-LD JavaScript library. It demonstrates context processing, expansion, compaction, and framing—key operations when transforming JSON data into OWL-aligned JSON-LD structures in a Node.js environment.
