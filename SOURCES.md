# W3C Semantic Web, OWL Profiles & JSON-LD Specifications
## https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/
This consolidated source delivers the definitive W3C Recommendations for RDF graph modeling (RDF 1.1), OWL 2 ontology profiles (DL, EL, QL, RL), and JSON-LD processing (Core, API, Framing). It underpins context management, compaction, expansion, dataset normalization, and programmatic JSON-LD interfaces essential for the ontology build pipeline, serialization modules, and shaping operations. Last updated July 2020. Authoritative W3C Recommendation.

# Linked Data Best Practices & Hypermedia Vocabulary
## https://www.w3.org/TR/ld-bp/
Comprehensive guidelines for HTTP-based Linked Data publication, covering IRI design, content negotiation, pagination, versioning, caching, and discoverability (Linked Data Best Practices, 2020). Includes Linked Data Platform (LDP 1.0) container semantics and the Hydra Core Vocabulary (CC0) for hypermedia-driven REST APIs over RDF. Directly informs endpoint URL schemes, HTTP methods, headers, in-band metadata, and client navigation strategies. Last updated September 2020. Authoritative W3C Recommendations and community vocabulary.

# JavaScript Libraries & RDFJS Specifications for Schema, Validation & Graph Processing
## https://github.com/colinhacks/zod#readme
A unified reference combining runtime schema validation (Zod 3.x, MIT), W3C SHACL (2023) and ShEx (CC0) graph-level constraints, the RDFJS data-model and stream-processing specifications, the OWL manipulation toolkit (owljs), and the official JSON-LD JavaScript API implementation (jsonld.js, MIT). Provides type-safe parsing, streaming graph transformations, framing, validation, and ontology manipulation in browser and Node.js environments. Last updated June 2024.

# SPARQL Engines, Triplestore Frameworks & HTTP APIs
## https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-overview/
This unified source consolidates W3C SPARQL 1.1 specs (Query, Update, Protocol) and standard RDF serializations (Turtle, N-Quads), with implementation details for Apache Jena (SPARQL & RIOT), the Comunica query engine, and persistent triplestores such as Jena TDB2 and Eclipse RDF4J. It also covers HTTP-based SPARQL endpoints, RESTful transaction management, configuration, optimization strategies, and security practices for production-grade integrations. Published 2013–2024.

# Web Platform, Protocol & Date-Time Standards
## https://nodejs.org/api/
Merges Node.js Core (v20+) documentation for filesystem, HTTP server, streams, and ESM loader architecture; the WHATWG Fetch standard; HTTP/1.1 semantics (RFC 7231); and internet timestamps (RFC 3339). Offers practical guidance for CLI I/O, HTTP handling, content negotiation, and interoperable date-time formatting in both server and CLI contexts. Last reviewed March 2024.

# ROBOT: Release OWL Ontology Builder
## https://github.com/ontodev/robot#readme
ROBOT is a comprehensive CLI and Java library (Apache 2.0) for automating OWL ontology workflows: module extraction, reasoning, merging, format conversion, validation, and release packaging. Its best-practice patterns for ontology versioning, provenance tracking, and CI integration inform the repository’s build and release pipelines. Last release April 2024; widely adopted by the OBO Foundry community.

# RDF Graph Shape Validation Standards: SHACL & ShEx
## https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/
This unified specification covers both the W3C SHACL Recommendation for RDF graph validation—defining core shapes, property constraints, targets, SPARQL-based extensibility, and rule extensions—and the community-driven Shape Expressions (ShEx) grammar for high-performance shape definitions and streaming validation (see also https://shex.io/shex-semantics/). Essential for enforcing graph integrity in ontology pipelines, providing declarative shape languages for automated validation across different use cases. Last updated July 2023 (SHACL) and February 2023 (ShEx). Authoritative W3C and community standards.

# Comunica SPARQL Query Engine Documentation
## https://comunica.dev/docs/
The official documentation for the Comunica modular SPARQL query engine (MIT licensed) provides in-depth guidance on programmatic use of the QueryEngine API, configuring data sources (RDF files, HTTP endpoints, streams), advanced actors (join, filter, pattern), query optimization strategies, and CLI tooling. It covers integration with RDFJS sources, how to build custom query pipelines, using plugins, and performance tuning. Last updated 2024. Maintained by the Comunica community and reference implementation authors.
