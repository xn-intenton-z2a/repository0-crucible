# JSON-LD 1.1 Specification
## https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/
The JSON-LD 1.1 specification defines a JSON-based format to serialize Linked Data. It covers context definitions, framing, compaction, expansion, and RDF conversion rules, essential for implementing JSON-LD OWL ontologies. Its precise algorithmic details and examples for context creation and document processing guide the generateOntology implementation in edge cases. Last updated 16 July 2019. Considered authoritative as the W3C Recommendation.
