# W3C OWL 2 Web Ontology Language Document Overview

## https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/
The OWL 2 Overview provides the W3C Recommendation for OWL 2, covering classes, properties, individuals, datatypes, and expression constructs. It details the OWL 2 RDF-based syntax, formal semantics, and includes programmatic examples for building and serializing ontologies. Essential for understanding the core ontology concepts and ensuring compliance with the latest OWL 2 standard. (Last updated 27 October 2009; authoritative as a W3C Recommendation.)

# W3C RDF 1.1 Concepts and Abstract Syntax

## https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/
This specification defines the RDF data model: triples, graphs, IRIs, literals, and blank nodes. It provides guidance on parsing and serializing RDF in formats like Turtle, RDF/XML, and JSON-LD. Foundational for any implementation handling RDF data, ensuring interoperability across tools and frameworks. (Last updated 25 February 2014; authoritative as a W3C Recommendation.)

# JSON-LD 1.1: A JSON-Based Serialization for Linked Data

## https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/
The JSON-LD 1.1 spec covers framing, compaction, expansion, and context processing to map JSON documents to RDF graphs. It describes processing algorithms, error handling, and integration patterns for embedding linked data within web applications. Critical for converting raw JSON into OWL-ready RDF structures with minimal overhead. (Last updated 16 May 2020; authoritative as a W3C Recommendation.)

# SPARQL 1.1 Query Language

## https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/
This document specifies the SPARQL 1.1 query and update language, including SELECT, ASK, CONSTRUCT, and DESCRIBE forms, along with aggregation, subqueries, and update operations. It defines formal grammar, evaluation semantics, and optimization strategies, indispensable for executing advanced graph queries against RDF datasets and OWL ontologies. (Last updated 21 March 2013; authoritative as a W3C Recommendation.)
