# W3C RDF 1.1, OWL 2 Profiles & Semantics

## https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/

This consolidated source provides the high-level document overview of the OWL 2 Web Ontology Language and links to all foundational W3C Recommendations: RDF 1.1 Concepts & Abstract Syntax, OWL 2 Ontology Profiles (DL, EL, QL, RL), OWL 2 Structural Specification, OWL 2 Direct Semantics, and OWL 2 Mapping to RDF Graphs. It underpins context management, framing, reasoning, consistency checking, normalization, and serialization steps in the ontology build pipeline by defining graph modeling semantics, profile conformance, formal semantics, and RDF mapping. Last updated December 2012 for OWL 2; RDF 1.1 parts last updated June 2014. Authoritative W3C Recommendation.

# W3C JSON-LD 1.1 Core, API & Processing Algorithms

## https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/

This source provides the W3C Recommendation for JSON-LD 1.1 Core Processing Algorithms, Data Model, Syntax, and JSON-LD API for programmatic manipulation (compact, expand, flatten, frame). It defines context handling, framing semantics, and RDF conversion critical for JSON-LD operations in this repository. Last updated June 2020 (Core) and January 2022 (API). Authoritative W3C Recommendation.

# Linked Data Best Practices & Hypermedia Vocabulary

## https://www.w3.org/TR/ld-bp/

Comprehensive guidelines for publishing and consuming HTTP-based Linked Data, covering IRI design, content negotiation, pagination, versioning, caching, and discoverability. Includes the Linked Data Platform (LDP 1.0) container semantics and Hydra Core Vocabulary (CC0) for hypermedia-driven REST APIs over RDF, directly informing endpoint schemes, HTTP methods, headers, and client navigation strategies.

# JavaScript Libraries & RDFJS Specifications

## https://github.com/colinhacks/zod#readme

A unified reference for runtime schema validation (Zod 3.x), W3C SHACL (July 2023) and ShEx (February 2023) shape definitions, the RDFJS data model and stream-processing specifications, the OWL manipulation toolkit (owljs), and the official JSON-LD JavaScript API implementation (jsonld.js). Provides type-safe parsing, streaming graph transformations, framing, validation, and ontology manipulation in browser and Node.js environments. Last updated June 2024. Maintained by open-source communities.

# SPARQL Engines, Triplestores & HTTP APIs

## https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-overview/

This unified source consolidates W3C SPARQL 1.1 specifications (Query, Update, Protocol) and standard RDF serializations (Turtle, N-Quads), with implementation guidance for Apache Jena (SPARQL & RIOT), Eclipse RDF4J, and modular engines like Comunica (QueryEngine API). It also covers HTTP-based SPARQL endpoints, RESTful transaction management, configuration, optimization strategies, and security practices for production-grade integrations. Published 2013–2024. Authoritative W3C Recommendations and community implementations.

# RDF Graph Shape Validation Standards: SHACL & ShEx

## https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/

This source covers the W3C SHACL Recommendation for RDF graph validation—defining core shapes, property constraints, targets, and SPARQL-based extensions—and the community-driven Shape Expressions (ShEx) grammar for high-performance shape definitions and streaming validation. Essential for enforcing graph integrity and declarative validation in ontology pipelines. Last updated July 2023 (SHACL) and February 2023 (ShEx).
