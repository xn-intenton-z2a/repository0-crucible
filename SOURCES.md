# JSON-LD 1.1 Specification
## https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/
The official W3C Recommendation for JSON-LD 1.1 outlines the data model, processing algorithms, and serialization formats (JSON and JSON-LD) for linked data. It provides detailed information on @context definitions, term expansion, compaction, framing, and @graph management. This is essential for implementing JSON-LD output, ensuring that @context handling in generateOntology aligns with the standard. (Published July 16, 2020)

# OWL 2 Web Ontology Language Overview
## https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/
This W3C Recommendation introduces the key concepts, constructs, and profiles (OWL 2 DL, EL, QL, RL) of the OWL 2 ontology language. It explains class hierarchies, properties, individuals, and ontology IRI roles. Vital for understanding how to structure the @graph nodes and choose appropriate OWL constructs in the JSON-LD document. (Published October 27, 2009)

# OWL 2 Quick Reference
## https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-quick-reference/
A concise reference sheet of OWL 2 syntax in functional, RDF/XML, and Manchester formats. Includes common vocabulary IRIs (e.g., owl:Class, rdf:Property) and axioms. Helps developers map JavaScript objects to OWL 2 terms when building graph nodes, ensuring correct @id and term properties. (Published October 27, 2009)

# jsonld.js (JavaScript JSON-LD API)
## https://github.com/digitalbazaar/jsonld.js
An open-source JavaScript library for JSON-LD operations: expansion, compaction, framing, normalization, and more. Offers low-level APIs to manipulate contexts and graphs, with streaming support and promise-based methods. Useful as a reference or fallback for advanced JSON-LD transformations beyond simple @context and @graph generation. (Last updated 2024)

# RDF/JS Specification
## https://rdf.js.org/
Defines standard interfaces for RDF data structures (Term, Quad, Dataset) in JavaScript, enabling interoperability between RDF libraries. Although generateOntology produces JSON-LD objects directly, understanding RDF/JS can guide extension towards streaming data, quad management, or integration with RDF stores. (Latest version 2023)

# Zod Schema Validation
## https://github.com/colinhacks/zod
Zod is a TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library. The CLI uses Zod to validate subcommand options (e.g., --input, --ontology-iri). Its documentation covers schema creation, parsing, async transforms, and custom error formattingâ€”key for robust option handling in the convert and capital-cities commands. (Last release May 2024)
