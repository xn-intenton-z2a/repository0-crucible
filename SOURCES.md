# W3C OWL 2 Web Ontology Language Document Overview

## https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/
The OWL 2 Overview provides a comprehensive introduction to the Web Ontology Language, covering key concepts such as classes, properties, individuals, datatypes, and expressions. It specifies the OWL 2 RDF-based syntax and formal semantics, with actionable examples for constructing ontologies programmatically. This source is authoritative as the W3C Recommendation for OWL 2 and addresses core implementation needs for ontology modeling and serialization. (Last updated 27 October 2009)
