# JSON-LD 1.1 Specification
## https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/
The official W3C Recommendation for JSON-LD 1.1 outlines the data model, processing algorithms, and serialization formats (JSON and JSON-LD) for linked data. It provides detailed information on @context definitions, term expansion, compaction, framing, and @graph management. This is essential for implementing JSON-LD output, ensuring that @context handling in generateOntology aligns with the standard. (Published July 16, 2020)
