# Node.js Core API Reference
## https://nodejs.org/api/
Comprehensive reference for all built-in Node.js modules, including `fs`, `path`, `url`, `http/https`, `process`, `readline`, and streams. Covers file I/O, environment variables, HTTP server/client APIs, event-driven patterns, module resolution, and signal handling. Essential for implementing CLI flags (`--face`, `--list-*`), parsing files, and managing shutdown in both non-interactive and HTTP server modes. Last updated June 2024; maintained by the Node.js Foundation.

# Node.js HTTP Module
## https://nodejs.org/api/http.html
Deep dive into Node.js core HTTP APIs: `http.createServer`, `IncomingMessage`, `ServerResponse`, request/response headers, status codes, and streaming. Explains low-level routing, response serialization, and CORS header managementâ€”critical for building the built-in HTTP JSON endpoints (`/face`, `/list-faces`, `/diagnostics`, `/openapi.json`) and graceful server shutdown.

# Node.js Readline Module
## https://nodejs.org/api/readline.html
Provides interfaces for reading lines from input streams, interactive prompts, and handling user events. Details on `readline.createInterface`, question/answer patterns, asynchronous iteration, and history control. Crucial for implementing the interactive REPL (`--interactive`) that processes commands without restarting the CLI. Last updated June 2024; maintained by the Node.js Foundation.
