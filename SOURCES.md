# W3C Semantic Web, OWL Profiles & JSON-LD Specifications
## https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/
This consolidated source delivers the definitive W3C Recommendations for modeling and serializing RDF graphs (RDF 1.1 Concepts), defining OWL 2 ontologies (Profiles DL, EL, QL, RL), and working with JSON-LD (Core, API, Framing). It underpins context management, compaction, expansion, dataset normalization, and programmatic interfaces essential for the ontology build pipeline, serialization modules, and JSON-LD shaping operations. Last updated July 2020. Authoritative W3C Recommendation.

# Linked Data Best Practices & Hypermedia Vocabulary
## https://www.w3.org/TR/ld-bp/
Comprehensive guidelines for HTTP-based Linked Data publication, covering IRI design, content negotiation, pagination, versioning, caching, and discoverability (Linked Data Best Practices, 2020), combined with the Linked Data Platform (LDP 1.0, 2015) container semantics and the Hydra Core Vocabulary (CC0) for hypermedia-driven REST APIs over RDF. Directly informs endpoint URL schemes, HTTP methods, headers, in-band metadata, and client navigation strategies.
