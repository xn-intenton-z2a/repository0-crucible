# W3C OWL 2 Web Ontology Language Document Overview

## https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/
The OWL 2 Overview is the definitive W3C Recommendation for OWL 2, detailing classes, properties, individuals, datatypes, axioms, profiles, and RDF-based serializations. It includes formal semantics, conformance criteria, and programmatic examples for authoring and validating OWL 2 ontologies. Essential for ensuring compliance with the latest OWL 2 standard and understanding core modeling constructs. (Last updated 27 October 2009; authoritative as a W3C Recommendation.)

# W3C RDF 1.1 Concepts and Abstract Syntax

## https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/
Defines the RDF 1.1 data model: IRIs, literals, blank nodes, triples, and graphs, along with canonical parsing and serialization forms (Turtle, RDF/XML, JSON-LD). Provides the abstract syntax and formal semantics that underpin RDF-based tools and frameworks, ensuring interoperability across implementations. (Last updated 25 February 2014; authoritative as a W3C Recommendation.)

# JSON-LD 1.1: A JSON-Based Serialization for Linked Data

## https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/
Covers JSON-LD framing, compaction, expansion, and context processing to map JSON documents to RDF graphs. Describes the processing algorithms, error handling, extension points, and best practices for embedding linked data in web applications. Critical for ingesting and emitting JSON-LD in OWL builder pipelines with minimal overhead. (Last updated 16 May 2020; authoritative as a W3C Recommendation.)

# SPARQL 1.1 Query Language

## https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/
Specifies SPARQL 1.1 query forms (SELECT, ASK, CONSTRUCT, DESCRIBE), aggregation, subqueries, property paths, federation, and update operations. Defines the grammar, evaluation semantics, optimization considerations, and result formats. Indispensable for executing complex graph queries and mutating RDF datasets or OWL ontologies. (Last updated 21 March 2013; authoritative as a W3C Recommendation.)

# rdflib.js: Linked Data Library for JavaScript

## https://linkeddata.github.io/rdflib.js/
A modular JavaScript library for parsing, storing, querying, and serializing RDF in both browser and Node.js environments. Documentation covers core components (Store, Fetcher, UpdateManager), support for Turtle, RDF/XML, N3, JSON-LD, and integration patterns. Provides practical examples for building in-memory graph applications and federated HTTP queries. Vital for integrating semantic technologies into JavaScript-based OWL builder workflows. (Latest version 2.2.2.)

# Comunica SPARQL Query Engine

## https://comunica.dev/docs/query/overview/
Comunica is a modular, pluggable SPARQL query engine for JavaScript and TypeScript, supporting federated queries over HTTP, Linked Data Fragments, and in-memory RDFJS sources. Documentation includes architecture overviews, installation instructions, examples for programmatic API use, streaming results, and custom data source integration. Critical for high-performance, distributed query execution in CLI tools and web services. (Reviewed April 2024.)

# Apache Jena Fuseki HTTP API

## https://jena.apache.org/documentation/fuseki2/http-api.html
Details REST endpoints for dataset management, SPARQL query and update operations, named graph administration, authentication, and performance tuning. Includes request/response examples in JSON and XML, HTTP status codes, and configuration options for robust triple store integration in data ingestion pipelines. (Last updated March 2021.)

# Wikidata Query Service User Manual

## https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:SPARQL_query_service/queries
The official guide to Wikidataâ€™s SPARQL endpoint, explaining query best practices, result formats (JSON, CSV, XML), constraints, rate limits, and performance considerations. Provides numerous real-world query examples, federated patterns, and tips for retrieving and transforming large-scale, multilingual ontology data. Invaluable for sourcing rich entity graphs and testing OWL builder query capabilities against a live knowledge base. (Last updated 2024; content available under CC0.)
