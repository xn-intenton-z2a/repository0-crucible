# owl-builder

owl-builder is a CLI tool and JavaScript library for building dynamic OWL ontologies from live, verified public data sources.
In this release, live data integration is the default for building, updating, querying, and persisting ontologies, while 
the legacy static fallback remains for emergency use only.

Key features include:

- **Live Data Integration:** Ontologies are built using up-to-date data from trusted public endpoints.
- **Data Persistence:** Easily save, load, backup, clear, refresh, and merge ontologies as JSON files.
- **Query & Validation:** Rapidly search for ontology concepts and validate your data.
- **OWL Export/Import:** Convert ontologies to and from a minimal OWL XML format.
- **Concurrent Data Crawling:** Gather real-time data concurrently from a range of public endpoints.
- **Diverse Ontology Models:** Build various models (basic, advanced, intermediate, enhanced, minimal, complex, scientific, educational, philosophical, economic, and hybrid).
- **Enhanced Diagnostics:** View timestamped logs for monitoring and troubleshooting.
- **Web Server Integration:** Launch a simple web server for quick status checks.
- **Custom Merging & Refreshing:** New functions provide extended merging and diagnostic capabilities.
