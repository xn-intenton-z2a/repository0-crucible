Server-sent eventsNote: This feature is available in Web Workers.
Traditionally, a web page has to send a request to the server to receive new data; that is, the page requests data from the server. With server-sent events, it's possible for a server to send new data to a web page at any time, by pushing messages to the web page. These incoming messages can be treated as Events + data inside the web page.Concepts and usageTo learn how to use server-sent events, see our article Using server-sent events.Interfaces

It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).
"Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.
HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special "elements" such as <head>, <title>, <body>, <header>, <footer>, <article>, <section>, <p>, <div>, <span>, <img>, <aside>, <audio>, <canvas>, <datalist>, <details>, <embed>, <nav>, <search>, <output>, <progress>, <video>, <ul>, <ol>, <li> and many others.
An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which consist of the element name surrounded by < and >. The name of an element inside a tag is case-insensitive. That is, it can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the <title> tag can be written as <Title>, <TITLE>, or in any other way. However, the convention and recommended practice is to write tags in lowercase.

Your first website: Creating the content

This article provides a brief tour of what HTML is and how to use it, aimed at people who are completely new to web development.

Structuring content with HTML

Our Learn web development section's HTML module teaches all the HTML fundamentals from the ground up.

Guides
HTML forms

Forms are a very important part of the Web — these provide much of the functionality you need for interacting with websites, e.g., registering and logging in, sending feedback, buying products, and more. This module gets you started with creating the client-side/front-end parts of forms.

CORS enabled image

The crossorigin attribute, in combination with an appropriate CORS header, allows images defined by the <img> element to be loaded from foreign origins and used in a <canvas> element as if they were being loaded from the current origin.

CORS settings attributes

Some HTML elements that provide support for CORS, such as <img> or <video>, have a crossorigin attribute (crossOrigin property), which lets you configure the CORS requests for the element's fetched data.

Preloading content with rel="preload"

The preload value of the <link> element's rel attribute allows you to write declarative fetch requests in your HTML <head>, specifying resources that your pages will need very soon after loading, which you therefore want to start preloading early in the lifecycle of a page load, before the browser's main rendering machinery kicks in. This ensures that they are made available earlier and are less likely to block the page's first render, leading to performance improvements. This article provides a basic guide to how preload works.

Responsive images

In this article, we'll learn about the concept of responsive images — images that work well on devices with widely differing screen sizes, resolutions, and other such features — and look at what tools HTML provides to help implement them. This helps to improve performance across different devices.

Reference
HTML reference

HTML consists of elements, each of which may be modified by some number of attributes. HTML documents are connected to each other with links.

HTML element reference

Browse a list of all HTML elements.

HTML attribute reference

Elements in HTML have attributes. These are additional values that configure the elements or adjust their behavior in various ways.

Global attributes

Global attributes may be specified on all HTML elements, even those not specified in the standard. This means that any non-standard elements must still permit these attributes, even though those elements make the document HTML5-noncompliant.

Inline-level elements and block-level elements

HTML elements are usually "inline-level" or "block-level" elements. An inline-level element occupies only the space bounded by the tags that define it. A block-level element occupies the entire space of its parent element (container), thereby creating a "block box".

HTML comments

HTML comments are used to add explanatory notes to the markup or to prevent the browser from interpreting specific parts of the document.

Guide to media types and formats on the web

The <audio> and <video> elements allow you to play audio and video media natively within your content without the need for external software support.

HTML content categories

HTML is comprised of several kinds of content, each of which is allowed to be used in certain contexts and is disallowed in others. Similarly, each context has a set of other content categories it can contain and elements that can or can't be used in them. This is a guide to these categories.

Quirks mode and standards mode

While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g., functional programming) styles.
JavaScript's dynamic capabilities include runtime object construction, variable parameter lists, function variables, dynamic script creation (via eval), object introspection (via for...in and Object utilities), and source-code recovery (JavaScript functions store their source text and can be retrieved through toString()).
This section is dedicated to the JavaScript language itself, and not the parts that are specific to Web pages or other host environments. For information about APIs that are specific to Web pages, please see Web APIs and DOM.
The standards for JavaScript are the ECMAScript Language Specification (ECMA-262) and the ECMAScript Internationalization API specification (ECMA-402). As soon as one browser implements a feature, we try to document it. This means that cases where some proposals for new ECMAScript features have already been implemented in browsers, documentation and examples in MDN articles may use some of those new features. Most of the time, this happens between the stages 3 and 4, and is usually before the spec is officially published.
Do not confuse JavaScript with the Java programming language — JavaScript is not "Interpreted Java". Both "Java" and "JavaScript" are trademarks or registered trademarks of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries. However, the two programming languages have very different syntax, semantics, and use.
JavaScript documentation of core language features (pure ECMAScript, for the most part) includes the following:

It was designed for communication between web browsers and web servers, but it can also be used for other purposes, such as machine-to-machine communication, programmatic access to APIs, and more.
HTTP follows a classical client-server model, with a client opening a connection to make a request, then waiting until it receives a response from the server.
HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning that the server does not keep any session data between two requests, although the later addition of cookies adds state to some client-server interactions.ReferenceThe HTTP reference documentation contains detailed information about headers, request methods, status responses, and lists relevant specifications and standards documents.

HTTP headers

Message headers are used to send metadata about a resource or a HTTP message, and to describe the behavior of the client or the server.

HTTP request methods

Request methods indicate the purpose of the request and what is expected if the request is successful.
The most common methods are GET and POST for retrieving and sending data to servers, respectively, but there are other methods which serve different purposes.

HTTP response status codes

Response status codes indicate the outcome of a specific HTTP request.
Responses are grouped in five classes: informational, successful, redirections, client errors, and server errors.

HTTP resources and specifications

This page lists relevant resources about HTTP since it was first specified in the early 1990s.


The following subsections are also notable:

CSP directives

The Content-Security-Policy (CSP) response header allows website administrators to specify which resources the user agent is allowed to load for a given page.
This section lists directives that can be used in a CSP header, with individual documentation pages that describe how the directives work and how to use them.

Permissions-Policy directives

The Permissions-Policy response header provides a mechanism to allow or deny the use of browser features in a document or within any <iframe> element in the document.
This section lists directives that can be used in a Permissions-Policy header, with individual documentation pages that describe how the directives work and how to use them.

GuidesHTTP is an extensible protocol that relies on concepts like resources and Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), a basic message structure, and client-server communication model.
On top of these concepts, numerous extensions have been developed over the years that add functionality and updated semantics, including additional HTTP methods and headers.
The HTTP guides are listed in order from general overviews to specialized, use-case-driven topics.
Beginners are encouraged to start with the foundational guides before exploring more focused articles.

Overview of HTTP

The basic features of HTTP, what it can do, its intended use in web architecture, and its position in the protocol stack.

Evolution of HTTP

HTTP was created in the early 1990s and has been extended several times.
This article goes through its history and describes HTTP/0.9, HTTP/1.0, HTTP/1.1, through HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, as well as novelties introduced over the years.

A typical HTTP session

Describes the flow of an HTTP session, from establishing a connection, sending a request, to receiving a response.

HTTP messages

HTTP messages transmitted as requests and responses have a defined structure.
This article describes this general structure, its purpose, and the different types of messages.

MIME types

Since HTTP/1.0, different types of content can be transmitted.
This article explains how this is accomplished using the Content-Type header and the MIME standard.
A shortlist of common types used by web developers can be found in Common MIME types.

Compression in HTTP

Browsers and servers compress their messages before sending them over the network to reduce the amount of data that needs to be transmitted, improving transfer speed and bandwidth utilization.

HTTP caching

Caching is a highly important mechanism for delivering fast experiences on the Web and for efficient use of resources.
This article describes different methods of caching and how to use HTTP headers to control them.

HTTP authentication

Authentication is a way to verify the identity of a client when making requests to a server.
It ensures that only authorized users or systems can access certain resources.

Using HTTP cookies

Although HTTP is a stateless protocol, a server can send a Set-Cookie header with the response.
The client then returns the cookie's value with every subsequent request to the server in the form of a Cookie request header.
This adds the ability to store and exchange a small amount of data which effectively adds state to some client-server interactions.

Redirections in HTTP

URL redirection, also known as URL forwarding, is a technique to give more than one URL address to a page, a form, a whole website, or a web application.
HTTP has a special kind of response, called a HTTP redirect, for this operation.

HTTP conditional requests

In conditional requests, the outcome of a request depends on the value of a validator in the request.
This method is used heavily in caching and use cases such as resuming a download, preventing lost updates when modifying a document on the server, and more.

HTTP range requests

A range request asks the server to send a specific part (or parts) of a resource back to a client instead of the full resource.
Range requests are useful for cases when a client knows they need only part of a large file, or for cases where an application allows the user to pause and resume a download.

Content negotiation

HTTP defines a set of message headers, starting with Accept as a way for a browser to announce the format, language, or encoding it prefers.
This article explains how this advertisement happens, how the server is expected to react, and how it chooses the most adequate response to a request.

Connection management in HTTP/1.x

HTTP/1.1 was the first version of HTTP to support persistent connections and pipelining.
This article explains both concepts, including the pros and cons of each.

Protocol upgrade mechanism

HTTP/1.1 provides a mechanism to upgrade an already-established connection to a different protocol using the Upgrade header.
A client can upgrade a connection from HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/2, or an HTTP(S) connection to a WebSocket (ws / wss).

Proxy servers and tunneling

A proxy can be on the user's local computer, or anywhere between the user's computer and a destination server on the Internet.
This page outlines some basics about proxies and introduces a few configuration options.

HTTP Client hints

Client Hints are a set of response headers that a server can use to proactively request information from a client about the device, network, user, and user-agent-specific preferences.
The server can then determine which resources to send, based on the information that the client chooses to provide.

Network Error Logging 
Experimental


Network Error Logging is a mechanism that can be configured via the NEL HTTP response header.
This experimental header allows websites and applications to opt-in to receive reports about failed (or even successful) network fetches from supporting browsers.

Browser detection using the user agent

It's very rarely a good idea to use user agent sniffing to detect a browser, but there are edge cases that require it.
This document will guide you in doing this as correctly as possible when this is necessary, with an emphasis on considerations to make before embarking on this route.

Security and privacy
Permissions Policy

Permissions Policy provides mechanisms for web developers to explicitly declare what functionality can and cannot be used on a website.
You define a set of "policies" that restrict what APIs the site's code can access or modify the browser's default behavior for certain features.

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

Cross-site HTTP requests are requests for resources from a different domain than that of the resource making the request.
Web pages today very commonly load cross-site resources, for example, a page 'Domain A' (http://domaina.example/) requests an image on 'Domain B' (http://domainb.foo/image.jpg) via the img element.
CORS allows web developers to control how their site reacts to cross-site requests.

Content Security Policy (CSP)

CSP allows website administrators to use the Content-Security-Policy response header to control which resources the client is allowed to load for a given page.
The CSP guide describes the overall Content Security Policy mechanism which helps detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks.

Cross-Origin Resource Policy (CORP)

CORP lets websites and applications opt in to protection against specific requests from other origins (such as those issued with elements like <script> and <img>), to mitigate speculative side-channel attacks.

– (W3C - Accessibility)
Accessibility guidesThe Accessibility guides cover authoring principles, WCAG compliance, accessible widgets and navigation, mobile accessibility, and other key topics that will help you understand why accessibility is crucial for the web and how to improve it in your projects.

Accessibility information for web authors

This document lists guidelines and regulations, how-to's, and tools for checking and repairing accessibility problems with websites.

Personalization to help browse safely

This article discusses making web content accessible for those with vestibular disorders, and those who support them, by taking advantage of personalization and accessibility settings built into the operating systems.

Accessible web applications and widgets

Most JavaScript libraries offer a library of client-side widgets that mimic the behavior of familiar desktop interfaces.
While this results in a widget that looks like its desktop counterpart, there usually isn't enough semantic information in the markup to be usable by an assistive technology.
This document describes techniques to improve accessibility of such widgets.

Keyboard-navigable JavaScript widgets

Until now, web developers who wanted to make their styled <div> and <span> based widgets accessible have lacked proper techniques.
Keyboard accessibility is part of the minimum accessibility requirements, which a developer should be aware of.
This document describes techniques to make JavaScript widgets accessible with the keyboard.

Mobile accessibility checklist

This document provides a concise checklist of accessibility requirements for mobile app developers.

Understanding the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)

A set of articles that provide quick explanations to help you understand the steps that need to be taken to conform to the recommendations outlined in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).

Cognitive accessibility

Cognitive accessibility covers accessibility considerations for people with cognition and learning disabilities.
This document introduces cognitive accessibility and improving accessibility of the web for people with cognitive and learning differences.

Accessibility and spatial patterns

This document describes visual patterns that can induce physical symptoms in people who have photosensitive epilepsy, vestibular disorders, or other perceptual issues.

Web Accessibility: Understanding Colors and Luminance

While understanding color, luminance, and saturation is important for design and readability for all sighted users, they are essential for those with reduced vision and color-deficient vision and those with specific neurological, cognitive, and other impairments.

Web accessibility for seizures and physical reactions

Some types of visual web content can induce seizures in people with certain brain disorders.
This article helps you understand the types of content that can be problematic and find tools and strategies to help you avoid them.

ARIA

This is a collection of articles to learn how to use Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) to make your HTML documents more accessible.

Tutorials for beginnersThe MDN Accessibility Learning Area contains modern, up-to-date tutorials covering the following accessibility essentials:

What is accessibility?

This article starts off the module with a good look at what accessibility actually is — this includes what groups of people we need to consider and why, what tools different people use to interact with the Web, and how we can make accessibility part of our web development workflow.

HTML: A good basis for accessibility

A great deal of web content can be made accessible just by making sure that the correct HTML elements are used for the correct purpose at all times. This article looks in detail at how HTML can be used to ensure maximum accessibility.

CSS and JavaScript accessibility best practices

CSS and JavaScript, when used properly, also have the potential to allow for accessible web experiences. They can significantly harm accessibility if misused. This article outlines some CSS and JavaScript best practices that should be considered to ensure that even complex content is as accessible as possible.

WAI-ARIA basics

Following on from the previous article, sometimes making complex UI controls that involve unsemantic HTML and dynamic JavaScript-updated content can be difficult. WAI-ARIA is a technology that can help with such problems by adding in further semantics that browsers and assistive technologies can recognize and let users know what is going on. Here we'll show how to use it at a basic level to improve accessibility.

Accessible multimedia

Another category of content that can create accessibility problems is multimedia — video, audio, and image content need to be given proper textual alternatives so that they can be understood by assistive technologies and their users. This article shows how.

Mobile accessibility

With web access on mobile devices being so popular and popular platforms such as iOS and Android having fully-fledged accessibility tools, it is important to consider the accessibility of your web content on these platforms. This article looks at mobile-specific accessibility considerations.

HTML is the technology that defines the content and structure of any website. Written properly, it should also define the semantics (meaning) of the content in a machine-readable way, which is vital for accessibility, search engine optimization, and making use of the built-in features browsers provide for content to work optimally. This module covers the basics of the language, before looking at key areas such as document structure, links, lists, images, forms, and more.PrerequisitesBefore starting this module, you don't need any previous HTML knowledge, but you should have at least basic familiarity with using computers and using the web passively (i.e., just looking at it and consuming content). You should have a basic work environment set up (as detailed in Installing basic software), and understand how to create and manage files (as detailed in Dealing with files). Both are parts of our Getting started with the web complete beginner's module.

If you are working on a computer/tablet/other device where you don't have the ability to create your own files, you could try out (most of) the code examples in an online coding program such as JSBin or Glitch.
Tutorials and challenges
Basic HTML syntax

Covers the absolute basics of HTML, to get you started — we define elements, attributes, and other important terms, and show where they fit in the language. We also show how a typical HTML page is structured and how an HTML element is structured, and explain other important basic language features. Along the way, we'll play with some HTML to get you interested!

What's in the head? Web page metadata

The head of an HTML document is the part that is not displayed in the web browser when the page is loaded. It contains metadata information such as the page <title>, links to CSS (if you want to style your HTML content with CSS), links to custom favicons, and metadata (data about the HTML, such as who wrote it, and important keywords that describe the document).

Headings and paragraphs

One of HTML's main jobs is to give text structure so that a browser can display an HTML document the way its developer intends. This article explains how HTML can be used to provide fundamental page structure by defining headings and paragraphs.

Emphasis and importance

The previous article looked at why semantics are important in HTML, and focused on headings and paragraphs. This article continues on the theme of semantics, looking at HTML elements that apply emphasis and importance to text (parallel to italics and bold text in print media).

Lists

Lists are everywhere in life—from your shopping list to the list of directions you subconsciously follow to get to your house every day, to the lists of instructions you are following in these tutorials! It may not surprise you that HTML has a convenient set of elements that allows us to define different types of list. On the web, we have three types of lists: unordered, ordered, and description lists. This lesson shows you how to use the different types.

Structuring documents

In addition to defining individual parts of your page (such as "a paragraph" or "an image"), HTML also boasts a number of block level elements used to define areas of your website (such as "the header", "the navigation menu", "the main content column"). This article looks into how to plan a basic website structure, and write the HTML to represent this structure.

Advanced text features

There are many other elements in HTML for defining text semantics, which we didn't get to in the Emphasis and importance article. The elements described in this article are less known, but still useful to know about (and this is still not a complete list by any means). Here you'll learn about marking up quotations, computer code and other related text, subscript and superscript, contact information, and more.

Creating links

Links (also known as hyperlinks) are really important — they are what makes the Web a web. This article shows the syntax required to make a link, and discusses link best practices.

Marking up a letter Challenge

We all learn to write a letter sooner or later; it is also a useful example to test our text formatting skills. In this challenge, you'll have a letter to mark up as a test for your HTML text formatting skills, as well as hyperlinks and proper use of the HTML <head> element.

Structuring a page of content Challenge

Structuring a page of content ready for laying it out using CSS is a very important skill to master, so in this challenge you'll be tested on your ability to think about how a page might end up looking, and choose appropriate structural semantics to build a layout on top of.

HTML images

In the beginning, the web was just text, and it was really quite boring. Fortunately, it wasn't too long before the ability to embed images (and other more interesting types of content) inside web pages was added. In this article we'll look at how to use the <img> element in depth, including the basics, annotating it with captions using <figure>, and detailing how it relates to CSS background images.

HTML video and audio

Now that we are comfortable with adding simple images to a webpage, the next step is to start adding video and audio players to your HTML documents! In this article we'll look at doing just that with the <video> and <audio> elements; we'll then finish off by looking at how to add captions/subtitles to your videos.

Mozilla splash page Challenge

In this challenge, we'll test your knowledge of some of the techniques discussed in the last couple of lessons, getting you to add some images and video to a funky splash page all about Mozilla!

HTML table basics

This article gets you started with HTML tables, covering the very basics such as rows, cells, headings, making cells span multiple columns and rows, and how to group together all the cells in a column for styling purposes.

HTML table accessibility

In this article we look at more HTML table accessibility features such as captions/summaries, grouping your rows into table head, body and footer sections, and scoping columns and rows.

Structuring a planet data table Challenge

In this challenge, we provide you with some data on the planets in our solar system. Your job is to structure it into an accessible HTML table.

Forms and buttons in HTML

HTML forms and buttons are powerful tools for interacting with users — most commonly they are used for collecting data from users or allowing them to control a user interface. In this article we provide an introduction to the basics of forms and buttons.

Debugging HTML

Writing HTML is fine, but what if something goes wrong, and you can't work out where the error in the code is? This article will introduce you to some tools that can help you find and fix errors in HTML.

Test your skills: HTML

This page lists HTML tests you can try so you can verify if you've understood the content in this module.

Additional tutorialsThese tutorials are not part of the learning pathway, but they are interesting nonetheless — you should consider these as stretch goals, to optionally study when you are done with the main Core articles.

Including vector graphics in HTML

Vector graphics are very useful in many circumstances — they have small file sizes and are highly scalable, so they don't pixelate when zoomed in or blown up to a large size. In this article we'll show you how to include one in your webpage.

From object to iframe — general embedding technologies

Developers commonly think of embedding media such as images, video and audio into web pages. In this article we take somewhat of a sideways step, looking at some elements that allow you to embed a wide variety of content types into your webpages: the <iframe>, <embed> and <object> elements. <iframe>s are for embedding other web pages, and the other two allow you to embed external resources such as PDF files.

Tutorials and challenges
What is CSS?

CSS allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what CSS, what the basic syntax looks like, and how your browser applies CSS to HTML to style it.

Getting started with CSS

In this article, we will take a simple HTML document and apply CSS to it, learning some practical details of the language along the way. We will also review the CSS syntax features you've not looked at yet.

Styling a biography page Challenge

In this challenge you will style a simple bio page, testing you on some of the skills you learned in the last couple of lessons including writing selectors and text styling.

Basic CSS selectors

In this article we'll recap some selector fundamentals, including the basic type, class, and ID selectors.

Attribute selectors

As you know from your study of HTML, elements can have attributes that give further detail about the element being marked up. In CSS you can use attribute selectors to target elements with certain attributes. This lesson will show you how to use these very useful selectors.

Pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements

The next set of selectors we will look at are referred to as pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements. There are a large number of these, and they often serve quite specific purposes. Once you know how to use them, you can look through the different types to see if there is something which works for the task you are trying to achieve.

Combinators

The final selectors we will look at are called combinators. Combinators are used to combine other selectors in a way that allows us to select elements based on their location in the DOM relative to other elements (for example, child or sibling).

The box model

Everything in CSS has a box around it, and understanding these boxes is key to being able to create more complex layouts with CSS, or to align items with other items. In this lesson, we will take a look at the CSS Box model. You'll get an understanding of how it works and the terminology that relates to it.

Handling conflicts

The aim of this lesson is to develop your understanding of some of the most fundamental concepts of CSS — the cascade, specificity, and inheritance — which control how CSS is applied to HTML and how conflicts between style declarations are resolved.

Values and units

CSS rules contain declarations, which in turn are composed of properties and values. Each property used in CSS has a value type that describes what kind of values it is allowed to have. In this lesson, we will take a look at some of the most frequently used value types, what they are, and how they work.

Sizing items in CSS

Understanding how big the different features in your design will be is important. In this lesson we will summarize the various ways elements get a size via CSS and define a few terms about sizing that will help you in the future.

Backgrounds and borders

In this lesson, we will take a look at some of the creative things you can do with CSS backgrounds and borders. From adding gradients, background images, and rounded corners, backgrounds and borders are the answer to a lot of styling questions in CSS.

Overflowing content

Overflow is what happens when there is too much content to fit inside an element box. In this lesson, you will learn how to manage overflow using CSS.

Images, media, and form elements

In this lesson we will take a look at how certain special elements are treated in CSS. Images, other media, and form elements behave a little differently from regular boxes in terms of your ability to style them with CSS. Understanding what is and isn't possible can save some frustration, and this lesson will highlight some of the main things that you need to know.

Styling tables

Styling an HTML table isn't the most glamorous job in the world, but sometimes we all have to do it. This article explains how to make HTML tables look good, with some specific table styling techniques highlighted.

Debugging CSS

This article will give you guidance on how to go about debugging a CSS problem, and show you how the DevTools included in all modern browsers can help you to find out what is going on.

Challenge: Fundamental CSS comprehension Challenge

This challenge provides a number of related exercises that must be completed in order to create the final design — a business card/gamer card/social media profile.

Challenge: Creating fancy letterheaded paper Challenge

If you want to make the right impression, writing a letter on nice letterheaded paper can be a really good start. In this challenge you will create an online template to achieve such a look.

Challenge: A cool-looking box Challenge

In this challenge, you'll get some more practice in creating cool-looking boxes by trying to create an eye-catching box.

Additional tutorialsThese tutorials are not part of the learning pathway, but they are interesting nonetheless — you should consider these as stretch goals, to optionally study when you are done with the main Core articles.

Advanced styling effects

This article acts as a box of tricks, providing an introduction to some interesting advanced styling features such as box shadows, blend modes, and filters.

Cascade layers

This lesson aims to introduce you to cascade layers, a more advanced feature that builds on the fundamental concepts of the CSS cascade and CSS specificity.

Handling different text directions

In recent years, CSS has evolved in order to better support different directionality of content, including right-to-left but also top-to-bottom content (such as Japanese) — these different directionalities are called writing modes. As you progress in your study and begin to work with layout, an understanding of writing modes will be very helpful to you, therefore we will introduce them in this article.

Organizing CSS

As you start to work on larger stylesheets and big projects you will discover that maintaining a huge CSS file can be challenging. In this article we will take a brief look at some best practices for writing your CSS to make it easily maintainable, and some of the solutions you will find in use by others to help improve maintainability.

Understanding how big the different features in your design will be is important. In this lesson we will summarize the various ways elements get a size via CSS and define a few terms about sizing that will help you in the future.

Backgrounds and borders

In this lesson, we will take a look at some of the creative things you can do with CSS backgrounds and borders. From adding gradients, background images, and rounded corners, backgrounds and borders are the answer to a lot of styling questions in CSS.

Overflowing content

Overflow is what happens when there is too much content to fit inside an element box. In this lesson, you will learn how to manage overflow using CSS.

Images, media, and form elements

In this lesson we will take a look at how certain special elements are treated in CSS. Images, other media, and form elements behave a little differently from regular boxes in terms of your ability to style them with CSS. Understanding what is and isn't possible can save some frustration, and this lesson will highlight some of the main things that you need to know.

Styling tables

Styling an HTML table isn't the most glamorous job in the world, but sometimes we all have to do it. This article explains how to make HTML tables look good, with some specific table styling techniques highlighted.

Debugging CSS

This article will give you guidance on how to go about debugging a CSS problem, and show you how the DevTools included in all modern browsers can help you to find out what is going on.

Challenge: Fundamental CSS comprehension Challenge

This challenge provides a number of related exercises that must be completed in order to create the final design — a business card/gamer card/social media profile.

Challenge: Creating fancy letterheaded paper Challenge

If you want to make the right impression, writing a letter on nice letterheaded paper can be a really good start. In this challenge you will create an online template to achieve such a look.

Challenge: A cool-looking box Challenge

In this challenge, you'll get some more practice in creating cool-looking boxes by trying to create an eye-catching box.

Additional tutorialsThese tutorials are not part of the learning pathway, but they are interesting nonetheless — you should consider these as stretch goals, to optionally study when you are done with the main Core articles.

Advanced styling effects

This article acts as a box of tricks, providing an introduction to some interesting advanced styling features such as box shadows, blend modes, and filters.

Cascade layers

This lesson aims to introduce you to cascade layers, a more advanced feature that builds on the fundamental concepts of the CSS cascade and CSS specificity.

Handling different text directions

In recent years, CSS has evolved in order to better support different directionality of content, including right-to-left but also top-to-bottom content (such as Japanese) — these different directionalities are called writing modes. As you progress in your study and begin to work with layout, an understanding of writing modes will be very helpful to you, therefore we will introduce them in this article.

Organizing CSS

As you start to work on larger stylesheets and big projects you will discover that maintaining a huge CSS file can be challenging. In this article we will take a brief look at some best practices for writing your CSS to make it easily maintainable, and some of the solutions you will find in use by others to help improve maintainability.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages — for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features. This module provides all the CSS fundamentals you'll need for now, including syntax, features, and techniques.PrerequisitesBefore starting this module, you should have a basic work environment set up (as detailed in Installing basic software), and understand how to create and manage files (as detailed in Dealing with files). You should also be familiar with HTML (work through our Structuring content with HTML module if not).

Note:
If you are working on a computer/tablet/other device where you don't have the ability to create your own files, you could try out (most of) the code examples in an online coding program such as JSBin or Glitch.
Tutorials and challenges
What is CSS?

CSS allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what CSS, what the basic syntax looks like, and how your browser applies CSS to HTML to style it.

Getting started with CSS

In this article, we will take a simple HTML document and apply CSS to it, learning some practical details of the language along the way. We will also review the CSS syntax features you've not looked at yet.

Styling a biography page Challenge

In this challenge you will style a simple bio page, testing you on some of the skills you learned in the last couple of lessons including writing selectors and text styling.

Basic CSS selectors

In this article we'll recap some selector fundamentals, including the basic type, class, and ID selectors.

Attribute selectors

As you know from your study of HTML, elements can have attributes that give further detail about the element being marked up. In CSS you can use attribute selectors to target elements with certain attributes. This lesson will show you how to use these very useful selectors.

Pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements

The next set of selectors we will look at are referred to as pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements. There are a large number of these, and they often serve quite specific purposes. Once you know how to use them, you can look through the different types to see if there is something which works for the task you are trying to achieve.

Combinators

The final selectors we will look at are called combinators. Combinators are used to combine other selectors in a way that allows us to select elements based on their location in the DOM relative to other elements (for example, child or sibling).

The box model

Everything in CSS has a box around it, and understanding these boxes is key to being able to create more complex layouts with CSS, or to align items with other items. In this lesson, we will take a look at the CSS Box model. You'll get an understanding of how it works and the terminology that relates to it.

Handling conflicts

The aim of this lesson is to develop your understanding of some of the most fundamental concepts of CSS — the cascade, specificity, and inheritance — which control how CSS is applied to HTML and how conflicts between style declarations are resolved.

Values and units

CSS rules contain declarations, which in turn are composed of properties and values. Each property used in CSS has a value type that describes what kind of values it is allowed to have. In this lesson, we will take a look at some of the most frequently used value types, what they are, and how they work.

Sizing items in CSS

Understanding how big the different features in your design will be is important. In this lesson we will summarize the various ways elements get a size via CSS and define a few terms about sizing that will help you in the future.

Backgrounds and borders

In this lesson, we will take a look at some of the creative things you can do with CSS backgrounds and borders. From adding gradients, background images, and rounded corners, backgrounds and borders are the answer to a lot of styling questions in CSS.

Tutorials and challenges
What is JavaScript?

Welcome to the MDN beginner's JavaScript course! In this first article we will look at JavaScript from a high level, answering questions such as "what is it?", and "what is it doing?", and making sure you are comfortable with JavaScript's purpose.

A first splash into JavaScript

Now you've learned something about the theory of JavaScript, and what you can do with it, we are going to give you a crash course on the basic features of JavaScript via a completely practical tutorial. Here you'll build up a simple "Guess the number" game, step by step.

What went wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript

When you built up the "Guess the number" game in the previous article, you may have found that it didn't work. Never fear — this article aims to save you from tearing your hair out over such problems by providing you with some simple tips on how to find and fix errors in JavaScript programs.

Storing the information you need — Variables

After reading the last couple of articles you should now know what JavaScript is, what it can do for you, how you use it alongside other web technologies, and what its main features look like from a high level. In this article, we will get down to the real basics, looking at how to work with the most basic building blocks of JavaScript — Variables.

Basic math in JavaScript — numbers and operators

At this point in the course, we discuss maths in JavaScript — how we can combine operators and other features to successfully manipulate numbers to do our bidding.

Handling text — strings in JavaScript

Next, we'll turn our attention to strings — this is what pieces of text are called in programming. In this article, we'll look at all the common things that you really ought to know about strings when learning JavaScript, such as creating strings, escaping quotes in strings, and joining them together.

Useful string methods

Now we've looked at the very basics of strings, let's move up a gear and start thinking about what useful operations we can do on strings with built-in methods, such as finding the length of a text string, joining and splitting strings, substituting one character in a string for another, and more.

Arrays

In this lesson we'll look at arrays — a neat way of storing a list of data items under a single variable name. Here we look at why this is useful, then explore how to create an array, retrieve, add, and remove items stored in an array, and more besides.

Challenge: Silly story generator Challenge

In this challenge, you'll be tasked with taking some of the knowledge you've picked up in this module's articles and applying it to creating a fun app that generates random silly stories. Have fun!

Making decisions in your code — conditionals

In any programming language, the code needs to make decisions and carry out actions accordingly depending on different inputs. For example, in a game, if the player's number of lives is 0, then it's game over. In a weather app, if it is being looked at in the morning, show a sunrise graphic; show stars and a moon if it is nighttime. In this article, we'll explore how so-called conditional statements work in JavaScript.

Looping code

Programming languages are very useful for rapidly completing repetitive tasks, from multiple basic calculations to just about any other situation where you've got a lot of similar items of work to complete. Here we'll look at the loop structures available in JavaScript that handle such needs.

Functions — reusable blocks of code

Another essential concept in coding is functions, which allow you to store a piece of code that does a single task inside a defined block, and then call that code whenever you need it using a single short command — rather than having to type out the same code multiple times. In this article we'll explore fundamental concepts behind functions such as basic syntax, how to invoke and define them, scope, and parameters.

Build your own function

With most of the essential theory dealt with in the previous article, this article provides practical experience. Here you will get some practice building your own, custom function. Along the way, we'll also explain some useful details of dealing with functions.

Function return values

There's one last essential concept about functions for us to discuss — return values. Some functions don't return a significant value, but others do. It's important to understand what their values are, how to use them in your code, and how to make functions return useful values. We'll cover all of these below.

Introduction to events

In this article, we discuss some important concepts surrounding events, and look at the fundamentals of how they work in browsers.

Event bubbling

This article introduces the concepts of event bubbling, event capture, and event delegation, which are all about what happens when you add a listener to an element that contains another element, and an event then happens to the contained element.

Challenge: Image gallery Challenge

Now that we've looked at the fundamental building blocks of JavaScript, we'll test your knowledge of loops, functions, conditionals and events by getting you to build a fairly common item you'll see on a lot of websites — a JavaScript-powered image gallery.

Object basics

In this article, we'll look at fundamental JavaScript object syntax, and revisit some JavaScript features that we've already seen earlier in the course, reiterating the fact that many of the features you've already dealt with are objects.

DOM scripting introduction

When writing web pages and apps, one of the most common things you'll want to do is change the document structure in some way. This is usually done by manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) via a set of built-in browser APIs for controlling HTML and styling information. In this article we'll introduce you to DOM scripting.

Making network requests with JavaScript

Another very common task in modern websites and applications is making network requests to retrieve individual data items from the server to update sections of a webpage without having to load an entire new page. This seemingly small detail has had a huge impact on the performance and behavior of sites, so in this article, we'll explain the concept and look at technologies that make it possible.

Working with JSON

JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a standard text-based format for representing structured data based on JavaScript object syntax. It is commonly used for transmitting data in web applications (e.g., sending some data from the server to the client, so it can be displayed on a web page, or vice versa). You'll come across it quite often, so in this article, we give you all you need to work with JSON using JavaScript, including parsing JSON so you can access data within it, and creating JSON.

JavaScript debugging and error handling

In this lesson, we will return to the subject of debugging JavaScript (which we first looked at in What went wrong?). Here we will delve deeper into techniques for tracking down errors, but also look at how to code defensively and handle errors in your code, avoiding problems in the first place.

Tutorials and challenges
What is accessibility?

This article starts off the module with a good look at what accessibility is — this includes what groups of people we need to consider and why, what tools different people use to interact with the web, and how we can make accessibility part of our web development workflow.

Accessibility tooling and assistive technology

Next we turn our attention to accessibility tooling, providing information on the kinds of tools you can use to help solve accessibility issues, and the assistive technologies used by people with disabilities as they browse the web. You'll be using these tools throughout subsequent articles.

HTML: A good basis for accessibility

A great deal of web content can be made accessible just by making sure the correct HTML elements are always used for the correct purpose. This article looks in detail at how HTML can be used to ensure maximum accessibility.

CSS and JavaScript accessibility best practices

CSS and JavaScript, when used properly, also have the potential to allow for accessible web experiences, but if misused they can significantly harm accessibility. This article outlines some CSS and JavaScript best practices that should be considered to ensure that even complex content is as accessible as possible.

WAI-ARIA basics

Following on from the previous article, sometimes making complex UI controls that involve unsemantic HTML and dynamic JavaScript-updated content can be difficult. WAI-ARIA is a technology that can help with such problems by adding in further semantics that browsers and assistive technologies can recognize and use to let users know what is going on. Here we'll show how to use it at a basic level to improve accessibility.

Accessible multimedia

Another category of content that can create accessibility problems is multimedia — video, audio, and image content need to be given proper textual alternatives, so they can be understood by assistive technologies and their users. This article shows how.

Mobile accessibility

With web access on mobile devices being so popular, and popular platforms such as iOS and Android having fully-fledged accessibility tools, it is important to consider the accessibility of your web content on these platforms. This article looks at mobile-specific accessibility considerations.

Accessibility troubleshooting Challenge

In this challenge, we present to you a simple site with several accessibility issues that you need to diagnose and fix.

The service allows users to customize their MDN Web Docs experience through
premium features such as Updates,
Collections and
MDN Offline.Why are we working on premium features on MDN?The extensive research we have done in 2020 and 2021 showed us that MDN users
would appreciate a customized experience on MDN. We’ve got information on what
you would find useful and what you would be interested in. All the premium
features we propose today reflect that feedback. MDN Plus is an initial step
towards making the experience on the site more interactive and helpful for our
users.How much does MDN Plus cost?A three-tiered pricing model has been put in place in order to try and
accommodate our users’ needs as much as possible:

MDN Core - A free plan, for those ones who want to try out a limited version
of the premium features.
MDN Plus 5 - A $5/month or $50/year plan that offers unlimited access to the
premium features included in MDN Plus.
MDN Supporter 10 - A $10/month or $100/year plan for users who want to
support MDN with a higher amount. On top of the MDN Plus premium features, MDN
supporters will be able to contribute and shape the product moving forward, by
having early access to premium features and a direct feedback channel with the
MDN team.

Subscribing for a yearly plan activates a 20% discount for all the paid options.Can I upgrade/downgrade my plan?Currently, you can only upgrade your plan. For getting a downgrade, please
cancel your current subscription first and then activate the new one.What is happening with the existing MDN Web Docs?Nothing. We will continue to develop & maintain our web documentation that will
remain free and accessible for everyone. There will be no change there. Even
more, we believe that MDN Web Docs will benefit from MDN Plus, as we plan to
reinvest part of the gains from MDN Plus and improve our documentation as well
as the overall user experience on the website.Are we violating any OS license obligation by adding a paid product to MDN?MDN content is made available under a CC BY-SA 2.5 license. That license doesn't
preclude Mozilla (or other users of MDN content) from having a paid product. MDN
Plus adds premium features like updates and collections on top of the free
content. Regular users can still access and reuse MDN content under the Creative
Commons license.Where will the money from MDN Plus go?Since its beginning in 2005, MDN Web Docs has been a project hosted and provided
by Mozilla. Mozilla covers the cost of infrastructure, development and
maintenance of the MDN platform, including a team of engineers and its own team
of dedicated writers.
Mozilla wants MDN Plus to help ensure that MDN's open source content continues
to be supported into the future. MDN Plus has been built only with Mozilla
resources, and any revenue generated by MDN Plus will stay within Mozilla. We
are looking into ways to reinvest some of these additional funds into open
source projects contributing to MDN but it is still in the early stages.Does the launch of MDN Plus impact the relationship with partners like OWD?The existence of a new subscription model will not detract from MDN's current
free Web Docs offering in any way. The current experience of accessing web
documentation will not change for users who do not wish to sign up for a premium
subscription. Open Web Docs (OWD) and Mozilla will continue to work closely
together on MDN for the best possible web platform documentation for everyone.
For more information about how our organizations work together, please check
this article.What regions is MDN Plus available in?The free version of MDN Plus is available worldwide. Anyone can create an MDN

Благодаря технологии отправляемых сервером событий (англ. Server-sent events) сервер может отправлять новые данные на веб-страницу в любое время с помощью сообщений.
Внутри веб-страницы такие входящие сообщения можно рассматривать как связку «Событие + данные».

It’s been available across browsers since January 2020.* Some parts of this feature may have varying levels of support.Learn moreSee full compatibilityReport feedbackDeveloping a web application that uses server-sent events is straightforward. You'll need a bit of code on the server to stream events to the front-end, but the client side code works almost identically to websockets in part of handling incoming events. This is a one-way connection, so you can't send events from a client to a server.Receiving events from the serverThe server-sent event API is contained in the EventSource interface.Creating an EventSource instanceTo open a connection to the server to begin receiving events from it, create a new EventSource object with the URL of a script that generates the events. For example:
jsconst evtSource = new EventSource("sse-demo.php");

If the event generator script is hosted on a different origin, a new EventSource object should be created with both the URL and an options dictionary. For example, assuming the client script is on example.com:
jsconst evtSource = new EventSource("//api.example.com/sse-demo.php", {
  withCredentials: true,
});
Listening for message eventsMessages sent from the server that don't have an event field are received as message events. To receive message events, attach a handler for the message event:
jsevtSource.onmessage = (event) => {
  const newElement = document.createElement("li");
  const eventList = document.getElementById("list");

  newElement.textContent = `message: ${event.data}`;
  eventList.appendChild(newElement);
};

This code listens for incoming message events and appends the message text to a list in the document's HTML.Listening for custom eventsMessages from the server that do have an event field defined are received as events with the name given in event. For example:
jsevtSource.addEventListener("ping", (event) => {
  const newElement = document.createElement("li");
  const eventList = document.getElementById("list");
  const time = JSON.parse(event.data).time;
  newElement.textContent = `ping at ${time}`;
  eventList.appendChild(newElement);
});

This code will be called whenever the server sends a message with the event field set to ping; it then parses the JSON in the data field and outputs that information.

Warning:
When not used over HTTP/2, SSE suffers from a limitation to the maximum number of open connections, which can be especially painful when opening multiple tabs, as the limit is per browser and is set to a very low number (6). The issue has been marked as "Won't fix" in Chrome and Firefox. This limit is per browser + domain, which means that you can open 6 SSE connections across all of the tabs to www.example1.com and another 6 SSE connections to www.example2.com (per Stack Overflow). When using HTTP/2, the maximum number of simultaneous HTTP streams is negotiated between the server and the client (defaults to 100).
Sending events from the serverThe server-side script that sends events needs to respond using the MIME type text/event-stream. Each notification is sent as a block of text terminated by a pair of newlines. For details on the format of the event stream, see Event stream format.
The PHP code for the example we're using here follows:
phpdate_default_timezone_set("America/New_York");
header("X-Accel-Buffering: no");
header("Content-Type: text/event-stream");
header("Cache-Control: no-cache");

$counter = rand(1, 10);
while (true) {
  // Every second, send a "ping" event.

  echo "event: ping\n";
  $curDate = date(DATE_ISO8601);
  echo 'data: {"time": "' . $curDate . '"}';
  echo "\n\n";

  // Send a simple message at random intervals.

  $counter--;

  if (!$counter) {
    echo 'data: This is a message at time ' . $curDate . "\n\n";
    $counter = rand(1, 10);
  }

  if (ob_get_contents()) {
      ob_end_flush();
  }
  flush();

  // Break the loop if the client aborted the connection (closed the page)

  if (connection_aborted()) break;

  sleep(1);
}

The code above generates an event every second, with the event type "ping". Each event's data is a JSON object containing the ISO 8601 timestamp corresponding to the time at which the event was generated. At random intervals, a simple message (with no event type) is sent.
The loop will keep running independent of the connection status, so a check is included
to break the loop if the connection has been closed (e.g., client closes the page).

Note:
You can find a full example that uses the code shown in this article on GitHub — see Simple SSE demo using PHP.
Error handlingWhen problems occur (such as a network timeout or issues pertaining to access control), an error event is generated. You can take action on this programmatically by implementing the onerror callback on the EventSource object:
jsevtSource.onerror = (err) => {
  console.error("EventSource failed:", err);
};
Closing event streamsBy default, if the connection between the client and server closes, the connection is restarted. The connection is terminated with the .close() method.
jsevtSource.close();
Event stream formatThe event stream is a simple stream of text data which must be encoded using UTF-8. Messages in the event stream are separated by a pair of newline characters. A colon as the first character of a line is in essence a comment, and is ignored.

Note:
The comment line can be used to prevent connections from timing out; a server can send a comment periodically to keep the connection alive.

Each message consists of one or more lines of text listing the fields for that message. Each field is represented by the field name, followed by a colon, followed by the text data for that field's value.FieldsEach message received has some combination of the following fields, one per line:

event

A string identifying the type of event described. If this is specified, an event will be dispatched on the browser to the listener for the specified event name; the website source code should use addEventListener() to listen for named events. The onmessage handler is called if no event name is specified for a message.

data

The data field for the message. When the EventSource receives multiple consecutive lines that begin with data:, it concatenates them, inserting a newline character between each one. Trailing newlines are removed.

id

The event ID to set the EventSource object's last event ID value.

retry

The reconnection time. If the connection to the server is lost, the browser will wait for the specified time before attempting to reconnect. This must be an integer, specifying the reconnection time in milliseconds. If a non-integer value is specified, the field is ignored.


All other field names are ignored.

Note:
If a line doesn't contain a colon, the entire line is treated as the field name with an empty value string.
ExamplesData-only messages
In the following example, there are three messages sent. The first is just a comment, since it starts with a colon character. As mentioned previously, this can be useful as a keep-alive mechanism if messages might not be sent regularly.
The second message contains a data field with the value "some text". The third message contains a data field with the value "another message\nwith two lines". Note the newline special character in the value.
bash: this is a test stream

data: some text

data: another message
data: with two lines

Named events
This example sends named events. Each has an event name specified by the event field, and a data field whose value is an appropriate JSON string with the data needed for the client to act on the event. The data field could, of course, have any string data; it doesn't have to be JSON.
bashevent: userconnect
data: {"username": "bobby", "time": "02:33:48"}

event: usermessage
data: {"username": "bobby", "time": "02:34:11", "text": "Hi everyone."}

event: userdisconnect
data: {"username": "bobby", "time": "02:34:23"}

event: usermessage
data: {"username": "sean", "time": "02:34:36", "text": "Bye, bobby."}

Mixing and matching
You don't have to use just unnamed messages or typed events; you can mix them together in a single event stream.
bashevent: userconnect
data: {"username": "bobby", "time": "02:33:48"}

data: Here's a system message of some kind that will get used
data: to accomplish some task.

event: usermessage
data: {"username": "bobby", "time": "02:34:11", "text": "Hi everyone."}

You'll need a bit of code on the server to stream events to the front-end, but the client side code works almost identically to websockets in part of handling incoming events. This is a one-way connection, so you can't send events from a client to a server.Receiving events from the serverThe server-sent event API is contained in the EventSource interface.Creating an EventSource instanceTo open a connection to the server to begin receiving events from it, create a new EventSource object with the URL of a script that generates the events. For example:
jsconst evtSource = new EventSource("sse-demo.php");

If the event generator script is hosted on a different origin, a new EventSource object should be created with both the URL and an options dictionary. For example, assuming the client script is on example.com:
jsconst evtSource = new EventSource("//api.example.com/sse-demo.php", {
  withCredentials: true,
});

The EventSource interface is web content's interface to server-sent events.
An EventSource instance opens a persistent connection to an HTTP server, which sends events in text/event-stream format. The connection remains open until closed by calling EventSource.close().

Once the connection is opened, incoming messages from the server are delivered to your code in the form of events. If there is an event field in the incoming message, the triggered event is the same as the event field value. If no event field is present, then a generic message event is fired.
Unlike WebSockets, server-sent events are unidirectional; that is, data messages are delivered in one direction, from the server to the client (such as a user's web browser). That makes them an excellent choice when there's no need to send data from the client to the server in message form. For example, EventSource is a useful approach for handling things like social media status updates, news feeds, or delivering data into a client-side storage mechanism like IndexedDB or web storage.

Warning:
When not used over HTTP/2, SSE suffers from a limitation to the maximum number of open connections, which can be specially painful when opening various tabs as the limit is per browser and set to a very low number (6).

Constructor
EventSource()

Creates a new EventSource to handle receiving server-sent events from a specified URL, optionally in credentials mode.

Instance propertiesThis interface also inherits properties from its parent, EventTarget.

EventSource.readyState Read only

A number representing the state of the connection. Possible values are CONNECTING (0), OPEN (1), or CLOSED (2).

EventSource.url Read only

A string representing the URL of the source.

EventSource.withCredentials Read only

A boolean value indicating whether the EventSource object was instantiated with cross-origin (CORS) credentials set (true), or not (false, the default).

Instance methodsThis interface also inherits methods from its parent, EventTarget.

EventSource.close()

Closes the connection, if any, and sets the readyState attribute to CLOSED. If the connection is already closed, the method does nothing.

Events
error

Fired when a connection to an event source failed to open.

message

Fired when data is received from an event source.

open

Fired when a connection to an event source has opened.


Additionally, the event source itself may send messages with an event field, which will create ad hoc events keyed to that value.ExamplesIn this basic example, an EventSource is created to receive unnamed events from the server; a page with the name sse.php is responsible for generating the events.
jsconst evtSource = new EventSource("sse.php");
const eventList = document.querySelector("ul");

evtSource.onmessage = (e) => {
  const newElement = document.createElement("li");

  newElement.textContent = `message: ${e.data}`;
  eventList.appendChild(newElement);
};

Each received event causes our EventSource object's onmessage event handler to be run. It, in turn, creates a new <li> element and writes the message's data into it, then appends the new element to the list element already in the document.

Note:
You can find a full example on GitHub — see Simple SSE demo using PHP.

To listen to named events, you'll require a listener for each type of event sent.
jsconst sse = new EventSource("/api/v1/sse");

/*
 * This will listen only for events
 * similar to the following:
 *
 * event: notice
 * data: useful data
 * id: some-id
 */
sse.addEventListener("notice", (e) => {
  console.log(e.data);
});

/*
 * Similarly, this will listen for events
 * with the field `event: update`
 */
sse.addEventListener("update", (e) => {
  console.log(e.data);
});

/*
 * The event "message" is a special case, as it
 * will capture events without an event field
 * as well as events that have the specific type
 * `event: message` It will not trigger on any
 * other event type.
 */
sse.addEventListener("message", (e) => {
  console.log(e.data);
});

Creates a new EventSource to handle receiving server-sent events from a specified URL, optionally in credentials mode.

Instance propertiesThis interface also inherits properties from its parent, EventTarget.

EventSource.readyState Read only

A number representing the state of the connection. Possible values are CONNECTING (0), OPEN (1), or CLOSED (2).

EventSource.url Read only

A string representing the URL of the source.

EventSource.withCredentials Read only

A boolean value indicating whether the EventSource object was instantiated with cross-origin (CORS) credentials set (true), or not (false, the default).

Instance methodsThis interface also inherits methods from its parent, EventTarget.

EventSource.close()

Closes the connection, if any, and sets the readyState attribute to CLOSED. If the connection is already closed, the method does nothing.

Events
error

Fired when a connection to an event source failed to open.

message

Fired when data is received from an event source.

open

Fired when a connection to an event source has opened.


Additionally, the event source itself may send messages with an event field, which will create ad hoc events keyed to that value.ExamplesIn this basic example, an EventSource is created to receive unnamed events from the server; a page with the name sse.php is responsible for generating the events.
jsconst evtSource = new EventSource("sse.php");
const eventList = document.querySelector("ul");

evtSource.onmessage = (e) => {
  const newElement = document.createElement("li");

  newElement.textContent = `message: ${e.data}`;
  eventList.appendChild(newElement);
};

Each received event causes our EventSource object's onmessage event handler to be run. It, in turn, creates a new <li> element and writes the message's data into it, then appends the new element to the list element already in the document.

Note:
You can find a full example on GitHub — see Simple SSE demo using PHP.

To listen to named events, you'll require a listener for each type of event sent.
jsconst sse = new EventSource("/api/v1/sse");

/*
 * This will listen only for events
 * similar to the following:
 *
 * event: notice
 * data: useful data
 * id: some-id
 */
sse.addEventListener("notice", (e) => {
  console.log(e.data);
});

/*
 * Similarly, this will listen for events
 * with the field `event: update`
 */
sse.addEventListener("update", (e) => {
  console.log(e.data);
});

/*
 * The event "message" is a special case, as it
 * will capture events without an event field
 * as well as events that have the specific type
 * `event: message` It will not trigger on any
 * other event type.
 */
sse.addEventListener("message", (e) => {
  console.log(e.data);
});

The EventSource interface is web content's interface to server-sent events.
An EventSource instance opens a persistent connection to an HTTP server, which sends events in text/event-stream format. The connection remains open until closed by calling EventSource.close().

Once the connection is opened, incoming messages from the server are delivered to your code in the form of events. If there is an event field in the incoming message, the triggered event is the same as the event field value. If no event field is present, then a generic message event is fired.
Unlike WebSockets, server-sent events are unidirectional; that is, data messages are delivered in one direction, from the server to the client (such as a user's web browser). That makes them an excellent choice when there's no need to send data from the client to the server in message form. For example, EventSource is a useful approach for handling things like social media status updates, news feeds, or delivering data into a client-side storage mechanism like IndexedDB or web storage.

Warning:
When not used over HTTP/2, SSE suffers from a limitation to the maximum number of open connections, which can be specially painful when opening various tabs as the limit is per browser and set to a very low number (6). The issue has been marked as "Won't fix" in Chrome and Firefox. This limit is per browser + domain, so that means that you can open 6 SSE connections across all of the tabs to www.example1.com and another 6 SSE connections to www.example2.com. (from Stack Overflow). When using HTTP/2, the maximum number of simultaneous HTTP streams is negotiated between the server and the client (defaults to 100).

The advantage of this is that laborious processing can be performed in a separate thread, allowing the main (usually the UI) thread to run without being blocked/slowed down.Concepts and usageA worker is an object created using a constructor (e.g., Worker()) that runs a named JavaScript file — this file contains the code that will run in the worker thread.
In addition to the standard JavaScript set of functions (such as String, Array, Object, JSON, etc.), you can run almost any code you like inside a worker thread. There are some exceptions: for example, you can't directly manipulate the DOM from inside a worker, or use some default methods and properties of the Window object. For information about the code that you can run see supported functions, and supported Web APIs.
Data is sent between workers and the main thread via a system of messages — both sides send their messages using the postMessage() method, and respond to messages via the onmessage event handler (the message is contained within the message event's data property). The data is copied rather than shared.
Workers may in turn spawn new workers, as long as those workers are hosted within the same origin as the parent page.
In addition, workers can make network requests using the fetch() or XMLHttpRequest APIs (although note that the responseXML attribute of XMLHttpRequest will always be null).Worker typesThere are a number of different types of workers:

Dedicated workers are workers that are utilized by a single script. This context is represented by a DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope object.
Shared workers are workers that can be utilized by multiple scripts running in different windows, IFrames, etc., as long as they are in the same domain as the worker. They are a little more complex than dedicated workers — scripts must communicate via an active port.
Service Workers essentially act as proxy servers that sit between web applications, the browser, and the network (when available). They are intended, among other things, to enable the creation of effective offline experiences, intercept network requests and take appropriate action based on whether the network is available, and update assets residing on the server. They will also allow access to push notifications and background sync APIs.
Worker contextsWhile Window is not directly available to workers, many of the same methods are defined in a shared mixin (WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope), and made available to workers through their own WorkerGlobalScope-derived contexts:

DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope for dedicated workers
SharedWorkerGlobalScope for shared workers
ServiceWorkerGlobalScope for service workers
Interfaces
Worker

Represents a running worker thread, allowing you to pass messages to the running worker code.

WorkerLocation

Defines the absolute location of the script executed by the Worker.

SharedWorker

Represents a specific kind of worker that can be accessed from several browsing contexts (i.e., windows, tabs, or iframes) or even other workers.

WorkerGlobalScope

Represents the generic scope of any worker (doing the same job as Window does for normal web content). Different types of worker have scope objects that inherit from this interface and add more specific features.

DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope

Represents the scope of a dedicated worker, inheriting from WorkerGlobalScope and adding some dedicated features.

SharedWorkerGlobalScope

Represents the scope of a shared worker, inheriting from WorkerGlobalScope and adding some dedicated features.

WorkerNavigator

Represents the identity and state of the user agent (the client).

The Event interface represents an event which takes place on an EventTarget.
An event can be triggered by the user action e.g., clicking the mouse button or tapping keyboard, or generated by APIs to represent the progress of an asynchronous task. It can also be triggered programmatically, such as by calling the HTMLElement.click() method of an element, or by defining the event, then sending it to a specified target using EventTarget.dispatchEvent().
There are many types of events, some of which use other interfaces based on the main Event interface. Event itself contains the properties and methods which are common to all events.
Many DOM elements can be set up to accept (or "listen" for) these events, and execute code in response to process (or "handle") them. Event-handlers are usually connected (or "attached") to various HTML elements (such as <button>, <div>, <span>, etc.) using EventTarget.addEventListener(), and this generally replaces using the old HTML event handler attributes. Further, when properly added, such handlers can also be disconnected if needed using removeEventListener().

Note:
One element can have several such handlers, even for the exact same event—particularly if separate, independent code modules attach them, each for its own independent purposes. (For example, a webpage with an advertising-module and statistics-module both monitoring video-watching.)

When there are many nested elements, each with its own handler(s), event processing can become very complicated—especially where a parent element receives the very same event as its child elements because "spatially" they overlap so the event technically occurs in both, and the processing order of such events depends on the Event bubbling settings of each handler triggered.Interfaces based on EventBelow is a list of interfaces which are based on the main Event interface, with links to their respective documentation in the MDN API reference.
Note that all event interfaces have names which end in "Event".

Instance properties
Event.bubbles Read only

A boolean value indicating whether or not the event bubbles up through the DOM.

Event.cancelable Read only

A boolean value indicating whether the event is cancelable.

Event.composed Read only

A boolean indicating whether or not the event can bubble across the boundary between the shadow DOM and the regular DOM.

Event.currentTarget Read only

A reference to the currently registered target for the event. This is the object to which the event is currently slated to be sent. It's possible this has been changed along the way through retargeting.

Event.defaultPrevented Read only

Indicates whether or not the call to event.preventDefault() canceled the event.

Event.eventPhase Read only

Indicates which phase of the event flow is being processed. It is one of the following numbers: NONE, CAPTURING_PHASE, AT_TARGET, BUBBLING_PHASE.

Event.isTrusted Read only

Indicates whether or not the event was initiated by the browser (after a user click, for instance) or by a script (using an event creation method, for example).

Event.srcElement Read only 
Deprecated


An alias for the Event.target property. Use Event.target instead.

Event.target Read only

Event.type Read only

The name identifying the type of the event.

Legacy and non-standard properties
Event.cancelBubble 
Deprecated


A historical alias to Event.stopPropagation() that should be used instead. Setting its value to true before returning from an event handler prevents propagation of the event.

Event.explicitOriginalTarget 
Non-standard

The explicit original target of the event.

Event.originalTarget

The original target of the event, before any retargetings.

Event.returnValue 
Deprecated


A historical property still supported in order to ensure existing sites continue to work. Use Event.preventDefault() and Event.defaultPrevented instead.

Event.scoped Read only 
Deprecated


A boolean value indicating whether the given event will bubble across through the shadow root into the standard DOM. Use composed instead.

Instance methods
Event.composedPath()

Returns the event's path (an array of objects on which listeners will be invoked). This does not include nodes in shadow trees if the shadow root was created with its ShadowRoot.mode closed.

Event.preventDefault()

Cancels the event (if it is cancelable).

Event.stopImmediatePropagation()

For this particular event, prevent all other listeners from being called. This includes listeners attached to the same element as well as those attached to elements that will be traversed later (during the capture phase, for instance).

Event.stopPropagation()

Stops the propagation of events further along in the DOM.

Deprecated methods
Event.initEvent() 
Deprecated


Initializes the value of an Event created. If the event has already been dispatched, this method does nothing. Use the constructor (Event() instead).

When there are many nested elements, each with its own handler(s), event processing can become very complicated—especially where a parent element receives the very same event as its child elements because "spatially" they overlap so the event technically occurs in both, and the processing order of such events depends on the Event bubbling settings of each handler triggered.Interfaces based on EventBelow is a list of interfaces which are based on the main Event interface, with links to their respective documentation in the MDN API reference.
Note that all event interfaces have names which end in "Event".

Constructor
Event()

Creates an Event object, returning it to the caller.

Instance properties
Event.bubbles Read only

A boolean value indicating whether or not the event bubbles up through the DOM.

Event.cancelable Read only

A boolean value indicating whether the event is cancelable.

Event.composed Read only

A boolean indicating whether or not the event can bubble across the boundary between the shadow DOM and the regular DOM.

Event.currentTarget Read only

A reference to the currently registered target for the event. This is the object to which the event is currently slated to be sent. It's possible this has been changed along the way through retargeting.

Event.defaultPrevented Read only

Indicates whether or not the call to event.preventDefault() canceled the event.

Event.eventPhase Read only

Indicates which phase of the event flow is being processed. It is one of the following numbers: NONE, CAPTURING_PHASE, AT_TARGET, BUBBLING_PHASE.

Event.isTrusted Read only

Indicates whether or not the event was initiated by the browser (after a user click, for instance) or by a script (using an event creation method, for example).

Event.srcElement Read only 
Deprecated


An alias for the Event.target property. Use Event.target instead.

Event.target Read only

A reference to the object to which the event was originally dispatched.

Event.timeStamp Read only

The time at which the event was created (in milliseconds). By specification, this value is time since epoch—but in reality, browsers' definitions vary. In addition, work is underway to change this to be a DOMHighResTimeStamp instead.

Event.type Read only

The name identifying the type of the event.

Legacy and non-standard properties
Event.cancelBubble 
Deprecated


A historical alias to Event.stopPropagation() that should be used instead. Setting its value to true before returning from an event handler prevents propagation of the event.

Event.explicitOriginalTarget 
Non-standard
 Read only

The explicit original target of the event.

Event.originalTarget 
Non-standard
 Read only

The original target of the event, before any retargetings.

Event.returnValue 
Deprecated


A historical property still supported in order to ensure existing sites continue to work. Use Event.preventDefault() and Event.defaultPrevented instead.

Event.scoped Read only 
Deprecated


A boolean value indicating whether the given event will bubble across through the shadow root into the standard DOM. Use composed instead.

Instance methods
Event.composedPath()

Returns the event's path (an array of objects on which listeners will be invoked). This does not include nodes in shadow trees if the shadow root was created with its ShadowRoot.mode closed.

Event.preventDefault()

Cancels the event (if it is cancelable).

Event.stopImmediatePropagation()

For this particular event, prevent all other listeners from being called. This includes listeners attached to the same element as well as those attached to elements that will be traversed later (during the capture phase, for instance).

Event.stopPropagation()

Stops the propagation of events further along in the DOM.

Deprecated methods
Event.initEvent() 
Deprecated


Initializes the value of an Event created. If the event has already been dispatched, this method does nothing. Use the constructor (Event() instead).

Another very common task in modern websites and applications is making network requests to retrieve individual data items from the server to update sections of a webpage without having to load an entire new page.

What is the problem here?A web page consists of an HTML page and (usually) various other files, such as stylesheets, scripts, and images. The basic model of page loading on the Web is that your browser makes one or more HTTP requests to the server for the files needed to display the page, and the server responds with the requested files. If you visit another page, the browser requests the new files, and the server responds with them.

This model works perfectly well for many sites. But consider a website that's very data-driven. For example, a library website like the Vancouver Public Library. Among other things you could think of a site like this as a user interface to a database. It might let you search for a particular genre of book, or might show you recommendations for books you might like, based on books you've previously borrowed. When you do this, it needs to update the page with the new set of books to display. But note that most of the page content — including items like the page header, sidebar, and footer — stays the same.
The trouble with the traditional model here is that we'd have to fetch and load the entire page, even when we only need to update one part of it. This is inefficient and can result in a poor user experience.
So instead of the traditional model, many websites use JavaScript APIs to request data from the server and update the page content without a page load. So when the user searches for a new product, the browser only requests the data which is needed to update the page — the set of new books to display, for instance.

The main API here is the Fetch API. This enables JavaScript running in a page to make an HTTP request to a server to retrieve specific resources. When the server provides them, the JavaScript can use the data to update the page, typically by using DOM manipulation APIs. The data requested is often JSON, which is a good format for transferring structured data, but can also be HTML or just text.
This is a common pattern for data-driven sites such as Amazon, YouTube, eBay, and so on. With this model:

Page updates are a lot quicker and you don't have to wait for the page to refresh, meaning that the site feels faster and more responsive.
Less data is downloaded on each update, meaning less wasted bandwidth. This may not be such a big issue on a desktop on a broadband connection, but it's a major issue on mobile devices and in countries that don't have ubiquitous fast internet service.


Note:
In the early days, this general technique was known as Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX), because it tended to request XML data. This is normally not the case these days (you'd be more likely to request JSON), but the result is still the same, and the term "AJAX" is still often used to describe the technique.

To speed things up even further, some sites also store assets and data on the user's computer when they are first requested, meaning that on subsequent visits they use the local versions instead of downloading fresh copies every time the page is first loaded. The content is only reloaded from the server when it has been updated.The Fetch APILet's walk through a couple of examples of the Fetch API.Fetching text contentFor this example, we'll request data out of a few different text files and use them to populate a content area.
This series of files will act as our fake database; in a real application, we'd be more likely to use a server-side language like PHP, Python, or Node to request our data from a database. Here, however, we want to keep it simple and concentrate on the client-side part of this.
To begin this example, make a local copy of fetch-start.html and the four text files — verse1.txt, verse2.txt, verse3.txt, and verse4.txt — in a new directory on your computer. In this example, we will fetch a different verse of the poem (which you may well recognize) when it's selected in the drop-down menu.
Just inside the <script> element, add the following code. This stores references to the <select> and <pre> elements and adds a listener to the <select> element, so that when the user selects a new value, the new value is passed to the function named updateDisplay() as a parameter.
jsconst verseChoose = document.querySelector("select");
const poemDisplay = document.querySelector("pre");

verseChoose.addEventListener("change", () => {
  const verse = verseChoose.value;
  updateDisplay(verse);
});

Let's define our updateDisplay() function. First of all, put the following beneath your previous code block — this is the empty shell of the function.
jsfunction updateDisplay(verse) {

}

We'll start our function by constructing a relative URL pointing to the text file we want to load, as we'll need it later. The value of the <select> element at any time is the same as the text inside the selected <option> (unless you specify a different value in a value attribute) — so for example "Verse 1". The corresponding verse text file is "verse1.txt", and is in the same directory as the HTML file, therefore just the file name will do.
However, web servers tend to be case-sensitive, and the file name doesn't have a space in it. To convert "Verse 1" to "verse1.txt" we need to convert the 'V' to lower case, remove the space, and add ".txt" on the end. This can be done with replace(), toLowerCase(), and template literal. Add the following lines inside your updateDisplay() function:
jsverse = verse.replace(" ", "").toLowerCase();
const url = `${verse}.txt`;

Finally we're ready to use the Fetch API:
js// Call `fetch()`, passing in the URL.
fetch(url)
  // fetch() returns a promise. When we have received a response from the server,
  // the promise's `then()` handler is called with the response.
  .then((response) => {
    // Our handler throws an error if the request did not succeed.
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP error: ${response.status}`);
    }
    // Otherwise (if the response succeeded), our handler fetches the response
    // as text by calling response.text(), and immediately returns the promise
    // returned by `response.text()`.
    return response.text();
  })
  // When response.text() has succeeded, the `then()` handler is called with
  // the text, and we copy it into the `poemDisplay` box.
  .then((text) => {
    poemDisplay.textContent = text;
  })
  // Catch any errors that might happen, and display a message
  // in the `poemDisplay` box.
  .catch((error) => {
    poemDisplay.textContent = `Could not fetch verse: ${error}`;
  });

There's quite a lot to unpack in here.
First, the entry point to the Fetch API is a global function called fetch(), that takes the URL as a parameter (it takes another optional parameter for custom settings, but we're not using that here).
Next, fetch() is an asynchronous API which returns a Promise. If you don't know what that is, read the module on asynchronous JavaScript, and in particular the lesson on promises, then come back here. You'll find that article also talks about the fetch() API!
So because fetch() returns a promise, we pass a function into the then() method of the returned promise. This method will be called when the HTTP request has received a response from the server. In the handler, we check that the request succeeded, and throw an error if it didn't. Otherwise, we call response.text(), to get the response body as text.
It turns out that response.text() is also asynchronous, so we return the promise it returns, and pass a function into the then() method of this new promise. This function will be called when the response text is ready, and inside it we will update our <pre> block with the text.
Finally, we chain a catch() handler at the end, to catch any errors thrown in either of the asynchronous functions we called or their handlers.
One problem with the example as it stands is that it won't show any of the poem when it first loads. To fix this, add the following two lines at the bottom of your code (just above the closing </script> tag) to load verse 1 by default, and make sure the <select> element always shows the correct value:
jsupdateDisplay("Verse 1");
verseChoose.value = "Verse 1";

Serving your example from a server
Modern browsers will not run HTTP requests if you just run the example from a local file. This is because of security restrictions (for more on web security, read Website security).
To get around this, we need to test the example by running it through a local web server. To find out how to do this, see How do you set up a local testing server?.The can storeIn this example we have created a sample site called The Can Store — it's a fictional supermarket that only sells canned goods. You can find this example live on GitHub, and see the source code.

By default, the site displays all the products, but you can use the form controls in the left-hand column to filter them by category, or search term, or both.
There is quite a lot of complex code that deals with filtering the products by category and search terms, manipulating strings so the data displays correctly in the UI, etc. We won't discuss all of it in the article, but you can find extensive comments in the code (see can-script.js).
We will, however, explain the Fetch code.
The first block that uses Fetch can be found at the start of the JavaScript:
jsfetch("products.json")
  .then((response) => {
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP error: ${response.status}`);
    }
    return response.json();
  })
  .then((json) => initialize(json))
  .catch((err) => console.error(`Fetch problem: ${err.message}`));

The fetch() function returns a promise. If this completes successfully, the function inside the first .then() block contains the response returned from the network.
Inside this function we:

check that the server didn't return an error (such as 404 Not Found). If it did, we throw the error.
call json() on the response. This will retrieve the data as a JSON object. We return the promise returned by response.json().

Next we pass a function into the then() method of that returned promise. This function will be passed an object containing the response data as JSON, which we pass into the initialize() function. It is initialize() which starts the process of displaying all the products in the user interface.
To handle errors, we chain a .catch() block onto the end of the chain. This runs if the promise fails for some reason. Inside it, we include a function that is passed as a parameter, an err object. This err object can be used to report the nature of the error that has occurred, in this case we do it with a simple console.error().
However, a complete website would handle this error more gracefully by displaying a message on the user's screen and perhaps offering options to remedy the situation, but we don't need anything more than a simple console.error().
You can test the failure case yourself:


Make a local copy of the example files.
Run the code through a web server (as described above, in Serving your example from a server).
Modify the path to the file being fetched, to something like 'produc.json' (make sure it is misspelled).
Now load the index file in your browser (via localhost:8000) and look in your browser developer console. You'll see a message similar to "Fetch problem: HTTP error: 404".

The second Fetch block can be found inside the fetchBlob() function:
jsfetch(url)
  .then((response) => {
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP error: ${response.status}`);
    }
    return response.blob();
  })
  .then((blob) => showProduct(blob, product))
  .catch((err) => console.error(`Fetch problem: ${err.message}`));

This works in much the same way as the previous one, except that instead of using json(), we use blob(). In this case we want to return our response as an image file, and the data format we use for that is Blob (the term is an abbreviation of "Binary Large Object" and can basically be used to represent large file-like objects, such as images or video files).
Once we've successfully received our blob, we pass it into our showProduct() function, which displays it.The XMLHttpRequest APISometimes, especially in older code, you'll see another API called XMLHttpRequest (often abbreviated as "XHR") used to make HTTP requests. This predated Fetch, and was really the first API widely used to implement AJAX. We recommend you use Fetch if you can: it's a simpler API and has more features than XMLHttpRequest. We won't go through an example that uses XMLHttpRequest, but we will show you what the XMLHttpRequest version of our first can store request would look like:
jsconst request = new XMLHttpRequest();

try {
  request.open("GET", "products.json");

  request.responseType = "json";

  request.addEventListener("load", () => initialize(request.response));
  request.addEventListener("error", () => console.error("XHR error"));

  request.send();
} catch (error) {
  console.error(`XHR error ${request.status}`);
}

There are five stages to this:

Create a new XMLHttpRequest object.
Call its open() method to initialize it.
Add an event listener to its load event, which fires when the response has completed successfully. In the listener we call initialize() with the data.
Add an event listener to its error event, which fires when the request encounters an error
Send the request.

We also have to wrap the whole thing in the try...catch block, to handle any errors thrown by open() or send().
Hopefully you think the Fetch API is an improvement over this. In particular, see how we have to handle errors in two different places.SummaryThis article shows how to start working with Fetch to fetch data from the server.See alsoThere are however a lot of different subjects discussed in this article, which has only really scratched the surface.

To begin this example, make a local copy of fetch-start.html and the four text files — verse1.txt, verse2.txt, verse3.txt, and verse4.txt — in a new directory on your computer. In this example, we will fetch a different verse of the poem (which you may well recognize) when it's selected in the drop-down menu.
Just inside the <script> element, add the following code. This stores references to the <select> and <pre> elements and adds a listener to the <select> element, so that when the user selects a new value, the new value is passed to the function named updateDisplay() as a parameter.
jsconst verseChoose = document.querySelector("select");
const poemDisplay = document.querySelector("pre");

verseChoose.addEventListener("change", () => {
  const verse = verseChoose.value;
  updateDisplay(verse);
});

Let's define our updateDisplay() function. First of all, put the following beneath your previous code block — this is the empty shell of the function.
jsfunction updateDisplay(verse) {

}

We'll start our function by constructing a relative URL pointing to the text file we want to load, as we'll need it later. The value of the <select> element at any time is the same as the text inside the selected <option> (unless you specify a different value in a value attribute) — so for example "Verse 1". The corresponding verse text file is "verse1.txt", and is in the same directory as the HTML file, therefore just the file name will do.
However, web servers tend to be case-sensitive, and the file name doesn't have a space in it. To convert "Verse 1" to "verse1.txt" we need to convert the 'V' to lower case, remove the space, and add ".txt" on the end. This can be done with replace(), toLowerCase(), and template literal. Add the following lines inside your updateDisplay() function:
jsverse = verse.replace(" ", "").toLowerCase();
const url = `${verse}.txt`;

Finally we're ready to use the Fetch API:
js// Call `fetch()`, passing in the URL.
fetch(url)
  // fetch() returns a promise. When we have received a response from the server,
  // the promise's `then()` handler is called with the response.
  .then((response) => {
    // Our handler throws an error if the request did not succeed.
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP error: ${response.status}`);
    }
    // Otherwise (if the response succeeded), our handler fetches the response
    // as text by calling response.text(), and immediately returns the promise
    // returned by `response.text()`.
    return response.text();
  })
  // When response.text() has succeeded, the `then()` handler is called with
  // the text, and we copy it into the `poemDisplay` box.
  .then((text) => {
    poemDisplay.textContent = text;
  })
  // Catch any errors that might happen, and display a message
  // in the `poemDisplay` box.
  .catch((error) => {
    poemDisplay.textContent = `Could not fetch verse: ${error}`;
  });

There's quite a lot to unpack in here.
First, the entry point to the Fetch API is a global function called fetch(), that takes the URL as a parameter (it takes another optional parameter for custom settings, but we're not using that here).
Next, fetch() is an asynchronous API which returns a Promise. If you don't know what that is, read the module on asynchronous JavaScript, and in particular the lesson on promises, then come back here. You'll find that article also talks about the fetch() API!
So because fetch() returns a promise, we pass a function into the then() method of the returned promise. This method will be called when the HTTP request has received a response from the server. In the handler, we check that the request succeeded, and throw an error if it didn't. Otherwise, we call response.text(), to get the response body as text.
It turns out that response.text() is also asynchronous, so we return the promise it returns, and pass a function into the then() method of this new promise. This function will be called when the response text is ready, and inside it we will update our <pre> block with the text.
Finally, we chain a catch() handler at the end, to catch any errors thrown in either of the asynchronous functions we called or their handlers.
One problem with the example as it stands is that it won't show any of the poem when it first loads. To fix this, add the following two lines at the bottom of your code (just above the closing </script> tag) to load verse 1 by default, and make sure the <select> element always shows the correct value:
jsupdateDisplay("Verse 1");
verseChoose.value = "Verse 1";

Serving your example from a server
Modern browsers will not run HTTP requests if you just run the example from a local file. This is because of security restrictions (for more on web security, read Website security).
To get around this, we need to test the example by running it through a local web server. To find out how to do this, see How do you set up a local testing server?.The can storeIn this example we have created a sample site called The Can Store — it's a fictional supermarket that only sells canned goods. You can find this example live on GitHub, and see the source code.

By default, the site displays all the products, but you can use the form controls in the left-hand column to filter them by category, or search term, or both.
There is quite a lot of complex code that deals with filtering the products by category and search terms, manipulating strings so the data displays correctly in the UI, etc. We won't discuss all of it in the article, but you can find extensive comments in the code (see can-script.js).
We will, however, explain the Fetch code.
The first block that uses Fetch can be found at the start of the JavaScript:
jsfetch("products.json")
  .then((response) => {
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP error: ${response.status}`);
    }
    return response.json();
  })
  .then((json) => initialize(json))
  .catch((err) => console.error(`Fetch problem: ${err.message}`));

The fetch() function returns a promise. If this completes successfully, the function inside the first .then() block contains the response returned from the network.
Inside this function we:

check that the server didn't return an error (such as 404 Not Found). If it did, we throw the error.
call json() on the response. This will retrieve the data as a JSON object. We return the promise returned by response.json().

Next we pass a function into the then() method of that returned promise. This function will be passed an object containing the response data as JSON, which we pass into the initialize() function. It is initialize() which starts the process of displaying all the products in the user interface.
To handle errors, we chain a .catch() block onto the end of the chain. This runs if the promise fails for some reason. Inside it, we include a function that is passed as a parameter, an err object. This err object can be used to report the nature of the error that has occurred, in this case we do it with a simple console.error().
However, a complete website would handle this error more gracefully by displaying a message on the user's screen and perhaps offering options to remedy the situation, but we don't need anything more than a simple console.error().
You can test the failure case yourself:


Make a local copy of the example files.
Run the code through a web server (as described above, in Serving your example from a server).
Modify the path to the file being fetched, to something like 'produc.json' (make sure it is misspelled).
Now load the index file in your browser (via localhost:8000) and look in your browser developer console. You'll see a message similar to "Fetch problem: HTTP error: 404".

The second Fetch block can be found inside the fetchBlob() function:
jsfetch(url)
  .then((response) => {
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP error: ${response.status}`);
    }
    return response.blob();
  })
  .then((blob) => showProduct(blob, product))
  .catch((err) => console.error(`Fetch problem: ${err.message}`));

This works in much the same way as the previous one, except that instead of using json(), we use blob(). In this case we want to return our response as an image file, and the data format we use for that is Blob (the term is an abbreviation of "Binary Large Object" and can basically be used to represent large file-like objects, such as images or video files).
Once we've successfully received our blob, we pass it into our showProduct() function, which displays it.The XMLHttpRequest APISometimes, especially in older code, you'll see another API called XMLHttpRequest (often abbreviated as "XHR") used to make HTTP requests. This predated Fetch, and was really the first API widely used to implement AJAX. We recommend you use Fetch if you can: it's a simpler API and has more features than XMLHttpRequest. We won't go through an example that uses XMLHttpRequest, but we will show you what the XMLHttpRequest version of our first can store request would look like:
jsconst request = new XMLHttpRequest();

try {
  request.open("GET", "products.json");

  request.responseType = "json";

  request.addEventListener("load", () => initialize(request.response));
  request.addEventListener("error", () => console.error("XHR error"));

  request.send();
} catch (error) {
  console.error(`XHR error ${request.status}`);
}

There are five stages to this:

Create a new XMLHttpRequest object.
Call its open() method to initialize it.
Add an event listener to its load event, which fires when the response has completed successfully. In the listener we call initialize() with the data.
Add an event listener to its error event, which fires when the request encounters an error
Send the request.

We also have to wrap the whole thing in the try...catch block, to handle any errors thrown by open() or send().
Hopefully you think the Fetch API is an improvement over this. In particular, see how we have to handle errors in two different places.SummaryThis article shows how to start working with Fetch to fetch data from the server.See alsoThere are however a lot of different subjects discussed in this article, which has only really scratched the surface.

Another very common task in modern websites and applications is making network requests to retrieve individual data items from the server to update sections of a webpage without having to load an entire new page. This seemingly small detail has had a huge impact on the performance and behavior of sites, so in this article, we'll explain the concept and look at technologies that make it possible: in particular, the Fetch API.

What is the problem here?A web page consists of an HTML page and (usually) various other files, such as stylesheets, scripts, and images. The basic model of page loading on the Web is that your browser makes one or more HTTP requests to the server for the files needed to display the page, and the server responds with the requested files. If you visit another page, the browser requests the new files, and the server responds with them.

This model works perfectly well for many sites. But consider a website that's very data-driven. For example, a library website like the Vancouver Public Library. Among other things you could think of a site like this as a user interface to a database. It might let you search for a particular genre of book, or might show you recommendations for books you might like, based on books you've previously borrowed. When you do this, it needs to update the page with the new set of books to display. But note that most of the page content — including items like the page header, sidebar, and footer — stays the same.
The trouble with the traditional model here is that we'd have to fetch and load the entire page, even when we only need to update one part of it. This is inefficient and can result in a poor user experience.
So instead of the traditional model, many websites use JavaScript APIs to request data from the server and update the page content without a page load. So when the user searches for a new product, the browser only requests the data which is needed to update the page — the set of new books to display, for instance.

The main API here is the Fetch API. This enables JavaScript running in a page to make an HTTP request to a server to retrieve specific resources. When the server provides them, the JavaScript can use the data to update the page, typically by using DOM manipulation APIs. The data requested is often JSON, which is a good format for transferring structured data, but can also be HTML or just text.
This is a common pattern for data-driven sites such as Amazon, YouTube, eBay, and so on. With this model:

Page updates are a lot quicker and you don't have to wait for the page to refresh, meaning that the site feels faster and more responsive.
Less data is downloaded on each update, meaning less wasted bandwidth. This may not be such a big issue on a desktop on a broadband connection, but it's a major issue on mobile devices and in countries that don't have ubiquitous fast internet service.


Note:
In the early days, this general technique was known as Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX), because it tended to request XML data. This is normally not the case these days (you'd be more likely to request JSON), but the result is still the same, and the term "AJAX" is still often used to describe the technique.

To speed things up even further, some sites also store assets and data on the user's computer when they are first requested, meaning that on subsequent visits they use the local versions instead of downloading fresh copies every time the page is first loaded. The content is only reloaded from the server when it has been updated.The Fetch APILet's walk through a couple of examples of the Fetch API.Fetching text contentFor this example, we'll request data out of a few different text files and use them to populate a content area.

The WebSocket API makes it possible to open a two-way interactive communication session between the user's browser and a server. With this API, you can send messages to a server and receive responses without having to poll the server for a reply.
The WebSocket API provides two alternative mechanisms for creating and using web socket connections: the WebSocket interface and the WebSocketStream interface.

The WebSocket interface is stable and has good browser and server support. However it doesn't support backpressure. As a result, when messages arrive faster than the application can process them it will either fill up the device's memory by buffering those messages, become unresponsive due to 100% CPU usage, or both.
The WebSocketStream interface is a Promise-based alternative to WebSocket. It uses the Streams API to handle receiving and sending messages, meaning that socket connections can take advantage of stream backpressure automatically, regulating the speed of reading or writing to avoid bottlenecks in the application. However, WebSocketStream is non-standard and currently only supported in one rendering engine.

Additionally, the WebTransport API is expected to replace the WebSocket API for many applications. WebTransport is a versatile, low-level API that provides backpressure and many other features not supported by either WebSocket or WebSocketStream, such as unidirectional streams, out-of-order delivery, and unreliable data transmission via datagrams. WebTransport is more complex to use than WebSockets and its cross-browser support is not as wide, but it enables the implementation of sophisticated solutions. If standard WebSocket connections are a good fit for your use case and you need wide browser compatibility, you should employ the WebSockets API to get up and running quickly. However, if your application requires a non-standard custom solution, then you should use the WebTransport API.

Note:
While a WebSocket connection is functionally somewhat similar to standard Unix-style sockets, they are not related.
Interfaces
WebSocket

The primary interface for connecting to a WebSocket server and then sending and receiving data on the connection.

WebSocketStream 
Non-standard


Promise-based interface for connecting to a WebSocket server; uses streams to send and receive data on the connection.

CloseEvent

The event sent by the WebSocket object when the connection closes.

MessageEvent

The event sent by the WebSocket object when a message is received from the server.

Related HTTP headersThe HTTP headers are used in the WebSocket handshake:

Sec-WebSocket-Key

An HTTP request header that contains a nonce from the client.
This is used in the WebSocket opening handshake to verify that the client explicitly intends to open a WebSocket.
It is added automatically by the browser.

Sec-WebSocket-Accept

An HTTP response header used in the WebSocket opening handshake to indicate that the server is willing to upgrade to a WebSocket connection.
The value in the directive is calculated from the value of Sec-WebSocket-Key in the corresponding request.

Sec-WebSocket-Version

An HTTP header that in requests indicates the version of the WebSocket protocol understood by the client.
In responses, it is sent only if the requested protocol version is not supported by the server, and lists the versions that the server supports.

Sec-WebSocket-Protocol

An HTTP header that in requests indicates the sub-protocols supported by the client in preferred order.
In responses, it indicates the sub-protocol selected by the server from the client's preferences.

Sec-WebSocket-Extensions

An HTTP header that in requests indicates the WebSocket extensions supported by the client in preferred order.
In responses, it indicates the extension selected by the server from the client's preferences.

It uses the Streams API to handle receiving and sending messages, meaning that socket connections can take advantage of stream backpressure automatically, regulating the speed of reading or writing to avoid bottlenecks in the application. However, WebSocketStream is non-standard and currently only supported in one rendering engine.

Additionally, the WebTransport API is expected to replace the WebSocket API for many applications. WebTransport is a versatile, low-level API that provides backpressure and many other features not supported by either WebSocket or WebSocketStream, such as unidirectional streams, out-of-order delivery, and unreliable data transmission via datagrams. WebTransport is more complex to use than WebSockets and its cross-browser support is not as wide, but it enables the implementation of sophisticated solutions. If standard WebSocket connections are a good fit for your use case and you need wide browser compatibility, you should employ the WebSockets API to get up and running quickly. However, if your application requires a non-standard custom solution, then you should use the WebTransport API.

Note:
While a WebSocket connection is functionally somewhat similar to standard Unix-style sockets, they are not related.
Interfaces
WebSocket

The primary interface for connecting to a WebSocket server and then sending and receiving data on the connection.

WebSocketStream 
Non-standard


Promise-based interface for connecting to a WebSocket server; uses streams to send and receive data on the connection.

CloseEvent

The event sent by the WebSocket object when the connection closes.

MessageEvent

The event sent by the WebSocket object when a message is received from the server.

Related HTTP headersThe HTTP headers are used in the WebSocket handshake:

Sec-WebSocket-Key

An HTTP request header that contains a nonce from the client.
This is used in the WebSocket opening handshake to verify that the client explicitly intends to open a WebSocket.
It is added automatically by the browser.

Sec-WebSocket-Accept

An HTTP response header used in the WebSocket opening handshake to indicate that the server is willing to upgrade to a WebSocket connection.
The value in the directive is calculated from the value of Sec-WebSocket-Key in the corresponding request.

Sec-WebSocket-Version

An HTTP header that in requests indicates the version of the WebSocket protocol understood by the client.
In responses, it is sent only if the requested protocol version is not supported by the server, and lists the versions that the server supports.

Sec-WebSocket-Protocol

An HTTP header that in requests indicates the sub-protocols supported by the client in preferred order.
In responses, it indicates the sub-protocol selected by the server from the client's preferences.

Sec-WebSocket-Extensions

An HTTP header that in requests indicates the WebSocket extensions supported by the client in preferred order.
In responses, it indicates the extension selected by the server from the client's preferences.

The WebSocket API makes it possible to open a two-way interactive communication session between the user's browser and a server. With this API, you can send messages to a server and receive responses without having to poll the server for a reply.
The WebSocket API provides two alternative mechanisms for creating and using web socket connections: the WebSocket interface and the WebSocketStream interface.

The WebSocket interface is stable and has good browser and server support. However it doesn't support backpressure. As a result, when messages arrive faster than the application can process them it will either fill up the device's memory by buffering those messages, become unresponsive due to 100% CPU usage, or both.
The WebSocketStream interface is a Promise-based alternative to WebSocket. It uses the Streams API to handle receiving and sending messages, meaning that socket connections can take advantage of stream backpressure automatically, regulating the speed of reading or writing to avoid bottlenecks in the application. However, WebSocketStream is non-standard and currently only supported in one rendering engine.

Start contributing today and make a lasting impact
on the global developer community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating and working on issuesAs a contributor, you can report and work on issues.
After you report an issue, the issue gets triaged. Issue triaging is typically done by people assigned the role of a maintainer or an owner.General guidelines for participationWhile reporting an issue or participating in a conversation in an issue, always ensure that your inputs are contributing to the overall progress of the project. Consider whether the issues you open and your comments in an issue are constructive and on topic and are not just adding noise.
Do the following:

Before filing an issue, consider if you need to discuss it with the staff/community. Use discussions to gain different viewpoints and to converge on an agreed-upon course of action. This helps to keep issues focused and productive.
After filing an issue, try to fix the problem yourself. Read our contribution guide to learn more.
If you have a question, you can ask it in the MDN Web Docs chat rooms instead of filing an issue.

Avoid doing the following:

Complicating issues by trying to discuss multiple topics or by making off-topic comments.
Opening lots of issues asking vague questions.
Asking questions without trying to solve the problem yourself first.

If you want to suggest new documentation or ways to improve the website, see Proposing new content or features.Guidelines for reporting an issueIssues are used to track bugs. An issue must be a single actionable task or a collection of related actionable tasks and must have a clear outcome.Before filing an issueIf you think you've found a bug with the content on MDN Web Docs or with the look and feel of the website, search the current open issues in the relevant repository and make sure nobody else has reported the issue.Reporting an issueDepending on the type of problem you've discovered, you can report it by filing an issue on one of the main MDN GitHub repositories.
If the information you provide in the issue is incomplete, you might be asked to provide more details during the issue triaging process.
Here are some hints for opening issues:

Choose the appropriate category to report the issue. For example, to report a content bug, use the Content issue template in the mdn/content repository.
Provide sufficient information while reporting the issue:

Issue title must convey succinctly the required action.
Issue description must clearly describe the bug and the action required to resolve the issue. It must also list the task or sub-tasks to be completed to resolve the issue. Some other guidelines include:

Use the description field to indicate the status of the task or sub-tasks by using checklists.
Update the status of a task in the issue description instead of commenting on the issue. Use task lists in the description if an issue has multiple parts. This helps others who may otherwise need to scroll through comments on the issue to determine the status of various tasks.
Comments in an issue should be limited to details or context that help resolve the issue.




If you find yourself in one of the following situations, move the conversation to MDN's discussion on GitHub:

A discussion needs to take place to clarify an issue.
A discussion begins after opening the issue.
The issue has no clear consensus on its resolution.
The requirements for completing the task expand while it's being resolved or the work is unclear.


For minor bugs, you can make the changes yourself and submit a pull request.
Creating a task list issueIf the issue you're opening is not to report a bug but to perform a series of tasks, you can create the issue as a task list.
Explain the context or reason for performing the tasks in the description.
Ensure that you list all the actionable tasks as a checklist.
For example:
md// Issue title
Ensure sections follow the order defined in the CSS property template

### Description

The CSS property page template is defined [here](/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Page_structures/Page_types/CSS_property_page_template).
The task list in this issue will be used to compare the documented CSS properties with the template and track changes to the property pages for compliance.

### List of pages checked

- [x] [accent-color](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/accent-color) - checked, okay
- [ ] [backdrop-filter](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/backdrop-filter)
- [ ] [letter-spacing](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/letter-spacing) - open pull request to move `Accessibility concerns` and `Internationalization concerns` sections before the `Specifications` section.
Guidelines for working on an issueRemember that if you take on an issue, the expectation is for the work to be completed in a timely manner. If you're not able to make any progress for a week after being assigned or can no longer complete the required task, leave a comment and unassign yourself from the issue.
These are the general steps for working on an issue:


Find an issue: If you're looking to contribute, search for issues with good first issue, help wanted or p3 label. Most repositories have issues with these labels. You are welcome to browse and pick an issue that is suitable for your skill set. Another useful place to look for issues to work on is the MDN Contributors Task Board. This project view lists open issues from multiple repositories. You can filter the list based on the topics (Labels column) you're interested in. See the description of some of the labels that get applied during the issue triage process.

Note:
An issue with the needs triage label indicates that the MDN Web Docs core team has not reviewed the issue yet, and you shouldn't begin work on it.



Assign the issue to yourself: After finding an issue you'd like to work on, make sure that the issue is not assigned to anybody else. Add a comment saying you would like to work on the issue, and if you are able to, assign the issue to yourself.


Do the research: Most issues need some investigation before work can start.

Scope out the work that needs to be done. If you need to ask questions, ask them in the MDN Web Docs chat rooms.
If the issue is well-described, and the work is pretty obvious, go ahead and do it.
If the issue is not well-described, and/or you are not sure what is needed, feel free to @mention the poster and ask for more information.



Make the changes: Fork and branch the repository. Do your work and open a pull request in the repository. Reference the issue in the pull request description. Depending on the files you've updated in the pull request, a reviewer will be assigned to your pull request automatically. (Teams per topic area are defined in the CODEOWNERS file).
After opening the pull request, if you find you no longer have the time to make changes or incorporate review feedback, let the team know as soon as possible in a comment in the pull request. This will help the team assign another interested contributor to complete the work on the pull request and close the linked issue.


After your pull request has been reviewed and merged, you can mark the linked issue as closed. If you opened the pull request with Fixes #<issue> verbiage, the issue will be closed automatically when the pull request is merged.

Fixing issues yourselfIf you spot a bug — whether it's a problem with the website's look and feel or an error in documentation — you can try to fix it yourself. Learn how you can contribute by going through our contribution guide.
If the bug is small, such as a typo or a minor sentence improvement, or involves an uncontroversial fix, submit a pull request with the changes.
For all other type of bugs, begin by opening the issue. Add a comment about your intent to work on the issue and if possible, describe your proposed solution or steps to fix the issue.
Wait for the issue to be triaged, so that the MDN Web Docs team can verify that the issue is legit and approves your proposed solution.

Note:
If you open a pull request before the issue has been triaged, your time and effort might go waste if the linked issue is deemed invalid or the solution does not match the one expected by the MDN Web Docs team.
After the issue is triaged, assign the issue to yourself.

Using the guidelines on working on an issue, try to fix the problem by updating the appropriate source, such as:

The MDN Web Docs content (in English) in the mdn/content repository
The MDN Web Docs translated content in the mdn/translated-content repository
The MDN Web Docs frontend in the mdn/yari repository

Each repository includes useful information to guide you on how to contribute.
For more information, see our main GitHub repositories.Guidelines for triaging issuesIf you are a maintainer or an owner in the MDN Web Docs GitHub organization, you are responsible for triaging issues in one or more MDN Web Docs repository.
The overall process for triaging includes some general and some issue-specific tasks.General triaging tasks

When an issue is opened, the needs triage label is set on the issue automatically. You can search for this label to look for issues that need to be triaged. Contributors or anybody else should not work on the issue until the issue has been triaged. (Triagers should remember to remove the needs triage label after triaging the issue.)


In the mdn/content repository, an additional Content: label, such as Content:CSS or Content:WebAPI, is set on the issue automatically. This gets set based on the MDN URL mentioned in the issue. You can use the content-specific label to look for issues to be triaged in your specific topic area.


If an issue concerns an active, non-en-US locale, set the appropriate label, such as l10n-fr, l10n-zh, or l10n-ja. The teams for those locales will pick these issues up and triage them.


You don't need to actively triage issues all the time. Set aside time, say 30 minutes every week, to triage issues on a regular basis in your area of responsibility. Triaging doesn't have to be done as part of a synchronous meeting or even at the same time as everyone else, but it should be done regularly to make sure that the backlog of untriaged bugs doesn't get too high.


Apart from triaging incoming issues every week, review the list of old bugs to see if there are any that are stalled, need closing, or are no longer relevant. The idle label is automatically set on issues that have had no activity for 30 days.

Check assigned issues that are still open to see if the assignee is making progress. If there is no progress after a week of being assigned, ask them if they still have time to work on the issue. If another week passes by without any progress, unassign them and leave a comment indicating that you're making the issue available for other interested contributors.
If a pull request has been opened to fix the issue but has not been reviewed for a week, give the reviewer a gentle ping to ask if they can get to it.
If a pull request to fix the issue is waiting on review comments to be addressed after a week, then ask the author if they can respond to their review. If another week goes by, either fix the review comments yourself if you have time, or close the pull request and unassign the related issue.


Issue-specific triaging tasksThese are the guidelines to follow while triaging each issue.
Review if the issue is valid
These are some of the things to keep in mind while reviewing the validity of an issue:

Check if the issue raised is valid and if the fix will improve the content for the readers and the website.
Evaluate if the impact of the fix will be small or site-wide.
Evaluate if the fix for the issue will need a discussion first, in which case, point the author to open a discussion instead.
Check if the issue complies with our writing guidelines and templates.
Check whether suggestions for adding links comply with our external links policy.

Review the issue for completeness of information
Review each issue against the following checklist to ensure that the issue contains the described information for someone to start working on the bug:

URL of the MDN Web Docs page with the problem or URL of an example MDN Web Docs page if the problem exists on multiple pages
The specific heading or section on the MDN Web Docs page where the problem was found
A clear description of the incorrect, unhelpful, incomplete, or missing information

If any of the above information is not present, then you should ask the author of the issue to provide these details, and add the needs info label to the issue. Resume triaging the issue only after those details have been provided (after which, you can remove the needs info label). It is okay to wait for up to a week to get a response from the author.
Set a priority label
For each bug, set a priority label based on the severity of the issue to help people who want to work on the most important issues or areas.


Critical issue: This type of issue needs to be fixed as soon as possible, regardless of where it appears on the site. This type of issue could damage MDN's reputation severely and/or harm users. Examples of this issue include an incorrect code snippet, which if used in production, could create a severe security problem and undesirable content such as malware, profanity, pornography, hate speech, or links to such content.

Label: p0 (will be addressed immediately)



Major issue: This type of issue could severely affect a page's usefulness. For example, a significant amount of out-of-date information, a complex and important code example that doesn't work, a significant amount of prose that is badly written and hard to understand, or a large number of broken links.

Labels: p1 (will be addressed soon) and p2 (will be addressed soon, but higher priority items will take precedence)



Minor issue: This is a type of improvement issue that can make the existing content better but does not affect learning or only has a minor effect on learning. Since these types of issues are not actively planned for, help from contributors to fix these issues is welcome and much appreciated. Fixing some of these issues can also provide the necessary practice to beginner contributors who are starting to get familiar with the contribution process. Examples include typos, bad grammar, a broken link, a small amount of out-of-date information or badly-written prose, or a code snippet that doesn't work.

Labels: p3 (no visibility when the issue will be addressed)



In general, critical issues should be fixed immediately and are most likely handled by MDN Web Docs staff and peers.
Add helpful information
If possible, add information that can help contributors to fix the issue. The information can be in the form of steps, general approach, links to other similar fixed issues, or reading resources. A well-laid out plan or steps is especially required in issues that are labeled good first issue and can help ramp up new contributors quickly. You can time-box this task to 5-10 minutes.
For example, as a triager, you can add the following information to the issue you are triaging:
mdTo whoever fixes this issue, it looks like the following is needed:

- Update the first paragraph below heading X to correct the problem with Y
- Add a description of X
- Update the compatibility data at Link-X

Set other labels
Next, set the following labels as appropriate:


effort: small, effort: medium, effort: large: Some contributors like to search for bugs based on the time and effort that will be needed to fix the bug. So where possible, you should try to provide an estimate of the required effort.


good first issue: Set this label on the issue if the fix for the issue is really simple and if fixing the issue would provide good practice for a newcomer who is getting used to the process.


help wanted: Set this label if the issue requires help from someone who knows about or is familiar with the topic. This is a popular label and some contributors use it to search for issues to work on in open source projects in their areas of familiarity or expertise.


broken link external: Set this label if the issue involves a broken link to an external page.


document not written: Set this label if the issue involves a necessary document that has not been written yet, usually because a link points to it.


needs content update: Set this label if the issue fix in another repository will need an equivalent fix in the mdn/content repository.

Note:
After the triage process is complete, remove the needs triage label.\n\nCreating and working on issuesAs a contributor, you can report and work on issues.
After you report an issue, the issue gets triaged. Issue triaging is typically done by people assigned the role of a maintainer or an owner.General guidelines for participationWhile reporting an issue or participating in a conversation in an issue, always ensure that your inputs are contributing to the overall progress of the project. Consider whether the issues you open and your comments in an issue are constructive and on topic and are not just adding noise.
Do the following:

Before filing an issue, consider if you need to discuss it with the staff/community. Use discussions to gain different viewpoints and to converge on an agreed-upon course of action. This helps to keep issues focused and productive.
After filing an issue, try to fix the problem yourself. Read our contribution guide to learn more.
If you have a question, you can ask it in the MDN Web Docs chat rooms instead of filing an issue.

Avoid doing the following:

Complicating issues by trying to discuss multiple topics or by making off-topic comments.
Opening lots of issues asking vague questions.
Asking questions without trying to solve the problem yourself first.

If you want to suggest new documentation or ways to improve the website, see Proposing new content or features.Guidelines for reporting an issueIssues are used to track bugs. An issue must be a single actionable task or a collection of related actionable tasks and must have a clear outcome.Before filing an issueIf you think you've found a bug with the content on MDN Web Docs or with the look and feel of the website, search the current open issues in the relevant repository and make sure nobody else has reported the issue.Reporting an issueDepending on the type of problem you've discovered, you can report it by filing an issue on one of the main MDN GitHub repositories.
If the information you provide in the issue is incomplete, you might be asked to provide more details during the issue triaging process.
Here are some hints for opening issues:

Choose the appropriate category to report the issue. For example, to report a content bug, use the Content issue template in the mdn/content repository.
Provide sufficient information while reporting the issue:

Issue title must convey succinctly the required action.
Issue description must clearly describe the bug and the action required to resolve the issue. It must also list the task or sub-tasks to be completed to resolve the issue. Some other guidelines include:

Use the description field to indicate the status of the task or sub-tasks by using checklists.
Update the status of a task in the issue description instead of commenting on the issue. Use task lists in the description if an issue has multiple parts. This helps others who may otherwise need to scroll through comments on the issue to determine the status of various tasks.
Comments in an issue should be limited to details or context that help resolve the issue.




If you find yourself in one of the following situations, move the conversation to MDN's discussion on GitHub:

A discussion needs to take place to clarify an issue.
A discussion begins after opening the issue.
The issue has no clear consensus on its resolution.
The requirements for completing the task expand while it's being resolved or the work is unclear.


For minor bugs, you can make the changes yourself and submit a pull request.
Creating a task list issueIf the issue you're opening is not to report a bug but to perform a series of tasks, you can create the issue as a task list.
Explain the context or reason for performing the tasks in the description.
Ensure that you list all the actionable tasks as a checklist.
For example:
md// Issue title
Ensure sections follow the order defined in the CSS property template

### Description

The CSS property page template is defined [here](/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Page_structures/Page_types/CSS_property_page_template).
The task list in this issue will be used to compare the documented CSS properties with the template and track changes to the property pages for compliance.

### List of pages checked

- [x] [accent-color](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/accent-color) - checked, okay
- [ ] [backdrop-filter](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/backdrop-filter)
- [ ] [letter-spacing](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/letter-spacing) - open pull request to move `Accessibility concerns` and `Internationalization concerns` sections before the `Specifications` section.
Guidelines for working on an issueRemember that if you take on an issue, the expectation is for the work to be completed in a timely manner. If you're not able to make any progress for a week after being assigned or can no longer complete the required task, leave a comment and unassign yourself from the issue.
These are the general steps for working on an issue:


Find an issue: If you're looking to contribute, search for issues with good first issue, help wanted or p3 label. Most repositories have issues with these labels. You are welcome to browse and pick an issue that is suitable for your skill set. Another useful place to look for issues to work on is the MDN Contributors Task Board. This project view lists open issues from multiple repositories. You can filter the list based on the topics (Labels column) you're interested in. See the description of some of the labels that get applied during the issue triage process.

Note:
An issue with the needs triage label indicates that the MDN Web Docs core team has not reviewed the issue yet, and you shouldn't begin work on it.



Assign the issue to yourself: After finding an issue you'd like to work on, make sure that the issue is not assigned to anybody else. Add a comment saying you would like to work on the issue, and if you are able to, assign the issue to yourself.


Do the research: Most issues need some investigation before work can start.

Scope out the work that needs to be done. If you need to ask questions, ask them in the MDN Web Docs chat rooms.
If the issue is well-described, and the work is pretty obvious, go ahead and do it.
If the issue is not well-described, and/or you are not sure what is needed, feel free to @mention the poster and ask for more information.



Make the changes: Fork and branch the repository. Do your work and open a pull request in the repository. Reference the issue in the pull request description. Depending on the files you've updated in the pull request, a reviewer will be assigned to your pull request automatically. (Teams per topic area are defined in the CODEOWNERS file).
After opening the pull request, if you find you no longer have the time to make changes or incorporate review feedback, let the team know as soon as possible in a comment in the pull request. This will help the team assign another interested contributor to complete the work on the pull request and close the linked issue.


After your pull request has been reviewed and merged, you can mark the linked issue as closed. If you opened the pull request with Fixes #<issue> verbiage, the issue will be closed automatically when the pull request is merged.

Fixing issues yourselfIf you spot a bug — whether it's a problem with the website's look and feel or an error in documentation — you can try to fix it yourself. Learn how you can contribute by going through our contribution guide.
If the bug is small, such as a typo or a minor sentence improvement, or involves an uncontroversial fix, submit a pull request with the changes.

If a pull request has been opened to fix the issue but has not been reviewed for a week, give the reviewer a gentle ping to ask if they can get to it.
If a pull request to fix the issue is waiting on review comments to be addressed after a week, then ask the author if they can respond to their review. If another week goes by, either fix the review comments yourself if you have time, or close the pull request and unassign the related issue.


Issue-specific triaging tasksThese are the guidelines to follow while triaging each issue.
Review if the issue is valid
These are some of the things to keep in mind while reviewing the validity of an issue:

Check if the issue raised is valid and if the fix will improve the content for the readers and the website.
Evaluate if the impact of the fix will be small or site-wide.
Evaluate if the fix for the issue will need a discussion first, in which case, point the author to open a discussion instead.
Check if the issue complies with our writing guidelines and templates.
Check whether suggestions for adding links comply with our external links policy.

Review the issue for completeness of information
Review each issue against the following checklist to ensure that the issue contains the described information for someone to start working on the bug:

URL of the MDN Web Docs page with the problem or URL of an example MDN Web Docs page if the problem exists on multiple pages
The specific heading or section on the MDN Web Docs page where the problem was found
A clear description of the incorrect, unhelpful, incomplete, or missing information

If any of the above information is not present, then you should ask the author of the issue to provide these details, and add the needs info label to the issue. Resume triaging the issue only after those details have been provided (after which, you can remove the needs info label). It is okay to wait for up to a week to get a response from the author.
Set a priority label
For each bug, set a priority label based on the severity of the issue to help people who want to work on the most important issues or areas.


Critical issue: This type of issue needs to be fixed as soon as possible, regardless of where it appears on the site. This type of issue could damage MDN's reputation severely and/or harm users. Examples of this issue include an incorrect code snippet, which if used in production, could create a severe security problem and undesirable content such as malware, profanity, pornography, hate speech, or links to such content.

Label: p0 (will be addressed immediately)



Major issue: This type of issue could severely affect a page's usefulness. For example, a significant amount of out-of-date information, a complex and important code example that doesn't work, a significant amount of prose that is badly written and hard to understand, or a large number of broken links.

Labels: p1 (will be addressed soon) and p2 (will be addressed soon, but higher priority items will take precedence)



Minor issue: This is a type of improvement issue that can make the existing content better but does not affect learning or only has a minor effect on learning. Since these types of issues are not actively planned for, help from contributors to fix these issues is welcome and much appreciated. Fixing some of these issues can also provide the necessary practice to beginner contributors who are starting to get familiar with the contribution process. Examples include typos, bad grammar, a broken link, a small amount of out-of-date information or badly-written prose, or a code snippet that doesn't work.

Labels: p3 (no visibility when the issue will be addressed)



In general, critical issues should be fixed immediately and are most likely handled by MDN Web Docs staff and peers.
Add helpful information
If possible, add information that can help contributors to fix the issue. The information can be in the form of steps, general approach, links to other similar fixed issues, or reading resources. A well-laid out plan or steps is especially required in issues that are labeled good first issue and can help ramp up new contributors quickly. You can time-box this task to 5-10 minutes.
For example, as a triager, you can add the following information to the issue you are triaging:
mdTo whoever fixes this issue, it looks like the following is needed:

- Update the first paragraph below heading X to correct the problem with Y
- Add a description of X
- Update the compatibility data at Link-X

Set other labels
Next, set the following labels as appropriate:


effort: small, effort: medium, effort: large: Some contributors like to search for bugs based on the time and effort that will be needed to fix the bug. So where possible, you should try to provide an estimate of the required effort.


good first issue: Set this label on the issue if the fix for the issue is really simple and if fixing the issue would provide good practice for a newcomer who is getting used to the process.


help wanted: Set this label if the issue requires help from someone who knows about or is familiar with the topic. This is a popular label and some contributors use it to search for issues to work on in open source projects in their areas of familiarity or expertise.


broken link external: Set this label if the issue involves a broken link to an external page.


document not written: Set this label if the issue involves a necessary document that has not been written yet, usually because a link points to it.


needs content update: Set this label if the issue fix in another repository will need an equivalent fix in the mdn/content repository.

Note:
After the triage process is complete, remove the needs triage label.

Contributor spotlight


There are many other things I like about MDN: the openness of its
governance, the respect for contributors' work, the professional
conversations, and the always timely reviews. MDN has consistently
demonstrated the ideal form of an open-source project.

Joshua Chen (MDN contributor)



MDN Web Docs has the most up-to-date and accurate information and the
content is presented in an easy-to-understand manner. I also like that it's
available in many languages (very important!).

Yuji (MDN contributor)



There are millions of web developers in China, and many of them begin their
developer journey at MDN Web Docs. Contributing to MDN Web Docs is an
excellent way to help people who are starting out.

This is big news for web developers because working with dates and times in JavaScript will be hugely simplified and modernized.
Applications that rely on scheduling, internationalization, or time-sensitive data will be able to use built-ins for efficient, precise and consistent dates, times, durations, and calendars.
We're a long way away from stable, cross-browser support, and there may be changes as implementations develop, but we can already take a look at Temporal as it stands now, why it's exciting, and what problems it solves.
To help you get up to speed, there are over 270 pages of Temporal docs on MDN added this week, with detailed explanations and examples.What is JavaScript Temporal?To understand Temporal, we can look at JavaScript's Date object.
When JavaScript was created in 1995, the Date object was copied from Java's early, flawed java.util.Date implementation.
Java replaced this implementation in 1997, but JavaScript is stuck with the same API for almost 30 years, despite known problems.
The major issues with JavaScript's Date object are that it only supports the user's local time and UTC, and there's no time zone support.
Additionally, its parsing behavior is very unreliable, and Date itself is mutable, which can introduce hard-to-trace bugs.
There are other problems like calculations across Daylight Saving Time (DST) and historical calendar changes, which are notoriously difficult to work with.
All of these issues make working with dates and times in JavaScript complex and prone to bugs, which can have serious consequences for some systems.
Most developers rely on dedicated libraries like Moment.js and date-fns for better handling of dates and times in their applications.
Temporal is designed as a full replacement for the Date object, making date and time management reliable and predictable.
Temporal adds support for time zone and calendar representations, many built-in methods for conversions, comparisons and computations, formatting, and more.
The API surface has over 200 utility methods, and you can find information about all of them in the Temporal docs on MDN.Core conceptsIn Temporal, the key concepts are that it has instants (unique points in history), wall-clock times (regional time), and durations.
The APIs have this overall structure to handle these concepts:

Duration: Temporal.Duration the difference between two points in time
Points in time:

Unique points in time:

As a timestamp: Temporal.Instant
A date-time with a time zone: Temporal.ZonedDateTime


Time-zone-unaware date/time ("Plain"):

Full date and time: Temporal.PlainDateTime

Just the date: Temporal.PlainDate

Year and month: Temporal.PlainYearMonth
Month and day: Temporal.PlainMonthDay


Just the time: Temporal.PlainTime






Now: using Temporal.now to get the current time as various class instances, or in a specific format
Temporal examplesSome of the most basic usages of Temporal include getting current dates and times as an ISO string, but we can see from the example below, that we can now provide time zones with many methods, which takes care of complex calculations you may be doing yourself:
js// The current date in the system's time zone
const dateTime = Temporal.Now.plainDateTimeISO();
console.log(dateTime); // e.g.: 2025-01-22T11:46:36.144

// The current date in the "America/New_York" time zone
const dateTimeInNewYork = Temporal.Now.plainDateTimeISO("America/New_York");
console.log(dateTimeInNewYork);
// e.g.: 2025-01-22T05:47:02.555

Working with different calendars is also simplified, as it's possible to create dates in calendar systems other than Gregorian, such as Hebrew, Chinese, and Islamic, for example.
The code below helps you find out when the next Chinese New Year is (which is quite soon!):
js// Chinese New Years are on 1/1 in the Chinese calendar
const chineseNewYear = Temporal.PlainMonthDay.from({
  monthCode: "M01",
  day: 1,
  calendar: "chinese",
});
const currentYear = Temporal.Now.plainDateISO().withCalendar("chinese").year;
let nextCNY = chineseNewYear.toPlainDate({ year: currentYear });
// If nextCNY is before the current date, move forward by 1 year
if (Temporal.PlainDate.compare(nextCNY, Temporal.Now.plainDateISO()) <= 0) {
  nextCNY = nextCNY.add({ years: 1 });
}
console.log(
  `The next Chinese New Year is on ${nextCNY.withCalendar("iso8601").toLocaleString()}`,
);
// The next Chinese New Year is on 1/29/2025 (at the time of writing)

Working with Unix timestamps is a very common use case as many systems (APIs, databases) use the format to represent times.
The following example shows how to take a Unix Epoch timestamp in milliseconds, create an instant from it, get the current time with Temporal.Now, then calculate how many hours from now until the Unix timestamp:
js// 1851222399924 is our timestamp
const launch = Temporal.Instant.fromEpochMilliseconds(1851222399924);
const now = Temporal.Now.instant();
const duration = now.until(launch, { smallestUnit: "hour" });
console.log(`It will be ${duration.toLocaleString("en-US")} until the launch`);
// "It will be 31,600 hr until the launch" <- @js-temporal/polyfill
// "It will be PT31600H until the launch" <- Firefox Nightly

Currently, toLocaleString doesn't output a locale-sensitive string in the Firefox implementation, so durations above (PT31600H) are returned as a non-locale-sensitive duration format.
This may change as it's more of a design decision rather than a technical limitation as formatting the duration is possible, so the polyfill and Firefox implementations may eventually converge.
There's a lot to highlight, but one pattern that I thought was interesting in the API is the compare() methods, which allow you to sort durations in an elegant and efficient way:
jsconst durations = [
  Temporal.Duration.from({ hours: 1 }),
  Temporal.Duration.from({ hours: 2 }),
  Temporal.Duration.from({ hours: 1, minutes: 30 }),
  Temporal.Duration.from({ hours: 1, minutes: 45 }),
];

durations.sort(Temporal.Duration.compare);
console.log(durations.map((d) => d.toString()));
// [ 'PT1H', 'PT1H30M', 'PT1H45M', 'PT2H' ]
Trying Temporal and browser supportSupport is slowly starting to be included in experimental browser releases, and Firefox appears to have the most mature implementation at this point.
In Firefox, Temporal is being built into the Nightly version behind the javascript.options.experimental.temporal preference.
If you want to see the full compatibility story, you can check the (quite epic) Temporal object Browser Compatibility section.
Here are the main browser bugs that track Temporal implementations:

Firefox: Build temporal in Nightly by default
Safari: [JSC] Implement Temporal
Chrome: Implement the Temporal proposal

Additionally, you can visit https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/ which has @js-temporal/polyfill available.
That means, you can open the developer tools on the TC39 docs page, and try some of the examples in the console in any browser without changing flags or preferences.
With experimental implementations landing, now is a good time to try out Temporal and become familiar with what will be the modern approach to handling dates and times in JavaScript.Acknowledgements

const dateTime = Temporal.Now.plainDateTimeISO();
console.log(dateTime); // e.g.: 2025-01-22T11:46:36.144

// The current date in the "America/New_York" time zone
const dateTimeInNewYork = Temporal.Now.plainDateTimeISO("America/New_York");
console.log(dateTimeInNewYork);
// e.g.: 2025-01-22T05:47:02.555

Working with different calendars is also simplified, as it's possible to create dates in calendar systems other than Gregorian, such as Hebrew, Chinese, and Islamic, for example.
The code below helps you find out when the next Chinese New Year is (which is quite soon!):
js// Chinese New Years are on 1/1 in the Chinese calendar
const chineseNewYear = Temporal.PlainMonthDay.from({
  monthCode: "M01",
  day: 1,
  calendar: "chinese",
});
const currentYear = Temporal.Now.plainDateISO().withCalendar("chinese").year;
let nextCNY = chineseNewYear.toPlainDate({ year: currentYear });
// If nextCNY is before the current date, move forward by 1 year
if (Temporal.PlainDate.compare(nextCNY, Temporal.Now.plainDateISO()) <= 0) {
  nextCNY = nextCNY.add({ years: 1 });
}
console.log(
  `The next Chinese New Year is on ${nextCNY.withCalendar("iso8601").toLocaleString()}`,
);
// The next Chinese New Year is on 1/29/2025 (at the time of writing)

Working with Unix timestamps is a very common use case as many systems (APIs, databases) use the format to represent times.
The following example shows how to take a Unix Epoch timestamp in milliseconds, create an instant from it, get the current time with Temporal.Now, then calculate how many hours from now until the Unix timestamp:
js// 1851222399924 is our timestamp
const launch = Temporal.Instant.fromEpochMilliseconds(1851222399924);
const now = Temporal.Now.instant();
const duration = now.until(launch, { smallestUnit: "hour" });
console.log(`It will be ${duration.toLocaleString("en-US")} until the launch`);
// "It will be 31,600 hr until the launch" <- @js-temporal/polyfill
// "It will be PT31600H until the launch" <- Firefox Nightly

Currently, toLocaleString doesn't output a locale-sensitive string in the Firefox implementation, so durations above (PT31600H) are returned as a non-locale-sensitive duration format.
This may change as it's more of a design decision rather than a technical limitation as formatting the duration is possible, so the polyfill and Firefox implementations may eventually converge.
There's a lot to highlight, but one pattern that I thought was interesting in the API is the compare() methods, which allow you to sort durations in an elegant and efficient way:
jsconst durations = [
  Temporal.Duration.from({ hours: 1 }),
  Temporal.Duration.from({ hours: 2 }),
  Temporal.Duration.from({ hours: 1, minutes: 30 }),
  Temporal.Duration.from({ hours: 1, minutes: 45 }),
];

durations.sort(Temporal.Duration.compare);
console.log(durations.map((d) => d.toString()));
// [ 'PT1H', 'PT1H30M', 'PT1H45M', 'PT2H' ]
Trying Temporal and browser supportSupport is slowly starting to be included in experimental browser releases, and Firefox appears to have the most mature implementation at this point.
In Firefox, Temporal is being built into the Nightly version behind the javascript.options.experimental.temporal preference.
If you want to see the full compatibility story, you can check the (quite epic) Temporal object Browser Compatibility section.
Here are the main browser bugs that track Temporal implementations:

Firefox: Build temporal in Nightly by default
Safari: [JSC] Implement Temporal
Chrome: Implement the Temporal proposal

Additionally, you can visit https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/ which has @js-temporal/polyfill available.
That means, you can open the developer tools on the TC39 docs page, and try some of the examples in the console in any browser without changing flags or preferences.
With experimental implementations landing, now is a good time to try out Temporal and become familiar with what will be the modern approach to handling dates and times in JavaScript.Acknowledgements

Certain elements are defined as anchor elements; anchor-positioned elements can then have their size and position set based on the size and location of the anchor elements to which they are bound.
In addition, the specification provides CSS-only mechanisms to:

Specify a set of alternative positions for an anchored element; when the default rendering position causes it to overflow its containing block and/or be rendered offscreen, the browser will try rendering the anchored element in the alternative positions instead.
Declare conditions under which anchor-positioned elements should be hidden, in situations where it is not appropriate to tether them to anchor elements.

This covers view transitions for both DOM state updates in a single-page app (SPA), and navigating between documents in a multi-page app (MPA).The view transition processLet's walk through the process by which a view transition works:


A view transition is triggered. How this is done depends on the type of view transition:

In the case of same-document transitions (SPAs), a view transition is triggered by passing the function that would trigger the view change DOM update as a callback to the document.startViewTransition() method.
In the case of cross-document transitions (MPAs), a view transition is triggered by initiating navigation to a new document. Both the current and destination documents of the navigation need to be on the same origin, and opt-in to the view transition by including a @view-transition at rule in their CSS with a navigation descriptor of auto.

Note:
An active view transition has an associated ViewTransition instance (for example, returned by startViewTransition() in the case of same-document (SPA) transitions). The ViewTransition object includes several promises, allowing you to run code in response to different parts of the view transition process being reached. See Controlling view transitions with JavaScript for more information.





On the current (old page) view, the API captures snapshots of elements that have a view-transition-name declared on them.


The view change occurs:


In the case of same-document transitions (SPAs), the callback passed to startViewTransition() is invoked, which causes the DOM to change.
When the callback has run successfully, the ViewTransition.updateCallbackDone promise fulfills, allowing you to respond to the DOM updating.


In the case of cross-document transitions (MPAs), the navigation occurs between the current and destination documents.




The API captures snapshots from the new view as a live representation.
At this point, the view transition is about to run, and the ViewTransition.ready promise fulfills, allowing you to respond by running a custom JavaScript animation instead of the default, for example.


The old page snapshots animate "out", while the new view snapshots animate "in". By default, the old view snapshots animate from opacity 1 to 0, and the new view snapshots animate from opacity 0 to 1, which creates a cross-fade.


When the transition animations have reached their end states, the ViewTransition.finished promise fulfills, allowing you to respond.



Note:
If the document's page visibility state is hidden (for example if the document is obscured by a window, the browser is minimized, or another browser tab is active) during a document.startViewTransition() call, the view transition is skipped entirely.
The view transition pseudo-element treeTo handle creating the outbound and inbound transition animations, the API constructs a pseudo-element tree with the following structure:
::view-transition
└─ ::view-transition-group(root)
  └─ ::view-transition-image-pair(root)
      ├─ ::view-transition-old(root)
      └─ ::view-transition-new(root)


Note:
A ::view-transition-group subtree is created for every captured view-transition-name.

In the case of same-document transitions (SPAs), the pseudo-element tree is made available in the document. In the case of cross-document transitions (MPAs), the pseudo-element tree is made available in the destination document only.
The most interesting parts of the tree structure are as follows:


::view-transition is the root of view transitions overlay, which contains all view transition snapshot groups and sits over the top of all other page content.


A ::view-transition-group acts as a container for each view transition snapshot group. The root argument specifies the default snapshot group — the view transition animation will apply to the snapshot whose view-transition-name is root. By default, this is the :root element, because the default browser styles define this:
css:root {
  view-transition-name: root;
}

Be aware however that page authors can change this by unsetting the above, and setting view-transition-name: root on a different element.


::view-transition-old targets the static snapshot of the old page element, and ::view-transition-new targets the live snapshot of the new page element. Both of these render as replaced content, in the same manner as an <img> or <video>, meaning that they can be styled with handy properties like object-fit and object-position.



Note:
It is possible to target different DOM elements with different custom view transition animations by setting a different view-transition-name on each one. In such cases, a ::view-transition-group is created for each one. See Different animations for different elements for an example.


Note:
As you'll see later, to customize the outbound and inbound animations you need to target the ::view-transition-old and ::view-transition-new pseudo-elements with your animations, respectively.
Creating a basic view transitionThis section illustrates how to create a basic view transition, in both the SPA and MPA case.Basic SPA view transitionAs an example, an SPA may include functionality to fetch new content and update the DOM in response to an event of some kind, such as a navigation link being clicked or an update being pushed from the server. In our View Transitions SPA demo we've simplified this to a displayNewImage() function that shows a new full-size image based on the thumbnail that was clicked. We've encapsulated this inside an updateView() function that only calls the View Transition API if the browser supports it:
jsfunction updateView(event) {
  // Handle the difference in whether the event is fired on the <a> or the <img>
  const targetIdentifier = event.target.firstChild || event.target;

  const displayNewImage = () => {
    const mainSrc = `${targetIdentifier.src.split("_th.jpg")[0]}.jpg`;
    galleryImg.src = mainSrc;
    galleryCaption.textContent = targetIdentifier.alt;
  };

  // Fallback for browsers that don't support View Transitions:
  if (!document.startViewTransition) {
    displayNewImage();
    return;
  }

  // With View Transitions:
  const transition = document.startViewTransition(() => displayNewImage());
}

This code is enough to handle the transition between displayed images. Supporting browsers will show the change from old to new images and captions as a smooth cross-fade (the default view transition). It will still work in non-supporting browsers but without the nice animation.Basic MPA view transitionWhen creating a cross-document (MPA) view transition, the process is even simpler than for SPAs. No JavaScript is required, as the view update is triggered by a cross-document, same-origin navigation rather than a JavaScript-initiated DOM change. To enable a basic MPA view transition, you need to specify a @view-transition at-rule in the CSS for both the current and destination documents to opt them in, like so:
css@view-transition {
  navigation: auto;
}

Our View Transitions MPA demo shows this at-rule in action, and additionally demonstrates how to customize the outbound and inbound animations of the view transition.

Note:
Currently MPA view transitions can only be created between same-origin documents, but this restriction may be relaxed in future implementations.
Customizing your animationsThe View Transitions pseudo-elements have default CSS Animations applied (which are detailed in their reference pages).
Most appearance transitions are given a default smooth cross-fade animation, as mentioned above. There are some exceptions:

height and width transitions have a smooth scaling animation applied.
position and transform transitions have a smooth movement animation applied.

You can modify the default animations in any way you want using regular CSS — target the "from" animation with ::view-transition-old, and the "to" animation with ::view-transition-new.
For example, to change the speed of both:
css::view-transition-old(root),
::view-transition-new(root) {
  animation-duration: 0.5s;
}

It is recommended that you target the ::view-transition-group() with such styles in cases where you want to apply them to ::view-transition-old() and ::view-transition-new(). Because of the pseudo-element hierarchy and default user-agent styling, the styles will be inherited by both. For example:
css::view-transition-group(root) {
  animation-duration: 0.5s;
}


Note:
This is also a good option for safeguarding your code — ::view-transition-group() also animates and you could end up with different durations for the group/image-pair pseudo-elements versus the old and new pseudo-elements.

In the case of cross-document (MPA) transitions, the pseudo-elements need to be included in the destination document only for the view transition to work. If you want to use the view transition in both directions, you'll need to include it in both, of course.
Our View Transitions MPA demo includes the above CSS, but takes the customization a step further, defining custom animations and applying them to the ::view-transition-old(root) and ::view-transition-new(root) pseudo-elements. The result is that the default cross-fade transition is swapped out for a "swipe up" transition when navigation occurs:
css/* Create a custom animation */

@keyframes move-out {
  from {
    transform: translateY(0%);
  }

  to {
    transform: translateY(-100%);
  }
}

@keyframes move-in {
  from {
    transform: translateY(100%);
  }

  to {
    transform: translateY(0%);
  }
}

/* Apply the custom animation to the old and new page states */

::view-transition-old(root) {
  animation: 0.4s ease-in both move-out;
}

::view-transition-new(root) {
  animation: 0.4s ease-in both move-in;
}
Different animations for different elementsBy default, all of the different elements that change during the view update are transitioned using the same animation. If you want some elements to animate differently from the default root animation, you can separate them out using the view-transition-name property. For example, in our View Transitions SPA demo the <figcaption> elements are given a view-transition-name of figure-caption to separate them from the rest of the page in terms of view transitions:
cssfigcaption {
  view-transition-name: figure-caption;
}

With this CSS applied, the generated pseudo-element tree will now look like this:
::view-transition
├─ ::view-transition-group(root)
│ └─ ::view-transition-image-pair(root)
│     ├─ ::view-transition-old(root)
│     └─ ::view-transition-new(root)
└─ ::view-transition-group(figure-caption)
  └─ ::view-transition-image-pair(figure-caption)
      ├─ ::view-transition-old(figure-caption)
      └─ ::view-transition-new(figure-caption)

The existence of the second set of pseudo-elements allows separate view transition styling to be applied just to the <figcaption>. The different old and new view captures are handled separately from one another.

Note:
The value of view-transition-name can be anything you want except for none — the none value specifically means that the element will not participate in a view transition.
view-transition-name values must also be unique. If two rendered elements have the same view-transition-name at the same time, ViewTransition.ready will reject and the transition will be skipped.

The following code applies a custom animation just to the <figcaption>:
css@keyframes grow-x {
  from {
    transform: scaleX(0);
  }
  to {
    transform: scaleX(1);
  }
}

@keyframes shrink-x {
  from {
    transform: scaleX(1);
  }
  to {
    transform: scaleX(0);
  }
}

::view-transition-group(figure-caption) {
  height: auto;
  right: 0;
  left: auto;
  transform-origin: right center;
}

::view-transition-old(figure-caption) {
  animation: 0.25s linear both shrink-x;
}

::view-transition-new(figure-caption) {
  animation: 0.25s 0.25s linear both grow-x;
}

Here we've created a custom CSS animation and applied it to the ::view-transition-old(figure-caption) and ::view-transition-new(figure-caption) pseudo-elements. We've also added a number of other styles to both to keep them in the same place and stop the default styling from interfering with our custom animations.

Note:
You can use * as the identifier in a pseudo-element to target all snapshot pseudo-elements, regardless of what name they have. For example:
css::view-transition-group(*) {
  animation-duration: 2s;
}

Taking advantage of the default animation stylesNote that we also discovered another transition option that is simpler and produced a nicer result than the above. Our final <figcaption> view transition ended up looking like this:
cssfigcaption {
  view-transition-name: figure-caption;
}

::view-transition-group(figure-caption) {
  height: 100%;
}

This works because, by default, ::view-transition-group transitions width and height between the old and new views with a smooth scale. We just needed to set a fixed height on both states to make it work.

Note: Smooth transitions with the View Transition API contains several other customization examples.
Controlling view transitions with JavaScriptA view transition has an associated ViewTransition object instance, which contains several promise members allowing you to run JavaScript in response to different states of the transition being reached. For example, ViewTransition.ready fulfills once the pseudo-element tree is created and the animation is about to start, whereas ViewTransition.finished fulfills once the animation is finished, and the new page view is visible and interactive to the user.
The ViewTransition can be accessed like so:


In the case of same-document (SPA) transitions, the document.startViewTransition() method returns the ViewTransition associated with the transition.


In the case of cross-document (MPA) transitions:

A pageswap event is fired when a document is about to be unloaded due to a navigation. Its event object (PageSwapEvent) provides access to the ViewTransition via the PageSwapEvent.viewTransition property, as well as a NavigationActivation via PageSwapEvent.activation containing the navigation type and current and destination document history entries.

Note:
If the navigation has a cross-origin URL anywhere in the redirect chain, the activation property returns null.


A pagereveal event is fired when a document is first rendered, either when loading a fresh document from the network or activating a document (either from back/forward cache (bfcache) or prerender). Its event object (PageRevealEvent) provides access to the ViewTransition via the PageRevealEvent.viewTransition property.



Let's have a look at some example code to show how these features could be used.A JavaScript-powered custom same-document (SPA) transitionThe following JavaScript could be used to create a circular reveal view transition emanating from the position of the user's cursor on click, with animation provided by the Web Animations API.
js// Store the last click event
let lastClick;
addEventListener("click", (event) => (lastClick = event));

function spaNavigate(data) {
  // Fallback for browsers that don't support this API:
  if (!document.startViewTransition) {
    updateTheDOMSomehow(data);
    return;
  }

  // Get the click position, or fallback to the middle of the screen
  const x = lastClick?.clientX ?? innerWidth / 2;
  const y = lastClick?.clientY ?? innerHeight / 2;
  // Get the distance to the furthest corner
  const endRadius = Math.hypot(
    Math.max(x, innerWidth - x),
    Math.max(y, innerHeight - y),
  );

  // Create a transition:
  const transition = document.startViewTransition(() => {
    updateTheDOMSomehow(data);
  });

  // Wait for the pseudo-elements to be created:
  transition.ready.then(() => {
    // Animate the root's new view
    document.documentElement.animate(
      {
        clipPath: [
          `circle(0 at ${x}px ${y}px)`,
          `circle(${endRadius}px at ${x}px ${y}px)`,
        ],
      },
      {
        duration: 500,
        easing: "ease-in",
        // Specify which pseudo-element to animate
        pseudoElement: "::view-transition-new(root)",
      },
    );
  });
}

This animation also requires the following CSS, to turn off the default CSS animation and stop the old and new view states from blending in any way (the new state "wipes" right over the top of the old state, rather than transitioning in):
css::view-transition-image-pair(root) {
  isolation: auto;
}

::view-transition-old(root),
::view-transition-new(root) {
  animation: none;
  mix-blend-mode: normal;
  display: block;
}
A JavaScript-powered custom cross-document (MPA) transitionThe List of Chrome DevRel team members demo provides a basic set of team profile pages, and demonstrates how to use the pageswap and pagereveal events to customize the outgoing and inbound animations of a cross-document view transition based on the "from" and "to" URLs.
The pageswap event listener looks as follows. This sets view transition names on the elements on the outbound page that link to the profile pages. When navigating from the home page to a profile page, custom animations are provided only for the linked element that is clicked in each case.
jswindow.addEventListener("pageswap", async (e) => {
  // Only run this if an active view transition exists
  if (e.viewTransition) {
    const currentUrl = e.activation.from?.url
      ? new URL(e.activation.from.url)
      : null;
    const targetUrl = new URL(e.activation.entry.url);

    // Going from profile page to homepage
    // ~> The big img and title are the ones!
    if (isProfilePage(currentUrl) && isHomePage(targetUrl)) {
      // Set view-transition-name values on the elements to animate
      document.querySelector(`#detail main h1`).style.viewTransitionName =
        "name";
      document.querySelector(`#detail main img`).style.viewTransitionName =
        "avatar";

      // Remove view-transition-names after snapshots have been taken
      // Stops naming conflicts resulting from the page state persisting in BFCache
      await e.viewTransition.finished;
      document.querySelector(`#detail main h1`).style.viewTransitionName =
        "none";
      document.querySelector(`#detail main img`).style.viewTransitionName =
        "none";
    }

    // Going to profile page
    // ~> The clicked items are the ones!
    if (isProfilePage(targetUrl)) {
      const profile = extractProfileNameFromUrl(targetUrl);

      // Set view-transition-name values on the elements to animate
      document.querySelector(`#${profile} span`).style.viewTransitionName =
        "name";
      document.querySelector(`#${profile} img`).style.viewTransitionName =
        "avatar";

      // Remove view-transition-names after snapshots have been taken
      // Stops naming conflicts resulting from the page state persisting in BFCache
      await e.viewTransition.finished;
      document.querySelector(`#${profile} span`).style.viewTransitionName =
        "none";
      document.querySelector(`#${profile} img`).style.viewTransitionName =
        "none";
    }
  }
});


Note:
We remove the view-transition-name values after snapshots have been taken in each case. If we left them set, they would persist in the page state saved in the bfcache upon navigation. If the back button was then pressed, the pagereveal event handler of the page being navigated back to would then attempt to set the same view-transition-name values on different elements. If multiple elements have the same view-transition-name set, the view transition is skipped.

The pagereveal event listener looks as follows. This works in a similar way to the pageswap event listener, although bear in mind that here we are customizing the "to" animation, for page elements on the new page.
jswindow.addEventListener("pagereveal", async (e) => {
  // If the "from" history entry does not exist, return
  if (!navigation.activation.from) return;

  // Only run this if an active view transition exists
  if (e.viewTransition) {
    const fromUrl = new URL(navigation.activation.from.url);
    const currentUrl = new URL(navigation.activation.entry.url);

    // Went from profile page to homepage
    // ~> Set VT names on the relevant list item
    if (isProfilePage(fromUrl) && isHomePage(currentUrl)) {
      const profile = extractProfileNameFromUrl(fromUrl);

      // Set view-transition-name values on the elements to animate
      document.querySelector(`#${profile} span`).style.viewTransitionName =
        "name";
      document.querySelector(`#${profile} img`).style.viewTransitionName =
        "avatar";

      // Remove names after snapshots have been taken
      // so that we're ready for the next navigation
      await e.viewTransition.ready;
      document.querySelector(`#${profile} span`).style.viewTransitionName =
        "none";
      document.querySelector(`#${profile} img`).style.viewTransitionName =
        "none";
    }

    // Went to profile page
    // ~> Set VT names on the main title and image
    if (isProfilePage(currentUrl)) {
      // Set view-transition-name values on the elements to animate
      document.querySelector(`#detail main h1`).style.viewTransitionName =
        "name";
      document.querySelector(`#detail main img`).style.viewTransitionName =
        "avatar";

      // Remove names after snapshots have been taken
      // so that we're ready for the next navigation
      await e.viewTransition.ready;
      document.querySelector(`#detail main h1`).style.viewTransitionName =
        "none";
      document.querySelector(`#detail main img`).style.viewTransitionName =
        "none";
    }
  }
});
Stabilizing page state to make cross-document transitions consistentBefore running a cross-document transition, you ideally want to wait until the state of the page stabilizes, relying on render blocking to ensure that:

Critical styles are loaded and applied.
Critical scripts are loaded and run.
The HTML visible for the user's initial view of the page has been parsed, so it renders consistently.

Styles are render blocked by default, and scripts can be render blocked using the blocking="render" attribute.
To ensure that your initial HTML has been parsed and will always render consistently before the transition animation runs, you can use <link rel="expect">. In this element, you include the following attributes:

rel="expect" to indicate that you want to use this <link> element to render block some HTML on the page.
href="#element-id" to indicate the ID of the element you want to render block.
blocking="render" to render block the specified HTML.

Let's explore what this looks like with an example HTML document:
html<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <!-- This will be render-blocking by default -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />

    <!-- Marking critical scripts as render blocking will
         ensure they're run before the view transition is activated -->
    <script async href="layout.js" blocking="render"></script>

    <!-- Use rel="expect" and blocking="render" to ensure the
         #lead-content element is visible and fully parsed before
         activating the transition -->
    <link rel="expect" href="#lead-content" blocking="render" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Page title</h1>
    <nav>...</nav>
    <div id="lead-content">
      <section id="first-section">The first section</section>
      <section>The second section</section>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>

The result is that document rendering is blocked until the lead content <div> has been parsed, ensuring a consistent view transition.
You can also specify a media attribute on <link rel="expect"> elements. For example, you might want to block rendering on a smaller amount of content when loading the page on a narrow-screen device, than on a wide-screen device. This makes sense — on a mobile, less content will be visible when the page first loads than in the case of a desktop.
This could be achieved with the following HTML:
html<link
  rel="expect"
  href="#lead-content"
  blocking="render"
  media="screen and (min-width: 641px)" />
<link
  rel="expect"
  href="#first-section"
  blocking="render"
  media="screen and (max-width: 640px)" />\n\nUsing the View Transition APIThis article explains the theory behind how the View Transition API works, how to create view transitions and customize the transition animations, and how to manipulate active view transitions. This covers view transitions for both DOM state updates in a single-page app (SPA), and navigating between documents in a multi-page app (MPA).The view transition processLet's walk through the process by which a view transition works:


A view transition is triggered. How this is done depends on the type of view transition:

In the case of same-document transitions (SPAs), a view transition is triggered by passing the function that would trigger the view change DOM update as a callback to the document.startViewTransition() method.
In the case of cross-document transitions (MPAs), a view transition is triggered by initiating navigation to a new document. Both the current and destination documents of the navigation need to be on the same origin, and opt-in to the view transition by including a @view-transition at rule in their CSS with a navigation descriptor of auto.

Note:
An active view transition has an associated ViewTransition instance (for example, returned by startViewTransition() in the case of same-document (SPA) transitions). The ViewTransition object includes several promises, allowing you to run code in response to different parts of the view transition process being reached. See Controlling view transitions with JavaScript for more information.





On the current (old page) view, the API captures snapshots of elements that have a view-transition-name declared on them.


The view change occurs:


In the case of same-document transitions (SPAs), the callback passed to startViewTransition() is invoked, which causes the DOM to change.
When the callback has run successfully, the ViewTransition.updateCallbackDone promise fulfills, allowing you to respond to the DOM updating.


In the case of cross-document transitions (MPAs), the navigation occurs between the current and destination documents.




The API captures snapshots from the new view as a live representation.
At this point, the view transition is about to run, and the ViewTransition.ready promise fulfills, allowing you to respond by running a custom JavaScript animation instead of the default, for example.


The old page snapshots animate "out", while the new view snapshots animate "in". By default, the old view snapshots animate from opacity 1 to 0, and the new view snapshots animate from opacity 0 to 1, which creates a cross-fade.


When the transition animations have reached their end states, the ViewTransition.finished promise fulfills, allowing you to respond.



Note:
If the document's page visibility state is hidden (for example if the document is obscured by a window, the browser is minimized, or another browser tab is active) during a document.startViewTransition() call, the view transition is skipped entirely.
The view transition pseudo-element treeTo handle creating the outbound and inbound transition animations, the API constructs a pseudo-element tree with the following structure:
::view-transition
└─ ::view-transition-group(root)
  └─ ::view-transition-image-pair(root)
      ├─ ::view-transition-old(root)
      └─ ::view-transition-new(root)


Note:
A ::view-transition-group subtree is created for every captured view-transition-name.

In the case of same-document transitions (SPAs), the pseudo-element tree is made available in the document. In the case of cross-document transitions (MPAs), the pseudo-element tree is made available in the destination document only.
The most interesting parts of the tree structure are as follows:


::view-transition is the root of view transitions overlay, which contains all view transition snapshot groups and sits over the top of all other page content.


A ::view-transition-group acts as a container for each view transition snapshot group. The root argument specifies the default snapshot group — the view transition animation will apply to the snapshot whose view-transition-name is root. By default, this is the :root element, because the default browser styles define this:
css:root {
  view-transition-name: root;
}

Be aware however that page authors can change this by unsetting the above, and setting view-transition-name: root on a different element.


::view-transition-old targets the static snapshot of the old page element, and ::view-transition-new targets the live snapshot of the new page element. Both of these render as replaced content, in the same manner as an <img> or <video>, meaning that they can be styled with handy properties like object-fit and object-position.



Note:
It is possible to target different DOM elements with different custom view transition animations by setting a different view-transition-name on each one. In such cases, a ::view-transition-group is created for each one. See Different animations for different elements for an example.


Note:
As you'll see later, to customize the outbound and inbound animations you need to target the ::view-transition-old and ::view-transition-new pseudo-elements with your animations, respectively.
Creating a basic view transitionThis section illustrates how to create a basic view transition, in both the SPA and MPA case.Basic SPA view transitionAs an example, an SPA may include functionality to fetch new content and update the DOM in response to an event of some kind, such as a navigation link being clicked or an update being pushed from the server. In our View Transitions SPA demo we've simplified this to a displayNewImage() function that shows a new full-size image based on the thumbnail that was clicked. We've encapsulated this inside an updateView() function that only calls the View Transition API if the browser supports it:
jsfunction updateView(event) {
  // Handle the difference in whether the event is fired on the <a> or the <img>
  const targetIdentifier = event.target.firstChild || event.target;

  const displayNewImage = () => {
    const mainSrc = `${targetIdentifier.src.split("_th.jpg")[0]}.jpg`;
    galleryImg.src = mainSrc;
    galleryCaption.textContent = targetIdentifier.alt;
  };

  // Fallback for browsers that don't support View Transitions:
  if (!document.startViewTransition) {
    displayNewImage();
    return;
  }

  // With View Transitions:
  const transition = document.startViewTransition(() => displayNewImage());
}

This code is enough to handle the transition between displayed images. Supporting browsers will show the change from old to new images and captions as a smooth cross-fade (the default view transition). It will still work in non-supporting browsers but without the nice animation.Basic MPA view transitionWhen creating a cross-document (MPA) view transition, the process is even simpler than for SPAs. No JavaScript is required, as the view update is triggered by a cross-document, same-origin navigation rather than a JavaScript-initiated DOM change. To enable a basic MPA view transition, you need to specify a @view-transition at-rule in the CSS for both the current and destination documents to opt them in, like so:
css@view-transition {
  navigation: auto;
}

Our View Transitions MPA demo shows this at-rule in action, and additionally demonstrates how to customize the outbound and inbound animations of the view transition.

Note:
Currently MPA view transitions can only be created between same-origin documents, but this restriction may be relaxed in future implementations.
Customizing your animationsThe View Transitions pseudo-elements have default CSS Animations applied (which are detailed in their reference pages).
Most appearance transitions are given a default smooth cross-fade animation, as mentioned above. There are some exceptions:

height and width transitions have a smooth scaling animation applied.
position and transform transitions have a smooth movement animation applied.

You can modify the default animations in any way you want using regular CSS — target the "from" animation with ::view-transition-old, and the "to" animation with ::view-transition-new.
For example, to change the speed of both:
css::view-transition-old(root),
::view-transition-new(root) {
  animation-duration: 0.5s;
}

It is recommended that you target the ::view-transition-group() with such styles in cases where you want to apply them to ::view-transition-old() and ::view-transition-new(). Because of the pseudo-element hierarchy and default user-agent styling, the styles will be inherited by both. For example:
css::view-transition-group(root) {
  animation-duration: 0.5s;
}


Note:
This is also a good option for safeguarding your code — ::view-transition-group() also animates and you could end up with different durations for the group/image-pair pseudo-elements versus the old and new pseudo-elements.

In the case of cross-document (MPA) transitions, the pseudo-elements need to be included in the destination document only for the view transition to work. If you want to use the view transition in both directions, you'll need to include it in both, of course.
Our View Transitions MPA demo includes the above CSS, but takes the customization a step further, defining custom animations and applying them to the ::view-transition-old(root) and ::view-transition-new(root) pseudo-elements. The result is that the default cross-fade transition is swapped out for a "swipe up" transition when navigation occurs:
css/* Create a custom animation */

@keyframes move-out {
  from {
    transform: translateY(0%);
  }

  to {
    transform: translateY(-100%);
  }
}

@keyframes move-in {
  from {
    transform: translateY(100%);
  }

  to {
    transform: translateY(0%);
  }
}

/* Apply the custom animation to the old and new page states */

::view-transition-old(root) {
  animation: 0.4s ease-in both move-out;
}

::view-transition-new(root) {
  animation: 0.4s ease-in both move-in;
}
Different animations for different elementsBy default, all of the different elements that change during the view update are transitioned using the same animation. If you want some elements to animate differently from the default root animation, you can separate them out using the view-transition-name property. For example, in our View Transitions SPA demo the <figcaption> elements are given a view-transition-name of figure-caption to separate them from the rest of the page in terms of view transitions:
cssfigcaption {
  view-transition-name: figure-caption;
}

With this CSS applied, the generated pseudo-element tree will now look like this:
::view-transition
├─ ::view-transition-group(root)
│ └─ ::view-transition-image-pair(root)
│     ├─ ::view-transition-old(root)
│     └─ ::view-transition-new(root)
└─ ::view-transition-group(figure-caption)
  └─ ::view-transition-image-pair(figure-caption)
      ├─ ::view-transition-old(figure-caption)
      └─ ::view-transition-new(figure-caption)

The existence of the second set of pseudo-elements allows separate view transition styling to be applied just to the <figcaption>. The different old and new view captures are handled separately from one another.

Note:
The value of view-transition-name can be anything you want except for none — the none value specifically means that the element will not participate in a view transition.
view-transition-name values must also be unique. If two rendered elements have the same view-transition-name at the same time, ViewTransition.ready will reject and the transition will be skipped.

The following code applies a custom animation just to the <figcaption>:
css@keyframes grow-x {
  from {
    transform: scaleX(0);
  }
  to {
    transform: scaleX(1);
  }
}

@keyframes shrink-x {
  from {
    transform: scaleX(1);
  }
  to {
    transform: scaleX(0);
  }
}

::view-transition-group(figure-caption) {
  height: auto;
  right: 0;
  left: auto;
  transform-origin: right center;
}

::view-transition-old(figure-caption) {
  animation: 0.25s linear both shrink-x;
}

::view-transition-new(figure-caption) {
  animation: 0.25s 0.25s linear both grow-x;
}

Here we've created a custom CSS animation and applied it to the ::view-transition-old(figure-caption) and ::view-transition-new(figure-caption) pseudo-elements. We've also added a number of other styles to both to keep them in the same place and stop the default styling from interfering with our custom animations.

Note:
You can use * as the identifier in a pseudo-element to target all snapshot pseudo-elements, regardless of what name they have. For example:
css::view-transition-group(*) {
  animation-duration: 2s;
}

Taking advantage of the default animation stylesNote that we also discovered another transition option that is simpler and produced a nicer result than the above. Our final <figcaption> view transition ended up looking like this:
cssfigcaption {
  view-transition-name: figure-caption;
}

::view-transition-group(figure-caption) {
  height: 100%;
}

This works because, by default, ::view-transition-group transitions width and height between the old and new views with a smooth scale. We just needed to set a fixed height on both states to make it work.

Note: Smooth transitions with the View Transition API contains several other customization examples.
Controlling view transitions with JavaScriptA view transition has an associated ViewTransition object instance, which contains several promise members allowing you to run JavaScript in response to different states of the transition being reached. For example, ViewTransition.ready fulfills once the pseudo-element tree is created and the animation is about to start, whereas ViewTransition.finished fulfills once the animation is finished, and the new page view is visible and interactive to the user.
The ViewTransition can be accessed like so:


In the case of same-document (SPA) transitions, the document.startViewTransition() method returns the ViewTransition associated with the transition.


In the case of cross-document (MPA) transitions:

A pageswap event is fired when a document is about to be unloaded due to a navigation. Its event object (PageSwapEvent) provides access to the ViewTransition via the PageSwapEvent.viewTransition property, as well as a NavigationActivation via PageSwapEvent.activation containing the navigation type and current and destination document history entries.

Note:
If the navigation has a cross-origin URL anywhere in the redirect chain, the activation property returns null.


A pagereveal event is fired when a document is first rendered, either when loading a fresh document from the network or activating a document (either from back/forward cache (bfcache) or prerender). Its event object (PageRevealEvent) provides access to the ViewTransition via the PageRevealEvent.viewTransition property.



Let's have a look at some example code to show how these features could be used.A JavaScript-powered custom same-document (SPA) transitionThe following JavaScript could be used to create a circular reveal view transition emanating from the position of the user's cursor on click, with animation provided by the Web Animations API.
js// Store the last click event
let lastClick;
addEventListener("click", (event) => (lastClick = event));

function spaNavigate(data) {
  // Fallback for browsers that don't support this API:
  if (!document.startViewTransition) {
    updateTheDOMSomehow(data);
    return;
  }

  // Get the click position, or fallback to the middle of the screen
  const x = lastClick?.clientX ?? innerWidth / 2;
  const y = lastClick?.clientY ?? innerHeight / 2;
  // Get the distance to the furthest corner
  const endRadius = Math.hypot(
    Math.max(x, innerWidth - x),
    Math.max(y, innerHeight - y),
  );

  // Create a transition:
  const transition = document.startViewTransition(() => {
    updateTheDOMSomehow(data);
  });

  // Wait for the pseudo-elements to be created:
  transition.ready.then(() => {
    // Animate the root's new view
    document.documentElement.animate(
      {
        clipPath: [
          `circle(0 at ${x}px ${y}px)`,
          `circle(${endRadius}px at ${x}px ${y}px)`,
        ],
      },
      {
        duration: 500,
        easing: "ease-in",
        // Specify which pseudo-element to animate
        pseudoElement: "::view-transition-new(root)",
      },
    );
  });
}

This animation also requires the following CSS, to turn off the default CSS animation and stop the old and new view states from blending in any way (the new state "wipes" right over the top of the old state, rather than transitioning in):
css::view-transition-image-pair(root) {
  isolation: auto;
}

::view-transition-old(root),
::view-transition-new(root) {
  animation: none;
  mix-blend-mode: normal;
  display: block;
}
A JavaScript-powered custom cross-document (MPA) transitionThe List of Chrome DevRel team members demo provides a basic set of team profile pages, and demonstrates how to use the pageswap and pagereveal events to customize the outgoing and inbound animations of a cross-document view transition based on the "from" and "to" URLs.
The pageswap event listener looks as follows. This sets view transition names on the elements on the outbound page that link to the profile pages. When navigating from the home page to a profile page, custom animations are provided only for the linked element that is clicked in each case.
jswindow.addEventListener("pageswap", async (e) => {
  // Only run this if an active view transition exists
  if (e.viewTransition) {
    const currentUrl = e.activation.from?.url
      ? new URL(e.activation.from.url)
      : null;
    const targetUrl = new URL(e.activation.entry.url);

    // Going from profile page to homepage
    // ~> The big img and title are the ones!
    if (isProfilePage(currentUrl) && isHomePage(targetUrl)) {
      // Set view-transition-name values on the elements to animate
      document.querySelector(`#detail main h1`).style.viewTransitionName =
        "name";
      document.querySelector(`#detail main img`).style.viewTransitionName =
        "avatar";

      // Remove view-transition-names after snapshots have been taken
      // Stops naming conflicts resulting from the page state persisting in BFCache
      await e.viewTransition.finished;
      document.querySelector(`#detail main h1`).style.viewTransitionName =
        "none";
      document.querySelector(`#detail main img`).style.viewTransitionName =
        "none";
    }

    // Going to profile page
    // ~> The clicked items are the ones!
    if (isProfilePage(targetUrl)) {
      const profile = extractProfileNameFromUrl(targetUrl);

      // Set view-transition-name values on the elements to animate
      document.querySelector(`#${profile} span`).style.viewTransitionName =
        "name";
      document.querySelector(`#${profile} img`).style.viewTransitionName =
        "avatar";

      // Remove view-transition-names after snapshots have been taken
      // Stops naming conflicts resulting from the page state persisting in BFCache
      await e.viewTransition.finished;
      document.querySelector(`#${profile} span`).style.viewTransitionName =
        "none";
      document.querySelector(`#${profile} img`).style.viewTransitionName =
        "none";
    }
  }
});


Note:
We remove the view-transition-name values after snapshots have been taken in each case. If we left them set, they would persist in the page state saved in the bfcache upon navigation. If the back button was then pressed, the pagereveal event handler of the page being navigated back to would then attempt to set the same view-transition-name values on different elements. If multiple elements have the same view-transition-name set, the view transition is skipped.

The pagereveal event listener looks as follows. This works in a similar way to the pageswap event listener, although bear in mind that here we are customizing the "to" animation, for page elements on the new page.
jswindow.addEventListener("pagereveal", async (e) => {
  // If the "from" history entry does not exist, return
  if (!navigation.activation.from) return;

  // Only run this if an active view transition exists
  if (e.viewTransition) {
    const fromUrl = new URL(navigation.activation.from.url);
    const currentUrl = new URL(navigation.activation.entry.url);

    // Went from profile page to homepage
    // ~> Set VT names on the relevant list item
    if (isProfilePage(fromUrl) && isHomePage(currentUrl)) {
      const profile = extractProfileNameFromUrl(fromUrl);

      // Set view-transition-name values on the elements to animate
      document.querySelector(`#${profile} span`).style.viewTransitionName =
        "name";
      document.querySelector(`#${profile} img`).style.viewTransitionName =
        "avatar";

      // Remove names after snapshots have been taken
      // so that we're ready for the next navigation
      await e.viewTransition.ready;
      document.querySelector(`#${profile} span`).style.viewTransitionName =
        "none";
      document.querySelector(`#${profile} img`).style.viewTransitionName =
        "none";
    }

    // Went to profile page
    // ~> Set VT names on the main title and image
    if (isProfilePage(currentUrl)) {
      // Set view-transition-name values on the elements to animate
      document.querySelector(`#detail main h1`).style.viewTransitionName =
        "name";
      document.querySelector(`#detail main img`).style.viewTransitionName =
        "avatar";

      // Remove names after snapshots have been taken
      // so that we're ready for the next navigation
      await e.viewTransition.ready;
      document.querySelector(`#detail main h1`).style.viewTransitionName =
        "none";
      document.querySelector(`#detail main img`).style.viewTransitionName =
        "none";
    }
  }
});
Stabilizing page state to make cross-document transitions consistentBefore running a cross-document transition, you ideally want to wait until the state of the page stabilizes, relying on render blocking to ensure that:

Critical styles are loaded and applied.
Critical scripts are loaded and run.
The HTML visible for the user's initial view of the page has been parsed, so it renders consistently.

Styles are render blocked by default, and scripts can be render blocked using the blocking="render" attribute.
To ensure that your initial HTML has been parsed and will always render consistently before the transition animation runs, you can use <link rel="expect">. In this element, you include the following attributes:

rel="expect" to indicate that you want to use this <link> element to render block some HTML on the page.
href="#element-id" to indicate the ID of the element you want to render block.
blocking="render" to render block the specified HTML.

Let's explore what this looks like with an example HTML document:
html<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <!-- This will be render-blocking by default -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />

    <!-- Marking critical scripts as render blocking will
         ensure they're run before the view transition is activated -->
    <script async href="layout.js" blocking="render"></script>

    <!-- Use rel="expect" and blocking="render" to ensure the
         #lead-content element is visible and fully parsed before
         activating the transition -->
    <link rel="expect" href="#lead-content" blocking="render" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Page title</h1>
    <nav>...</nav>
    <div id="lead-content">
      <section id="first-section">The first section</section>
      <section>The second section</section>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>

The result is that document rendering is blocked until the lead content <div> has been parsed, ensuring a consistent view transition.
You can also specify a media attribute on <link rel="expect"> elements. For example, you might want to block rendering on a smaller amount of content when loading the page on a narrow-screen device, than on a wide-screen device. This makes sense — on a mobile, less content will be visible when the page first loads than in the case of a desktop.
This could be achieved with the following HTML:
html<link
  rel="expect"
  href="#lead-content"
  blocking="render"
  media="screen and (min-width: 641px)" />
<link
  rel="expect"
  href="#first-section"
  blocking="render"
  media="screen and (max-width: 640px)" />

This covers view transitions for both DOM state updates in a single-page app (SPA), and navigating between documents in a multi-page app (MPA).The view transition processLet's walk through the process by which a view transition works:


A view transition is triggered. How this is done depends on the type of view transition:

In the case of same-document transitions (SPAs), a view transition is triggered by passing the function that would trigger the view change DOM update as a callback to the document.startViewTransition() method.
In the case of cross-document transitions (MPAs), a view transition is triggered by initiating navigation to a new document. Both the current and destination documents of the navigation need to be on the same origin, and opt-in to the view transition by including a @view-transition at rule in their CSS with a navigation descriptor of auto.

Note:
An active view transition has an associated ViewTransition instance (for example, returned by startViewTransition() in the case of same-document (SPA) transitions). The ViewTransition object includes several promises, allowing you to run code in response to different parts of the view transition process being reached. See Controlling view transitions with JavaScript for more information.





On the current (old page) view, the API captures snapshots of elements that have a view-transition-name declared on them.


The view change occurs:


In the case of same-document transitions (SPAs), the callback passed to startViewTransition() is invoked, which causes the DOM to change.
When the callback has run successfully, the ViewTransition.updateCallbackDone promise fulfills, allowing you to respond to the DOM updating.


In the case of cross-document transitions (MPAs), the navigation occurs between the current and destination documents.




The API captures snapshots from the new view as a live representation.
At this point, the view transition is about to run, and the ViewTransition.ready promise fulfills, allowing you to respond by running a custom JavaScript animation instead of the default, for example.


The old page snapshots animate "out", while the new view snapshots animate "in". By default, the old view snapshots animate from opacity 1 to 0, and the new view snapshots animate from opacity 0 to 1, which creates a cross-fade.


When the transition animations have reached their end states, the ViewTransition.finished promise fulfills, allowing you to respond.



Note:
If the document's page visibility state is hidden (for example if the document is obscured by a window, the browser is minimized, or another browser tab is active) during a document.startViewTransition() call, the view transition is skipped entirely.
The view transition pseudo-element treeTo handle creating the outbound and inbound transition animations, the API constructs a pseudo-element tree with the following structure:
::view-transition
└─ ::view-transition-group(root)
  └─ ::view-transition-image-pair(root)
      ├─ ::view-transition-old(root)
      └─ ::view-transition-new(root)


Note:
A ::view-transition-group subtree is created for every captured view-transition-name.

In the case of same-document transitions (SPAs), the pseudo-element tree is made available in the document. In the case of cross-document transitions (MPAs), the pseudo-element tree is made available in the destination document only.
The most interesting parts of the tree structure are as follows:


::view-transition is the root of view transitions overlay, which contains all view transition snapshot groups and sits over the top of all other page content.


A ::view-transition-group acts as a container for each view transition snapshot group. The root argument specifies the default snapshot group — the view transition animation will apply to the snapshot whose view-transition-name is root. By default, this is the :root element, because the default browser styles define this:
css:root {
  view-transition-name: root;
}

Be aware however that page authors can change this by unsetting the above, and setting view-transition-name: root on a different element.


::view-transition-old targets the static snapshot of the old page element, and ::view-transition-new targets the live snapshot of the new page element. Both of these render as replaced content, in the same manner as an <img> or <video>, meaning that they can be styled with handy properties like object-fit and object-position.



Note:
It is possible to target different DOM elements with different custom view transition animations by setting a different view-transition-name on each one. In such cases, a ::view-transition-group is created for each one. See Different animations for different elements for an example.


Note:
As you'll see later, to customize the outbound and inbound animations you need to target the ::view-transition-old and ::view-transition-new pseudo-elements with your animations, respectively.
Creating a basic view transitionThis section illustrates how to create a basic view transition, in both the SPA and MPA case.Basic SPA view transitionAs an example, an SPA may include functionality to fetch new content and update the DOM in response to an event of some kind, such as a navigation link being clicked or an update being pushed from the server. In our View Transitions SPA demo we've simplified this to a displayNewImage() function that shows a new full-size image based on the thumbnail that was clicked. We've encapsulated this inside an updateView() function that only calls the View Transition API if the browser supports it:
jsfunction updateView(event) {
  // Handle the difference in whether the event is fired on the <a> or the <img>
  const targetIdentifier = event.target.firstChild || event.target;

  const displayNewImage = () => {
    const mainSrc = `${targetIdentifier.src.split("_th.jpg")[0]}.jpg`;
    galleryImg.src = mainSrc;
    galleryCaption.textContent = targetIdentifier.alt;
  };

  // Fallback for browsers that don't support View Transitions:
  if (!document.startViewTransition) {
    displayNewImage();
    return;
  }

  // With View Transitions:
  const transition = document.startViewTransition(() => displayNewImage());
}

This code is enough to handle the transition between displayed images. Supporting browsers will show the change from old to new images and captions as a smooth cross-fade (the default view transition). It will still work in non-supporting browsers but without the nice animation.Basic MPA view transitionWhen creating a cross-document (MPA) view transition, the process is even simpler than for SPAs. No JavaScript is required, as the view update is triggered by a cross-document, same-origin navigation rather than a JavaScript-initiated DOM change. To enable a basic MPA view transition, you need to specify a @view-transition at-rule in the CSS for both the current and destination documents to opt them in, like so:
css@view-transition {
  navigation: auto;
}

Our View Transitions MPA demo shows this at-rule in action, and additionally demonstrates how to customize the outbound and inbound animations of the view transition.

Note:
Currently MPA view transitions can only be created between same-origin documents, but this restriction may be relaxed in future implementations.
Customizing your animationsThe View Transitions pseudo-elements have default CSS Animations applied (which are detailed in their reference pages).
Most appearance transitions are given a default smooth cross-fade animation, as mentioned above. There are some exceptions:

height and width transitions have a smooth scaling animation applied.
position and transform transitions have a smooth movement animation applied.

You can modify the default animations in any way you want using regular CSS — target the "from" animation with ::view-transition-old, and the "to" animation with ::view-transition-new.
For example, to change the speed of both:
css::view-transition-old(root),
::view-transition-new(root) {
  animation-duration: 0.5s;
}

It is recommended that you target the ::view-transition-group() with such styles in cases where you want to apply them to ::view-transition-old() and ::view-transition-new(). Because of the pseudo-element hierarchy and default user-agent styling, the styles will be inherited by both. For example:
css::view-transition-group(root) {
  animation-duration: 0.5s;
}


Note:
This is also a good option for safeguarding your code — ::view-transition-group() also animates and you could end up with different durations for the group/image-pair pseudo-elements versus the old and new pseudo-elements.

In the case of cross-document (MPA) transitions, the pseudo-elements need to be included in the destination document only for the view transition to work. If you want to use the view transition in both directions, you'll need to include it in both, of course.
Our View Transitions MPA demo includes the above CSS, but takes the customization a step further, defining custom animations and applying them to the ::view-transition-old(root) and ::view-transition-new(root) pseudo-elements. The result is that the default cross-fade transition is swapped out for a "swipe up" transition when navigation occurs:
css/* Create a custom animation */

@keyframes move-out {
  from {
    transform: translateY(0%);
  }

  to {
    transform: translateY(-100%);
  }
}

@keyframes move-in {
  from {
    transform: translateY(100%);
  }

  to {
    transform: translateY(0%);
  }
}

/* Apply the custom animation to the old and new page states */

::view-transition-old(root) {
  animation: 0.4s ease-in both move-out;
}

::view-transition-new(root) {
  animation: 0.4s ease-in both move-in;
}
Different animations for different elementsBy default, all of the different elements that change during the view update are transitioned using the same animation. If you want some elements to animate differently from the default root animation, you can separate them out using the view-transition-name property. For example, in our View Transitions SPA demo the <figcaption> elements are given a view-transition-name of figure-caption to separate them from the rest of the page in terms of view transitions:
cssfigcaption {
  view-transition-name: figure-caption;
}

With this CSS applied, the generated pseudo-element tree will now look like this:
::view-transition
├─ ::view-transition-group(root)
│ └─ ::view-transition-image-pair(root)
│     ├─ ::view-transition-old(root)
│     └─ ::view-transition-new(root)
└─ ::view-transition-group(figure-caption)
  └─ ::view-transition-image-pair(figure-caption)
      ├─ ::view-transition-old(figure-caption)
      └─ ::view-transition-new(figure-caption)

The existence of the second set of pseudo-elements allows separate view transition styling to be applied just to the <figcaption>. The different old and new view captures are handled separately from one another.

Note:
The value of view-transition-name can be anything you want except for none — the none value specifically means that the element will not participate in a view transition.
view-transition-name values must also be unique. If two rendered elements have the same view-transition-name at the same time, ViewTransition.ready will reject and the transition will be skipped.

The following code applies a custom animation just to the <figcaption>:
css@keyframes grow-x {
  from {
    transform: scaleX(0);
  }
  to {
    transform: scaleX(1);
  }
}

@keyframes shrink-x {
  from {
    transform: scaleX(1);
  }
  to {
    transform: scaleX(0);
  }
}

::view-transition-group(figure-caption) {
  height: auto;
  right: 0;
  left: auto;
  transform-origin: right center;
}

::view-transition-old(figure-caption) {
  animation: 0.25s linear both shrink-x;
}

::view-transition-new(figure-caption) {
  animation: 0.25s 0.25s linear both grow-x;
}

Here we've created a custom CSS animation and applied it to the ::view-transition-old(figure-caption) and ::view-transition-new(figure-caption) pseudo-elements. We've also added a number of other styles to both to keep them in the same place and stop the default styling from interfering with our custom animations.

Note:
You can use * as the identifier in a pseudo-element to target all snapshot pseudo-elements, regardless of what name they have. For example:
css::view-transition-group(*) {
  animation-duration: 2s;
}

Taking advantage of the default animation stylesNote that we also discovered another transition option that is simpler and produced a nicer result than the above. Our final <figcaption> view transition ended up looking like this:
cssfigcaption {
  view-transition-name: figure-caption;
}

::view-transition-group(figure-caption) {
  height: 100%;
}

This works because, by default, ::view-transition-group transitions width and height between the old and new views with a smooth scale. We just needed to set a fixed height on both states to make it work.

Note: Smooth transitions with the View Transition API contains several other customization examples.
Controlling view transitions with JavaScriptA view transition has an associated ViewTransition object instance, which contains several promise members allowing you to run JavaScript in response to different states of the transition being reached. For example, ViewTransition.ready fulfills once the pseudo-element tree is created and the animation is about to start, whereas ViewTransition.finished fulfills once the animation is finished, and the new page view is visible and interactive to the user.
The ViewTransition can be accessed like so:


In the case of same-document (SPA) transitions, the document.startViewTransition() method returns the ViewTransition associated with the transition.


In the case of cross-document (MPA) transitions:

A pageswap event is fired when a document is about to be unloaded due to a navigation. Its event object (PageSwapEvent) provides access to the ViewTransition via the PageSwapEvent.viewTransition property, as well as a NavigationActivation via PageSwapEvent.activation containing the navigation type and current and destination document history entries.

Note:
If the navigation has a cross-origin URL anywhere in the redirect chain, the activation property returns null.


A pagereveal event is fired when a document is first rendered, either when loading a fresh document from the network or activating a document (either from back/forward cache (bfcache) or prerender). Its event object (PageRevealEvent) provides access to the ViewTransition via the PageRevealEvent.viewTransition property.



Let's have a look at some example code to show how these features could be used.A JavaScript-powered custom same-document (SPA) transitionThe following JavaScript could be used to create a circular reveal view transition emanating from the position of the user's cursor on click, with animation provided by the Web Animations API.
js// Store the last click event
let lastClick;
addEventListener("click", (event) => (lastClick = event));

function spaNavigate(data) {
  // Fallback for browsers that don't support this API:
  if (!document.startViewTransition) {
    updateTheDOMSomehow(data);
    return;
  }

  // Get the click position, or fallback to the middle of the screen
  const x = lastClick?.clientX ?? innerWidth / 2;
  const y = lastClick?.clientY ?? innerHeight / 2;
  // Get the distance to the furthest corner
  const endRadius = Math.hypot(
    Math.max(x, innerWidth - x),
    Math.max(y, innerHeight - y),
  );

  // Create a transition:
  const transition = document.startViewTransition(() => {
    updateTheDOMSomehow(data);
  });

  // Wait for the pseudo-elements to be created:
  transition.ready.then(() => {
    // Animate the root's new view
    document.documentElement.animate(
      {
        clipPath: [
          `circle(0 at ${x}px ${y}px)`,
          `circle(${endRadius}px at ${x}px ${y}px)`,
        ],
      },
      {
        duration: 500,
        easing: "ease-in",
        // Specify which pseudo-element to animate
        pseudoElement: "::view-transition-new(root)",
      },
    );
  });
}

This animation also requires the following CSS, to turn off the default CSS animation and stop the old and new view states from blending in any way (the new state "wipes" right over the top of the old state, rather than transitioning in):
css::view-transition-image-pair(root) {
  isolation: auto;
}

::view-transition-old(root),
::view-transition-new(root) {
  animation: none;
  mix-blend-mode: normal;
  display: block;
}
A JavaScript-powered custom cross-document (MPA) transitionThe List of Chrome DevRel team members demo provides a basic set of team profile pages, and demonstrates how to use the pageswap and pagereveal events to customize the outgoing and inbound animations of a cross-document view transition based on the "from" and "to" URLs.
The pageswap event listener looks as follows. This sets view transition names on the elements on the outbound page that link to the profile pages. When navigating from the home page to a profile page, custom animations are provided only for the linked element that is clicked in each case.
jswindow.addEventListener("pageswap", async (e) => {
  // Only run this if an active view transition exists
  if (e.viewTransition) {
    const currentUrl = e.activation.from?.url
      ? new URL(e.activation.from.url)
      : null;
    const targetUrl = new URL(e.activation.entry.url);

    // Going from profile page to homepage
    // ~> The big img and title are the ones!
    if (isProfilePage(currentUrl) && isHomePage(targetUrl)) {
      // Set view-transition-name values on the elements to animate
      document.querySelector(`#detail main h1`).style.viewTransitionName =
        "name";
      document.querySelector(`#detail main img`).style.viewTransitionName =
        "avatar";

      // Remove view-transition-names after snapshots have been taken
      // Stops naming conflicts resulting from the page state persisting in BFCache
      await e.viewTransition.finished;
      document.querySelector(`#detail main h1`).style.viewTransitionName =
        "none";
      document.querySelector(`#detail main img`).style.viewTransitionName =
        "none";
    }

    // Going to profile page
    // ~> The clicked items are the ones!
    if (isProfilePage(targetUrl)) {
      const profile = extractProfileNameFromUrl(targetUrl);

      // Set view-transition-name values on the elements to animate
      document.querySelector(`#${profile} span`).style.viewTransitionName =
        "name";
      document.querySelector(`#${profile} img`).style.viewTransitionName =
        "avatar";

      // Remove view-transition-names after snapshots have been taken
      // Stops naming conflicts resulting from the page state persisting in BFCache
      await e.viewTransition.finished;
      document.querySelector(`#${profile} span`).style.viewTransitionName =
        "none";
      document.querySelector(`#${profile} img`).style.viewTransitionName =
        "none";
    }
  }
});


Note:
We remove the view-transition-name values after snapshots have been taken in each case. If we left them set, they would persist in the page state saved in the bfcache upon navigation. If the back button was then pressed, the pagereveal event handler of the page being navigated back to would then attempt to set the same view-transition-name values on different elements. If multiple elements have the same view-transition-name set, the view transition is skipped.

The pagereveal event listener looks as follows. This works in a similar way to the pageswap event listener, although bear in mind that here we are customizing the "to" animation, for page elements on the new page.
jswindow.addEventListener("pagereveal", async (e) => {
  // If the "from" history entry does not exist, return
  if (!navigation.activation.from) return;

  // Only run this if an active view transition exists
  if (e.viewTransition) {
    const fromUrl = new URL(navigation.activation.from.url);
    const currentUrl = new URL(navigation.activation.entry.url);

    // Went from profile page to homepage
    // ~> Set VT names on the relevant list item
    if (isProfilePage(fromUrl) && isHomePage(currentUrl)) {
      const profile = extractProfileNameFromUrl(fromUrl);

      // Set view-transition-name values on the elements to animate
      document.querySelector(`#${profile} span`).style.viewTransitionName =
        "name";
      document.querySelector(`#${profile} img`).style.viewTransitionName =
        "avatar";

      // Remove names after snapshots have been taken
      // so that we're ready for the next navigation
      await e.viewTransition.ready;
      document.querySelector(`#${profile} span`).style.viewTransitionName =
        "none";
      document.querySelector(`#${profile} img`).style.viewTransitionName =
        "none";
    }

    // Went to profile page
    // ~> Set VT names on the main title and image
    if (isProfilePage(currentUrl)) {
      // Set view-transition-name values on the elements to animate
      document.querySelector(`#detail main h1`).style.viewTransitionName =
        "name";
      document.querySelector(`#detail main img`).style.viewTransitionName =
        "avatar";

      // Remove names after snapshots have been taken
      // so that we're ready for the next navigation
      await e.viewTransition.ready;
      document.querySelector(`#detail main h1`).style.viewTransitionName =
        "none";
      document.querySelector(`#detail main img`).style.viewTransitionName =
        "none";
    }
  }
});
Stabilizing page state to make cross-document transitions consistentBefore running a cross-document transition, you ideally want to wait until the state of the page stabilizes, relying on render blocking to ensure that:

Critical styles are loaded and applied.
Critical scripts are loaded and run.
The HTML visible for the user's initial view of the page has been parsed, so it renders consistently.

Styles are render blocked by default, and scripts can be render blocked using the blocking="render" attribute.
To ensure that your initial HTML has been parsed and will always render consistently before the transition animation runs, you can use <link rel="expect">. In this element, you include the following attributes:

rel="expect" to indicate that you want to use this <link> element to render block some HTML on the page.
href="#element-id" to indicate the ID of the element you want to render block.
blocking="render" to render block the specified HTML.

Let's explore what this looks like with an example HTML document:
html<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <!-- This will be render-blocking by default -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />

    <!-- Marking critical scripts as render blocking will
         ensure they're run before the view transition is activated -->
    <script async href="layout.js" blocking="render"></script>

    <!-- Use rel="expect" and blocking="render" to ensure the
         #lead-content element is visible and fully parsed before
         activating the transition -->
    <link rel="expect" href="#lead-content" blocking="render" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Page title</h1>
    <nav>...</nav>
    <div id="lead-content">
      <section id="first-section">The first section</section>
      <section>The second section</section>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>

The result is that document rendering is blocked until the lead content <div> has been parsed, ensuring a consistent view transition.
You can also specify a media attribute on <link rel="expect"> elements. For example, you might want to block rendering on a smaller amount of content when loading the page on a narrow-screen device, than on a wide-screen device. This makes sense — on a mobile, less content will be visible when the page first loads than in the case of a desktop.
This could be achieved with the following HTML:
html<link
  rel="expect"
  href="#lead-content"
  blocking="render"
  media="screen and (min-width: 641px)" />
<link
  rel="expect"
  href="#first-section"
  blocking="render"
  media="screen and (max-width: 640px)" />

The Temporal object enables date and time management in various scenarios, including built-in time zone and calendar representation, wall-clock time conversions, arithmetics, formatting, and more. It is designed as a full replacement for the Date object.DescriptionUnlike most global objects, Temporal is not a constructor. You cannot use it with the new operator or invoke the Temporal object as a function. All properties and methods of Temporal are static (just like the Math object).
Temporal has an intricate and powerful API. It exposes over 200 utility methods via several classes, so it could appear very complex. We will provide a high-level overview of how these APIs are related to each other.Background and conceptsJavaScript has had the Date object for handling date and time since its first days. However, the Date API is based on the poorly designed java.util.Date class from Java, which was replaced in the early 2010s; but, because of JavaScript's goal of backward compatibility, Date sticks around in the language.
The important lesson to preface the whole introduction is that date handling is complex. Most of the problems of Date are fixable by adding more methods, but a fundamental design flaw remains: it exposes so many methods on the same object that developers are often confused about what to use, leading to unexpected pitfalls. A well-designed API not only needs to do more, but also should do less with each level of abstraction, because preventing misuse is as important as enabling use cases.
Date objects wear two hats simultaneously:

As a timestamp: the number of milliseconds or nanoseconds elapsed since a fixed point in time (known as the epoch).
As a combination of components: year, month, day, hour, minute, second, millisecond, and nanosecond. The year, month, and day identifiers only make sense with reference to a calendar system. The whole combination maps to a unique instant in history when associated with a time zone. Date objects provide methods for reading and modifying these components.

Time zones underlie a significant number of date-related bugs. When interacting with a Date via the "combination of components" model, the time can only be in two time zones: UTC and local (device), and there's no way to specify an arbitrary time zone. Also lacking is the concept of "no time zone": this is known as a calendar date (for dates) or wall-clock time (for times), which is a time you "read off a calendar or clock". For example, if you are setting a daily wake up alarm, you will want to set it to "8:00AM" regardless of whether it is daylight saving time or not, whether you have traveled to a different time zone, etc.
A second feature lacking from Date is a calendar system. Most people may be familiar with the Gregorian calendar, where there are two eras, BC and AD; there are 12 months; each month has a different number of days; there's a leap year every 4 years; and so on. However, some of these concepts may not apply when you are working with another calendar system, such as the Hebrew calendar, the Chinese calendar, the Japanese calendar, etc. With Date, you can only work with the Gregorian calendar model.
There are many other undesirable legacies about Date, such as all setters being mutating (which often causes unwanted side effects), the date time string format being impossible to parse in a consistent way, etc. In the end, the best solution is to build a new API from scratch, which is what Temporal is.API overviewTemporal is a namespace, like Intl. It contains several classes and namespaces, each of which is designed to handle a specific aspect of date and time management. The classes can be grouped as such:

Representing a time duration (a difference between two time points): Temporal.Duration
Representing a time point:

Representing a unique instant in history:

As a timestamp: Temporal.Instant
As a date-time component combination paired with a time zone: Temporal.ZonedDateTime


Representing a time-zone-unaware date/time (which are all prefixed with "Plain"):

Date (year, month, day) + time (hour, minute, second, millisecond, microsecond, nanosecond): Temporal.PlainDateTime (Note: ZonedDateTime is equivalent to PlainDateTime plus a time zone)

Date (year, month, day): Temporal.PlainDate

Year, month: Temporal.PlainYearMonth
Month, day: Temporal.PlainMonthDay


Time (hour, minute, second, millisecond, microsecond, nanosecond): Temporal.PlainTime







Furthermore, there's also another utility namespace, Temporal.Now, which provides methods for getting the current time in various formats.Shared class interfaceThere are many classes in the Temporal namespace, but they share many similar methods.

With these tables, you should have a basic idea of how to navigate the Temporal API.CalendarsA calendar is a way to organize days, typically into periods of weeks, months, years, and eras. Most of the world uses the Gregorian calendar, but there are many other calendars in use, especially in religious and cultural contexts. By default, all calendar-aware Temporal objects use the ISO 8601 calendar system, which is based on the Gregorian calendar and defines additional week-numbering rules. Intl.supportedValuesOf() lists most of the calendars likely to be supported by browsers. Here we provide a brief overview of how calendar systems are formed to help you internalize what factors may vary between calendars.
There are three prominent periodic events on Earth: its rotation around the sun (365.242 days for one revolution), the moon's rotation around the Earth (29.53 days from new moon to new moon), and its rotation around its axis (24 hours from sunrise to sunrise). Every culture has the same measure of a "day", which is 24 hours. Occasional changes such as daylight saving time are not part of the calendar, but are part of the time zone's information.

Some calendars primarily define one year as 365.242 days on average, by defining years to have 365 days, and adding an extra day, the leap day, about every 4 years. Then, the year may be further divided into parts called months. These calendars are called solar calendars. The Gregorian calendar and the Solar Hijri calendar are solar calendars.
Some calendars primarily define one month as 29.5 days on average, by defining months to alternate between 29 and 30 days. Then, 12 months may be grouped into a year of 354 days. These calendars are called lunar calendars. The Islamic calendar is a lunar calendar. Because a lunar year is artificial and does not correlate with the season cycle, lunar calendars are generally rarer.
Some calendars also primarily define months based on lunar cycles, like lunar calendars. Then, to compensate for the 11-day discrepancy with the solar year, an extra month, the leap month, is added about every 3 years. These calendars are called lunisolar calendars. The Hebrew calendar and the Chinese calendar are lunisolar calendars.

In Temporal, every date under one calendar system is uniquely identified by three components: year, month, and day. While year is typically a positive integer, it may also be zero or negative, and increases monotonically with time. The year 1 (or 0, if it exists) is known as the calendar epoch, and is arbitrary for each calendar. month is a positive integer that increments by 1 every time, starting at 1 and ending at date.monthsInYear, then resetting back to 1 as the year advances. day is also a positive integer, but it may not start at 1 or increment by 1 every time, because political changes may cause days to be skipped or repeated. But in general, day monotonically increases and resets as the month advances.
In addition to year, a year can also be uniquely identified by the combination of era and eraYear, for calendars that use eras. For example, the Gregorian calendar uses the era "CE" (Common Era) and "BCE" (Before Common Era), and the year -1 is the same as { era: "bce", eraYear: 1 }. era is a lowercase string, and eraYear is an arbitrary integer that may be zero or negative, or even decrease with time (usually for the oldest era).

Note:
Always use era and eraYear as a pair; don't use one property without also using the other. In addition, to avoid conflicts, don't combine year and era/eraYear when designating a year. Pick one year representation and use it consistently.
Be careful of the following incorrect assumptions about years:

Don't assume that era and eraYear are always present; they may be undefined.
Don't assume that era is a user-friendly string; use toLocaleString() to format your date instead.
Don't assume that two year values from different calendars are comparable; use the compare() static method instead.
Don't assume that years have 365/366 days and 12 months; use daysInYear and monthsInYear instead.
Don't assume that leap years (inLeapYear is true) have one extra day; they may have an extra month.


In addition to month, a month in a year can also be uniquely identified by the monthCode. monthCode usually maps to the month's name, but month does not. For example, in the case of lunisolar calendars, two months with the same monthCode, where one belongs to a leap year and the other one does not, will have different month values if they come after the leap month, due to the insertion of an extra month.

Note:
To avoid conflicts, don't combine month and monthCode when designating a month. Pick one month representation and use it consistently. month is more useful if you need the order of months in a year (e.g., when looping through the months), while monthCode is more useful if you need the name of the month (e.g., when storing birthdays).
Be careful of the following incorrect assumptions about months:

Don't assume that monthCode and month always correspond.
Don't assume the number of days in a month; use daysInMonth instead.
Don't assume that monthCode is a user-friendly string; use toLocaleString() to format your date instead.
Generally, don't cache the name of months in an array or object. Even though monthCode usually maps to the month's name within one calendar, we recommend always computing the month's name using, for example, date.toLocaleString("en-US", { calendar: date.calendarId, month: "long" }).


In addition to day (which is a month-based index), a day in a year can also be uniquely identified by the dayOfYear. dayOfYear is a positive integer that increments by 1 every time, starting at 1 and ending at date.daysInYear.
The concept of a "week" is not connected with any astronomical event, but is a cultural construct. While the most common length is 7 days, weeks can also have 4, 5, 6, 8, or more days — or even lack a fixed number of days altogether. To get the specific number of days of the week of a date, use the date's daysInWeek. Temporal identifies weeks by the combination of weekOfYear and yearOfWeek. weekOfYear is a positive integer that increments by 1 every time, starting at 1, then resetting back to 1 as the year advances. yearOfWeek is generally the same as year, but may be different at the start or end of each year, because one week may cross two years, and yearOfWeek picks one of the two years based on the calendar's rules.

Note:
Always use weekOfYear and yearOfWeek as a pair; don't use weekOfYear and year.
Be careful of the following incorrect assumptions about weeks:

Don't assume that weekOfYear and yearOfWeek are always present; they may be undefined.
Don't assume that weeks are always 7 days long; use daysInWeek instead.
Note that the current Temporal API does not support year-week dates, so you can't construct dates using these properties or serialize dates to year-week representations. They are only informational properties.

RFC 9557 formatAll Temporal classes can be serialized and deserialized using the format specified in RFC 9557, which is based on ISO 8601 / RFC 3339. The format, in its full form, is as follows (spaces are only for readability and should not be present in the actual string):
YYYY-MM-DD T HH:mm:ss.sssssssss Z/±HH:mm [time_zone_id] [u-ca=calendar_id]

Different classes have different requirements for the presence of each component, so you will find a section titled "RFC 9557 format" in each class's documentation, which specifies the format recognized by that class.
This is very similar to the date time string format used by Date, which is also based on ISO 8601. The main addition is the ability to specify micro- and nanosecond components, and the ability to specify the time zone and calendar system.Representable datesAll Temporal objects that represent a specific calendar date impose a similar limit on the range of representable dates, which is ±108 days (inclusive) from the Unix epoch, or the range of instants from -271821-04-20T00:00:00 to +275760-09-13T00:00:00. This is the same range as valid dates. More specifically:

Temporal.Instant and Temporal.ZonedDateTime apply this limit directly on its epochNanoseconds value.
Temporal.PlainDateTime interprets the date-time in the UTC time zone and requires it to be ±(108 + 1) days (exclusive) from the Unix epoch, so its valid range is -271821-04-19T00:00:00 to +275760-09-14T00:00:00, exclusive. This allows any ZonedDateTime to be converted to a PlainDateTime regardless of its offset.
Temporal.PlainDate applies the same check as PlainDateTime to the noon (12:00:00) of that date, so its valid range is -271821-04-19 to +275760-09-13. This allows any PlainDateTime to be converted to a PlainDate regardless of its time, and vice versa.
Temporal.PlainYearMonth has the valid range of -271821-04 to +275760-09. This allows any PlainDate to be converted to a PlainYearMonth regardless of its date (except if a non-ISO month's first day falls in the ISO month -271821-03).

The Temporal objects will refuse to construct an instance representing a date/time beyond this limit. This includes:

Using the constructor or from() static method.
Using the with() method to update calendar fields.
Using add(), subtract(), round(), or any other method to derive new instances.
Static properties
Temporal.Duration 
Experimental


Represents a difference between two time points, which can be used in date/time arithmetic. It is fundamentally represented as a combination of years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds, microseconds, and nanoseconds values.

Temporal.Instant 
Experimental


Represents a unique point in time, with nanosecond precision. It is fundamentally represented as the number of nanoseconds since the Unix epoch (midnight at the beginning of January 1, 1970, UTC), without any time zone or calendar system.

Temporal.Now 
Experimental


Provides methods for getting the current time in various formats.

Temporal.PlainDate 
Experimental


Represents a calendar date (a date without a time or time zone); for example, an event on a calendar which happens during the whole day no matter which time zone it's happening in. It is fundamentally represented as an ISO 8601 calendar date, with year, month, and day fields, and an associated calendar system.

Temporal.PlainDateTime 
Experimental


Represents a date (calendar date) and time (wall-clock time) without a time zone. It is fundamentally represented as a combination of a date (with an associated calendar system) and a time.

Temporal.PlainMonthDay 
Experimental


Represents the month and day of a calendar date, without a year or time zone; for example, an event on a calendar that recurs every year and happens during the whole day. It is fundamentally represented as an ISO 8601 calendar date, with year, month, and day fields, and an associated calendar system. The year is used to disambiguate the month-day in non-ISO calendar systems.

Temporal.PlainTime 
Experimental


Represents a time without a date or time zone; for example, a recurring event that happens at the same time every day. It is fundamentally represented as a combination of hour, minute, second, millisecond, microsecond, and nanosecond values.

Temporal.PlainYearMonth 
Experimental


Represents the year and month of a calendar date, without a day or time zone; for example, an event on a calendar that happens during the whole month. It is fundamentally represented as an ISO 8601 calendar date, with year, month, and day fields, and an associated calendar system. The day is used to disambiguate the year-month in non-ISO calendar systems.

Temporal.ZonedDateTime 
Experimental


Represents a date and time with a time zone. It is fundamentally represented as a combination of an instant, a time zone, and a calendar system.

Temporal[Symbol.toStringTag]

The initial value of the [Symbol.toStringTag] property is the string "Temporal". This property is used in Object.prototype.toString().

The Temporal object enables date and time management in various scenarios, including built-in time zone and calendar representation, wall-clock time conversions, arithmetics, formatting, and more. It is designed as a full replacement for the Date object.DescriptionUnlike most global objects, Temporal is not a constructor. You cannot use it with the new operator or invoke the Temporal object as a function. All properties and methods of Temporal are static (just like the Math object).
Temporal has an intricate and powerful API. It exposes over 200 utility methods via several classes, so it could appear very complex. We will provide a high-level overview of how these APIs are related to each other.Background and conceptsJavaScript has had the Date object for handling date and time since its first days. However, the Date API is based on the poorly designed java.util.Date class from Java, which was replaced in the early 2010s; but, because of JavaScript's goal of backward compatibility, Date sticks around in the language.
The important lesson to preface the whole introduction is that date handling is complex. Most of the problems of Date are fixable by adding more methods, but a fundamental design flaw remains: it exposes so many methods on the same object that developers are often confused about what to use, leading to unexpected pitfalls. A well-designed API not only needs to do more, but also should do less with each level of abstraction, because preventing misuse is as important as enabling use cases.
Date objects wear two hats simultaneously:

As a timestamp: the number of milliseconds or nanoseconds elapsed since a fixed point in time (known as the epoch).
As a combination of components: year, month, day, hour, minute, second, millisecond, and nanosecond. The year, month, and day identifiers only make sense with reference to a calendar system. The whole combination maps to a unique instant in history when associated with a time zone. Date objects provide methods for reading and modifying these components.

Time zones underlie a significant number of date-related bugs. When interacting with a Date via the "combination of components" model, the time can only be in two time zones: UTC and local (device), and there's no way to specify an arbitrary time zone. Also lacking is the concept of "no time zone": this is known as a calendar date (for dates) or wall-clock time (for times), which is a time you "read off a calendar or clock". For example, if you are setting a daily wake up alarm, you will want to set it to "8:00AM" regardless of whether it is daylight saving time or not, whether you have traveled to a different time zone, etc.
A second feature lacking from Date is a calendar system. Most people may be familiar with the Gregorian calendar, where there are two eras, BC and AD; there are 12 months; each month has a different number of days; there's a leap year every 4 years; and so on. However, some of these concepts may not apply when you are working with another calendar system, such as the Hebrew calendar, the Chinese calendar, the Japanese calendar, etc. With Date, you can only work with the Gregorian calendar model.
There are many other undesirable legacies about Date, such as all setters being mutating (which often causes unwanted side effects), the date time string format being impossible to parse in a consistent way, etc. In the end, the best solution is to build a new API from scratch, which is what Temporal is.API overviewTemporal is a namespace, like Intl.

The concept of a "week" is not connected with any astronomical event, but is a cultural construct. While the most common length is 7 days, weeks can also have 4, 5, 6, 8, or more days — or even lack a fixed number of days altogether. To get the specific number of days of the week of a date, use the date's daysInWeek. Temporal identifies weeks by the combination of weekOfYear and yearOfWeek. weekOfYear is a positive integer that increments by 1 every time, starting at 1, then resetting back to 1 as the year advances. yearOfWeek is generally the same as year, but may be different at the start or end of each year, because one week may cross two years, and yearOfWeek picks one of the two years based on the calendar's rules.

Note:
Always use weekOfYear and yearOfWeek as a pair; don't use weekOfYear and year.
Be careful of the following incorrect assumptions about weeks:

Don't assume that weekOfYear and yearOfWeek are always present; they may be undefined.
Don't assume that weeks are always 7 days long; use daysInWeek instead.
Note that the current Temporal API does not support year-week dates, so you can't construct dates using these properties or serialize dates to year-week representations. They are only informational properties.

RFC 9557 formatAll Temporal classes can be serialized and deserialized using the format specified in RFC 9557, which is based on ISO 8601 / RFC 3339. The format, in its full form, is as follows (spaces are only for readability and should not be present in the actual string):
YYYY-MM-DD T HH:mm:ss.sssssssss Z/±HH:mm [time_zone_id] [u-ca=calendar_id]

Different classes have different requirements for the presence of each component, so you will find a section titled "RFC 9557 format" in each class's documentation, which specifies the format recognized by that class.
This is very similar to the date time string format used by Date, which is also based on ISO 8601. The main addition is the ability to specify micro- and nanosecond components, and the ability to specify the time zone and calendar system.Representable datesAll Temporal objects that represent a specific calendar date impose a similar limit on the range of representable dates, which is ±108 days (inclusive) from the Unix epoch, or the range of instants from -271821-04-20T00:00:00 to +275760-09-13T00:00:00. This is the same range as valid dates. More specifically:

Temporal.Instant and Temporal.ZonedDateTime apply this limit directly on its epochNanoseconds value.
Temporal.PlainDateTime interprets the date-time in the UTC time zone and requires it to be ±(108 + 1) days (exclusive) from the Unix epoch, so its valid range is -271821-04-19T00:00:00 to +275760-09-14T00:00:00, exclusive. This allows any ZonedDateTime to be converted to a PlainDateTime regardless of its offset.
Temporal.PlainDate applies the same check as PlainDateTime to the noon (12:00:00) of that date, so its valid range is -271821-04-19 to +275760-09-13. This allows any PlainDateTime to be converted to a PlainDate regardless of its time, and vice versa.
Temporal.PlainYearMonth has the valid range of -271821-04 to +275760-09. This allows any PlainDate to be converted to a PlainYearMonth regardless of its date (except if a non-ISO month's first day falls in the ISO month -271821-03).

The Temporal objects will refuse to construct an instance representing a date/time beyond this limit. This includes:

Using the constructor or from() static method.
Using the with() method to update calendar fields.
Using add(), subtract(), round(), or any other method to derive new instances.

The Temporal object enables date and time management in various scenarios, including built-in time zone and calendar representation, wall-clock time conversions, arithmetics, formatting, and more. It is designed as a full replacement for the Date object.DescriptionUnlike most global objects, Temporal is not a constructor. You cannot use it with the new operator or invoke the Temporal object as a function. All properties and methods of Temporal are static (just like the Math object).
Temporal has an intricate and powerful API. It exposes over 200 utility methods via several classes, so it could appear very complex. We will provide a high-level overview of how these APIs are related to each other.Background and conceptsJavaScript has had the Date object for handling date and time since its first days. However, the Date API is based on the poorly designed java.util.Date class from Java, which was replaced in the early 2010s; but, because of JavaScript's goal of backward compatibility, Date sticks around in the language.
The important lesson to preface the whole introduction is that date handling is complex. Most of the problems of Date are fixable by adding more methods, but a fundamental design flaw remains: it exposes so many methods on the same object that developers are often confused about what to use, leading to unexpected pitfalls. A well-designed API not only needs to do more, but also should do less with each level of abstraction, because preventing misuse is as important as enabling use cases.
Date objects wear two hats simultaneously:

As a timestamp: the number of milliseconds or nanoseconds elapsed since a fixed point in time (known as the epoch).
As a combination of components: year, month, day, hour, minute, second, millisecond, and nanosecond. The year, month, and day identifiers only make sense with reference to a calendar system. The whole combination maps to a unique instant in history when associated with a time zone. Date objects provide methods for reading and modifying these components.

Time zones underlie a significant number of date-related bugs. When interacting with a Date via the "combination of components" model, the time can only be in two time zones: UTC and local (device), and there's no way to specify an arbitrary time zone. Also lacking is the concept of "no time zone": this is known as a calendar date (for dates) or wall-clock time (for times), which is a time you "read off a calendar or clock". For example, if you are setting a daily wake up alarm, you will want to set it to "8:00AM" regardless of whether it is daylight saving time or not, whether you have traveled to a different time zone, etc.
A second feature lacking from Date is a calendar system. Most people may be familiar with the Gregorian calendar, where there are two eras, BC and AD; there are 12 months; each month has a different number of days; there's a leap year every 4 years; and so on. However, some of these concepts may not apply when you are working with another calendar system, such as the Hebrew calendar, the Chinese calendar, the Japanese calendar, etc. With Date, you can only work with the Gregorian calendar model.
There are many other undesirable legacies about Date, such as all setters being mutating (which often causes unwanted side effects), the date time string format being impossible to parse in a consistent way, etc. In the end, the best solution is to build a new API from scratch, which is what Temporal is.API overviewTemporal is a namespace, like Intl. It contains several classes and namespaces, each of which is designed to handle a specific aspect of date and time management. The classes can be grouped as such:

Representing a time duration (a difference between two time points): Temporal.Duration
Representing a time point:

Representing a unique instant in history:

As a timestamp: Temporal.Instant
As a date-time component combination paired with a time zone: Temporal.ZonedDateTime


Representing a time-zone-unaware date/time (which are all prefixed with "Plain"):

Date (year, month, day) + time (hour, minute, second, millisecond, microsecond, nanosecond): Temporal.PlainDateTime (Note: ZonedDateTime is equivalent to PlainDateTime plus a time zone)

Date (year, month, day): Temporal.PlainDate

Year, month: Temporal.PlainYearMonth
Month, day: Temporal.PlainMonthDay


Time (hour, minute, second, millisecond, microsecond, nanosecond): Temporal.PlainTime







Furthermore, there's also another utility namespace, Temporal.Now, which provides methods for getting the current time in various formats.Shared class interfaceThere are many classes in the Temporal namespace, but they share many similar methods.

With these tables, you should have a basic idea of how to navigate the Temporal API.CalendarsA calendar is a way to organize days, typically into periods of weeks, months, years, and eras. Most of the world uses the Gregorian calendar, but there are many other calendars in use, especially in religious and cultural contexts. By default, all calendar-aware Temporal objects use the ISO 8601 calendar system, which is based on the Gregorian calendar and defines additional week-numbering rules. Intl.supportedValuesOf() lists most of the calendars likely to be supported by browsers. Here we provide a brief overview of how calendar systems are formed to help you internalize what factors may vary between calendars.
There are three prominent periodic events on Earth: its rotation around the sun (365.242 days for one revolution), the moon's rotation around the Earth (29.53 days from new moon to new moon), and its rotation around its axis (24 hours from sunrise to sunrise). Every culture has the same measure of a "day", which is 24 hours. Occasional changes such as daylight saving time are not part of the calendar, but are part of the time zone's information.

Some calendars primarily define one year as 365.242 days on average, by defining years to have 365 days, and adding an extra day, the leap day, about every 4 years. Then, the year may be further divided into parts called months. These calendars are called solar calendars. The Gregorian calendar and the Solar Hijri calendar are solar calendars.
Some calendars primarily define one month as 29.5 days on average, by defining months to alternate between 29 and 30 days. Then, 12 months may be grouped into a year of 354 days. These calendars are called lunar calendars. The Islamic calendar is a lunar calendar. Because a lunar year is artificial and does not correlate with the season cycle, lunar calendars are generally rarer.
Some calendars also primarily define months based on lunar cycles, like lunar calendars. Then, to compensate for the 11-day discrepancy with the solar year, an extra month, the leap month, is added about every 3 years. These calendars are called lunisolar calendars. The Hebrew calendar and the Chinese calendar are lunisolar calendars.

In Temporal, every date under one calendar system is uniquely identified by three components: year, month, and day. While year is typically a positive integer, it may also be zero or negative, and increases monotonically with time. The year 1 (or 0, if it exists) is known as the calendar epoch, and is arbitrary for each calendar. month is a positive integer that increments by 1 every time, starting at 1 and ending at date.monthsInYear, then resetting back to 1 as the year advances. day is also a positive integer, but it may not start at 1 or increment by 1 every time, because political changes may cause days to be skipped or repeated. But in general, day monotonically increases and resets as the month advances.
In addition to year, a year can also be uniquely identified by the combination of era and eraYear, for calendars that use eras. For example, the Gregorian calendar uses the era "CE" (Common Era) and "BCE" (Before Common Era), and the year -1 is the same as { era: "bce", eraYear: 1 }. era is a lowercase string, and eraYear is an arbitrary integer that may be zero or negative, or even decrease with time (usually for the oldest era).

Note:
Always use era and eraYear as a pair; don't use one property without also using the other. In addition, to avoid conflicts, don't combine year and era/eraYear when designating a year. Pick one year representation and use it consistently.
Be careful of the following incorrect assumptions about years:

Don't assume that era and eraYear are always present; they may be undefined.
Don't assume that era is a user-friendly string; use toLocaleString() to format your date instead.
Don't assume that two year values from different calendars are comparable; use the compare() static method instead.
Don't assume that years have 365/366 days and 12 months; use daysInYear and monthsInYear instead.
Don't assume that leap years (inLeapYear is true) have one extra day; they may have an extra month.


In addition to month, a month in a year can also be uniquely identified by the monthCode. monthCode usually maps to the month's name, but month does not. For example, in the case of lunisolar calendars, two months with the same monthCode, where one belongs to a leap year and the other one does not, will have different month values if they come after the leap month, due to the insertion of an extra month.

Note:
To avoid conflicts, don't combine month and monthCode when designating a month. Pick one month representation and use it consistently. month is more useful if you need the order of months in a year (e.g., when looping through the months), while monthCode is more useful if you need the name of the month (e.g., when storing birthdays).
Be careful of the following incorrect assumptions about months:

Don't assume that monthCode and month always correspond.
Don't assume the number of days in a month; use daysInMonth instead.
Don't assume that monthCode is a user-friendly string; use toLocaleString() to format your date instead.
Generally, don't cache the name of months in an array or object. Even though monthCode usually maps to the month's name within one calendar, we recommend always computing the month's name using, for example, date.toLocaleString("en-US", { calendar: date.calendarId, month: "long" }).


In addition to day (which is a month-based index), a day in a year can also be uniquely identified by the dayOfYear. dayOfYear is a positive integer that increments by 1 every time, starting at 1 and ending at date.daysInYear.
The concept of a "week" is not connected with any astronomical event, but is a cultural construct. While the most common length is 7 days, weeks can also have 4, 5, 6, 8, or more days — or even lack a fixed number of days altogether. To get the specific number of days of the week of a date, use the date's daysInWeek. Temporal identifies weeks by the combination of weekOfYear and yearOfWeek. weekOfYear is a positive integer that increments by 1 every time, starting at 1, then resetting back to 1 as the year advances. yearOfWeek is generally the same as year, but may be different at the start or end of each year, because one week may cross two years, and yearOfWeek picks one of the two years based on the calendar's rules.

Note:
Always use weekOfYear and yearOfWeek as a pair; don't use weekOfYear and year.
Be careful of the following incorrect assumptions about weeks:

Don't assume that weekOfYear and yearOfWeek are always present; they may be undefined.
Don't assume that weeks are always 7 days long; use daysInWeek instead.
Note that the current Temporal API does not support year-week dates, so you can't construct dates using these properties or serialize dates to year-week representations. They are only informational properties.

RFC 9557 formatAll Temporal classes can be serialized and deserialized using the format specified in RFC 9557, which is based on ISO 8601 / RFC 3339. The format, in its full form, is as follows (spaces are only for readability and should not be present in the actual string):

Our commitment includes maintenance of long-existing content and documenting features that are brand new to the web platform.
In 2024, the MDN content team chose some content areas to audit and update so they stay useful and relevant in an evolving web platform.
We looked at topics that were popular but contained some outdated or incomplete material, and invested time in improvements, additions, and removing obsolete content.
This post recaps what we achieved in our content projects in 2024, highlights some of our top picks and recommended reading, and looks forward to what's next on MDN for 2025.2024 MDN content areasFor 2024, we chose three technology categories that are popular, but had reader feedback that indicated they needed a refresh.
We focused on HTTP, MathML, and web Manifests.
From July to December 2024, the team worked through these areas to bring the quality up in a number of ways.
Let's have a look at what changed in each section below.MathMLMathML is an XML-based language for describing mathematical notation on the web. Similar to SVG, MathML can also be included in the HTML and rendered by the browser, no plugins or libraries are required.

</math>

Unlike the MathML Core specification, which often groups elements, MDN now features each MathML element on its page, with examples, usage notes, and BCD (browser-compat-data) now also updated. For example, you can read about <semantics>, <annotation> and <annotation-xml> elements and how they help to annotate MathML expressions.
Just like we're writing this blog post using Markdown instead of HTML, MathML is often generated by math processors using lightweight markup languages like LaTeX. To help content authors, all MathML examples now have annotations. For example, x2+yx^{2} + y can be written as x^{2} + y in LaTeX:
html<math>
  <semantics>
    <mrow>
      <msup>
        <mi>x</mi>
        <mn>2</mn>
      </msup>
      <mo>+</mo>
      <mi>y</mi>
    </mrow>
    <!-- Annotated with LaTeX, a lightweight markup language. -->
    <annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x^{2} + y</annotation>
  </semantics>
</math>

This will also allow us to start using LaTeX for MathML in the future, making it easier for content authors to write and maintain examples. To fully appreciate the difference, you can compare the full MathML source code of some bigger examples, such as Deriving the Quadratic Formula and Proving the Pythagorean theorem, with their LaTeX equivalents.
MathML documentation on MDN now features accessibility information for all elements. For example, using <math> element for representing math content allows screen readers to read the formula, which makes MathML better for such cases than using images or other formats.
Additionally, all MathML features now have live examples, so you can see how they're rendered in your browser. And just like with other live examples on MDN, you can always click "Play" in the top right corner to play around with the code in a new tab.

Not only is MathML documented on MDN, but it's also used to describe different parts of the web platform. For example, Set.difference() JavaScript method, CSS transformation functions, 3D collision detection in game development, WebXR Device API, and many more.
We made sure MathML is now rendered correctly throughout MDN: inside paragraphs and on the block level, on big and small screens, and in different browsers.Manifest (web app manifests)A web app manifest is a JSON text file that provides information about a web application.
The most common use for a manifest is to provide information that the browser needs to install a progressive web app (PWA) on a device, such as the app's name and icon.
json{
  "name": "HackerWeb",
  "short_name": "HackerWeb",
  "start_url": "/index.html",
  "display": "standalone",
  "background_color": "#ffffff",
  "description": "A readable Hacker News app",
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "images/icons/homescreen192.png",
      "sizes": "192x192",
      "type": "image/png"
    }
  ]
}

For the manifest content updates, Dipika collaborated with Firefox engineer Jonathan Almeida to update browser compatibility data for manifest members in Firefox.
The manifest BCD additions now cover compat data for Firefox and Firefox for Android, ensuring accurate and up-to-date support information.
Readers on MDN, Can I use, and other sites, now have solid guidance on manifest support across browsers.
On the content side, several improvements landed across the section for prose, layout and templating fixes.
The page template is now improved for readability and consistency across the entire section.
For each member value (for example, "display": "standalone",), there is a proper prose description, with example scenarios where the value might be used.
Usage notes are collected into a dedicated "Description" section, and any caveats that the specification mentioned that were not in the MDN pages and now documented.
Some pages were missing "Syntax" sections completely, so now these gaps are filled so readers can better understand how to use the documented features and some possible member values:
json/* Boolean values */
"prefer_related_applications": true
"prefer_related_applications": false

This refresh made sure that the existing content was more comprehensive and readable but also included references to similar features, which allowed for more flexibility for developers. For example, using prefers-color-scheme in HTML to set different theme_color values for light and dark mode:
html<meta
  name="theme-color"
  content="#F4E6D8"
  media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" />
<meta
  name="theme-color"
  content="#5D4037"
  media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" />
HTTP content updatesHTTP is a protocol that's foundational for data exchange on the web.
It allows communication between browsers and servers, but it can also be used for machine-to-machine communication, automating access to APIs, and more.
On MDN, the HTTP section has over 300 pages of reference material, and the majority of pages are about HTTP headers and response status codes.
Response status codes let the client know the outcome of a HTTP request (such as 200, 404), and give some additional context in certain cases.
There are 61 status codes documented on MDN and they include examples for common responses and clarifications for rarer types that web developers may not encounter often.
You can even make sure you're familiar with the 418 (I'm a teapot) status just in case.
There are 148 HTTP headers documented on MDN.
HTTP headers are the parts of the HTTP message that carry metadata, information about the client or server, instructions for the recipient, and so on.
Some headers have several sub-pages that describe mechanisms you can control via headers, such as Content Security Policy (CSP) directives that instruct a browser to restrict what the code comprising a site can run and Permissions Policy directives for requesting permission to use browser features such as location or microphone access.
The HTTP guides have overviews of how the protocol works, describing the evolution of the protocol from HTTP/0.9 right through to current versions.
We document different ways to control HTTP interactions such as caching and conditional requests, and we have guides about how to use and understand the protocol for beginners, right up to more involved topics.
A lot of the refresh of these guides meant making less specific references to HTTP/1.1 when talking about message formats seeing as HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 are increasingly common.
httpHEAD /en-US/docs/Web/HTTP HTTP/2
Host: developer.mozilla.org
User-Agent: curl/8.7.1
Accept: */*

* Request completely sent off
HTTP/2 200

To summarize, the changes we made across the entire HTTP section included adding examples where they were missing or too short to be useful, removing outdated or obsolete information, and making the formatting and presentation consistent over all pages.
HTTP highlights on MDN
Part of the refresh involved updating and adding sequence diagrams that explain client-server exchanges.
We've been finding mermaid syntax useful for a lot of these types of diagrams as it makes it easier to store sources for images that we may need to update later.
These images are stored in the shared-assets repository, which allows us to reuse images instead of duplicate them in the source, and these are easier to write, read, maintain, and they look nice, too:

One interesting pick from the HTTP section is the Server-Timing response header that you can use to surface server metrics to a client:
httpHTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 123
Date: Fri, 03 Jan 2025 10:41:21 GMT
Server-Timing: custom-metric;dur=123.45;desc="My custom metric"

--- response body ---

Depending on the type of request, you can decide if you want to send server timings to the client, and these are visible in the Network request details panel in most browser's developer tools.
For example, the BBC iPlayer is using the Server-Timing header to send performance metrics about the service, visible in the Network > Timings panel below.
If you find this interesting, be sure to check the Performance API and the Web performance documentation.

For the HTTP section, most of the BCD updates involved improving the accuracy of existing entries and adding missing compat data for headers.
Additions included the Service-Worker request header for logging service worker script requests and the Sec-Websocket-* headers used in the WebSocket handshake.
Most of the HTTP updates are for older features, but the accuracy of the support information is crucial for developers making decisions about what to build.
One example is the Trailer compatibility details which now reflects browser implementations.
It's important to avoid misleading information in compatibility tables because they may encourage people to develop functionality in their applications for features that have poor browser support in reality.Other 2024 content highlights on MDNHere's a few interesting picks of documentation that landed in 2024:

New! CSS anchor positioning documentation
New! Using the View Transition API guide

Aside from reference docs, we've written about these topics on the MDN blog:

Locale-sensitive text segmentation in JavaScript with Intl.Segmenter
Exclusive accordions using the HTML <details> element
New JavaScript Set methods
Using the Page Visibility API
Interop 2023: MDN updates
Creating effective technical documentation

We also blogged about these changes and launches:

A new learning experience on MDN merging the MDN Curriculum into Learn Web Development.
Introducing the MDN HTTP Observatory for testing server HTTP header configuration.
And, of course, we have a new Community page which we are delighted to share!
Firefox release notes for developersFirefox release notes describe what's changed for everyday browser users.
The MDN team document each Firefox release with release notes specifically for developers.
That means in 2024, Firefox versions 122 up to 133 have pages describing the changes in each Firefox release that developers can target.
You can find everything in the Firefox release notes for developers pages.
Something you may not be aware of is that we also document Experimental features in Firefox.
This page describes features implemented in Firefox that are only available behind a preference (though configuration).
You can test out upcoming features before they are released, which is ideal if you're planning to use an experimental technology or if you're curious and would like to provide feedback on Bugzilla.Kicking off 2025The content projects that the team worked on were a superb learning experience, and we hope our readers benefit greatly from it.
If you want to make our docs better, let us know if there are other sections that need attention, and even lend your expertise.
If you want to learn about a topic, why not try to improve the documentation!
By contributing to MDN, you can improve your skills in a technology category, and millions of readers will benefit from it.
We're happy to share that we saw the following contributions in mdn/content GitHub repository in 2024:

915 different authors contributed.
~4300 pull requests opened.
~1500 issues opened.

We want to send out a big thanks to everyone who contributed in 2024 and we hope to see you continue in 2025.
One of the first larger changes we're excited to see is that JavaScript Temporal is coming with support scheduled to land in Firefox 135.
There is a huge pull request for Temporal authored by Josh-Cena, which means you can expect to be able to read Temporal documentation on MDN very soon.
We hope you enjoyed this post!

Our commitment includes maintenance of long-existing content and documenting features that are brand new to the web platform.
In 2024, the MDN content team chose some content areas to audit and update so they stay useful and relevant in an evolving web platform.
We looked at topics that were popular but contained some outdated or incomplete material, and invested time in improvements, additions, and removing obsolete content.
This post recaps what we achieved in our content projects in 2024, highlights some of our top picks and recommended reading, and looks forward to what's next on MDN for 2025.2024 MDN content areasFor 2024, we chose three technology categories that are popular, but had reader feedback that indicated they needed a refresh.
We focused on HTTP, MathML, and web Manifests.
From July to December 2024, the team worked through these areas to bring the quality up in a number of ways.
Let's have a look at what changed in each section below.MathMLMathML is an XML-based language for describing mathematical notation on the web. Similar to SVG, MathML can also be included in the HTML and rendered by the browser, no plugins or libraries are required.

  
    ∑
    
      n
      =

    </mrow>
    <mrow>
      <mo>+</mo>
      <mn>∞</mn>
    </mrow>
  </munderover>
</math>

Unlike the MathML Core specification, which often groups elements, MDN now features each MathML element on its page, with examples, usage notes, and BCD (browser-compat-data) now also updated. For example, you can read about <semantics>, <annotation> and <annotation-xml> elements and how they help to annotate MathML expressions.
Just like we're writing this blog post using Markdown instead of HTML, MathML is often generated by math processors using lightweight markup languages like LaTeX. To help content authors, all MathML examples now have annotations. For example, x2+yx^{2} + y can be written as x^{2} + y in LaTeX:
html<math>
  <semantics>
    <mrow>
      <msup>
        <mi>x</mi>
        <mn>2</mn>
      </msup>
      <mo>+</mo>
      <mi>y</mi>
    </mrow>
    <!-- Annotated with LaTeX, a lightweight markup language. -->
    <annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x^{2} + y</annotation>
  </semantics>
</math>

This will also allow us to start using LaTeX for MathML in the future, making it easier for content authors to write and maintain examples. To fully appreciate the difference, you can compare the full MathML source code of some bigger examples, such as Deriving the Quadratic Formula and Proving the Pythagorean theorem, with their LaTeX equivalents.
MathML documentation on MDN now features accessibility information for all elements. For example, using <math> element for representing math content allows screen readers to read the formula, which makes MathML better for such cases than using images or other formats.
Additionally, all MathML features now have live examples, so you can see how they're rendered in your browser. And just like with other live examples on MDN, you can always click "Play" in the top right corner to play around with the code in a new tab.

Not only is MathML documented on MDN, but it's also used to describe different parts of the web platform. For example, Set.difference() JavaScript method, CSS transformation functions, 3D collision detection in game development, WebXR Device API, and many more.
We made sure MathML is now rendered correctly throughout MDN: inside paragraphs and on the block level, on big and small screens, and in different browsers.Manifest (web app manifests)A web app manifest is a JSON text file that provides information about a web application.
The most common use for a manifest is to provide information that the browser needs to install a progressive web app (PWA) on a device, such as the app's name and icon.
json{
  "name": "HackerWeb",
  "short_name": "HackerWeb",
  "start_url": "/index.html",
  "display": "standalone",
  "background_color": "#ffffff",
  "description": "A readable Hacker News app",
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "images/icons/homescreen192.png",
      "sizes": "192x192",
      "type": "image/png"
    }
  ]
}

For the manifest content updates, Dipika collaborated with Firefox engineer Jonathan Almeida to update browser compatibility data for manifest members in Firefox.
The manifest BCD additions now cover compat data for Firefox and Firefox for Android, ensuring accurate and up-to-date support information.
Readers on MDN, Can I use, and other sites, now have solid guidance on manifest support across browsers.
On the content side, several improvements landed across the section for prose, layout and templating fixes.
The page template is now improved for readability and consistency across the entire section.
For each member value (for example, "display": "standalone",), there is a proper prose description, with example scenarios where the value might be used.
Usage notes are collected into a dedicated "Description" section, and any caveats that the specification mentioned that were not in the MDN pages and now documented.
Some pages were missing "Syntax" sections completely, so now these gaps are filled so readers can better understand how to use the documented features and some possible member values:
json/* Boolean values */
"prefer_related_applications": true
"prefer_related_applications": false

This refresh made sure that the existing content was more comprehensive and readable but also included references to similar features, which allowed for more flexibility for developers. For example, using prefers-color-scheme in HTML to set different theme_color values for light and dark mode:
html<meta
  name="theme-color"
  content="#F4E6D8"
  media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" />
<meta
  name="theme-color"
  content="#5D4037"
  media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" />
HTTP content updatesHTTP is a protocol that's foundational for data exchange on the web.
It allows communication between browsers and servers, but it can also be used for machine-to-machine communication, automating access to APIs, and more.
On MDN, the HTTP section has over 300 pages of reference material, and the majority of pages are about HTTP headers and response status codes.
Response status codes let the client know the outcome of a HTTP request (such as 200, 404), and give some additional context in certain cases.
There are 61 status codes documented on MDN and they include examples for common responses and clarifications for rarer types that web developers may not encounter often.
You can even make sure you're familiar with the 418 (I'm a teapot) status just in case.
There are 148 HTTP headers documented on MDN.
HTTP headers are the parts of the HTTP message that carry metadata, information about the client or server, instructions for the recipient, and so on.
Some headers have several sub-pages that describe mechanisms you can control via headers, such as Content Security Policy (CSP) directives that instruct a browser to restrict what the code comprising a site can run and Permissions Policy directives for requesting permission to use browser features such as location or microphone access.
The HTTP guides have overviews of how the protocol works, describing the evolution of the protocol from HTTP/0.9 right through to current versions.
We document different ways to control HTTP interactions such as caching and conditional requests, and we have guides about how to use and understand the protocol for beginners, right up to more involved topics.
A lot of the refresh of these guides meant making less specific references to HTTP/1.1 when talking about message formats seeing as HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 are increasingly common.
httpHEAD /en-US/docs/Web/HTTP HTTP/2
Host: developer.mozilla.org
User-Agent: curl/8.7.1
Accept: */*

* Request completely sent off
HTTP/2 200

To summarize, the changes we made across the entire HTTP section included adding examples where they were missing or too short to be useful, removing outdated or obsolete information, and making the formatting and presentation consistent over all pages.
HTTP highlights on MDN
Part of the refresh involved updating and adding sequence diagrams that explain client-server exchanges.
We've been finding mermaid syntax useful for a lot of these types of diagrams as it makes it easier to store sources for images that we may need to update later.
These images are stored in the shared-assets repository, which allows us to reuse images instead of duplicate them in the source, and these are easier to write, read, maintain, and they look nice, too:

One interesting pick from the HTTP section is the Server-Timing response header that you can use to surface server metrics to a client:
httpHTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 123
Date: Fri, 03 Jan 2025 10:41:21 GMT
Server-Timing: custom-metric;dur=123.45;desc="My custom metric"

--- response body ---

Depending on the type of request, you can decide if you want to send server timings to the client, and these are visible in the Network request details panel in most browser's developer tools.
For example, the BBC iPlayer is using the Server-Timing header to send performance metrics about the service, visible in the Network > Timings panel below.
If you find this interesting, be sure to check the Performance API and the Web performance documentation.

For the HTTP section, most of the BCD updates involved improving the accuracy of existing entries and adding missing compat data for headers.
Additions included the Service-Worker request header for logging service worker script requests and the Sec-Websocket-* headers used in the WebSocket handshake.
Most of the HTTP updates are for older features, but the accuracy of the support information is crucial for developers making decisions about what to build.
One example is the Trailer compatibility details which now reflects browser implementations.
It's important to avoid misleading information in compatibility tables because they may encourage people to develop functionality in their applications for features that have poor browser support in reality.Other 2024 content highlights on MDNHere's a few interesting picks of documentation that landed in 2024:

New! CSS anchor positioning documentation
New! Using the View Transition API guide

Aside from reference docs, we've written about these topics on the MDN blog:

Locale-sensitive text segmentation in JavaScript with Intl.Segmenter
Exclusive accordions using the HTML <details> element
New JavaScript Set methods
Using the Page Visibility API
Interop 2023: MDN updates
Creating effective technical documentation

We also blogged about these changes and launches:

A new learning experience on MDN merging the MDN Curriculum into Learn Web Development.
Introducing the MDN HTTP Observatory for testing server HTTP header configuration.
And, of course, we have a new Community page which we are delighted to share!
Firefox release notes for developersFirefox release notes describe what's changed for everyday browser users.
The MDN team document each Firefox release with release notes specifically for developers.
That means in 2024, Firefox versions 122 up to 133 have pages describing the changes in each Firefox release that developers can target.
You can find everything in the Firefox release notes for developers pages.
Something you may not be aware of is that we also document Experimental features in Firefox.
This page describes features implemented in Firefox that are only available behind a preference (though configuration).
You can test out upcoming features before they are released, which is ideal if you're planning to use an experimental technology or if you're curious and would like to provide feedback on Bugzilla.Kicking off 2025The content projects that the team worked on were a superb learning experience, and we hope our readers benefit greatly from it.
If you want to make our docs better, let us know if there are other sections that need attention, and even lend your expertise.
If you want to learn about a topic, why not try to improve the documentation!
By contributing to MDN, you can improve your skills in a technology category, and millions of readers will benefit from it.
We're happy to share that we saw the following contributions in mdn/content GitHub repository in 2024:

915 different authors contributed.
~4300 pull requests opened.
~1500 issues opened.

We want to send out a big thanks to everyone who contributed in 2024 and we hope to see you continue in 2025.
One of the first larger changes we're excited to see is that JavaScript Temporal is coming with support scheduled to land in Firefox 135.
There is a huge pull request for Temporal authored by Josh-Cena, which means you can expect to be able to read Temporal documentation on MDN very soon.
We hope you enjoyed this post!

To summarize, the MDN Curriculum has been merged into Learn Web Development.
This post looks at the background leading up to this decision being made, what the changes mean specifically, and what updates you can expect to see in the future.Overview of learning material on MDNWe originally launched the MDN Learn Web Development section in 2016 with the aim of making MDN more accessible to non-experts and helping to take new web developers from "beginner to comfortable".
The content was pretty successful — by 2019 it was being used by over a million people per month to learn web development topics.
However, it was noted that the structure was sub-par:

The content had become bloated with topics that weren't really suitable for beginner web developers — either they were too advanced, or they were out of scope altogether.
Beginners tend to want a robust pathway they can follow to get the knowledge they need, rather than being expected to figure out what to learn and when.
Learners these days tend to want interactive multimedia content, not just text.
Developing the MDN curriculumTo solve the second issue highlighted above, we created a resource to help guide people towards learning a better skillset, making them more employable, and enabling them to build a better, more accessible, more responsible web of tomorrow.
As part of this project, we did substantial research to find out exactly what skills are seen as essential in new hires, and what the most common knowledge gaps are.
The resulting curriculum was intended to be useful as a study guide for self-learners, and a syllabus for educators to base courses on.
We also used it as a place to experiment with including interactive multimedia content via our learning partner, Scrimba.
We launched the MDN Curriculum in early 2024.Why the update?The curriculum was well-received by educators, but we quickly received feedback that users found it confusing having two learning resources on MDN, with the curriculum/learning pathway in one place and the learning content in another place.
In addition, the pathway was just a curriculum; learners still had to figure out what content to look at to achieve the learning objectives. And it did nothing to solve the first issue listed above — the content was still bloated.The new state of learning material on MDN
To provide a less confusing, more streamlined learning experience, we decided to merge the curriculum pathway into the MDN Learn Web Development section, restructuring it in the process. The results can be seen at the following new URL — developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn_web_development.

The most significant changes are as follows:

The articles now follow the same structure as the curriculum, with useful background and environment setup information in Getting started, the web fundamentals everyone should know in Core, and optional extra topics in Extensions. There is a clear pathway to follow between each article in the first two major sections, so readers know what to learn next at each stage.
In some cases, content was deemed not suitable for a beginner audience and has been repurposed as extensions/additional articles or migrated to other parts of MDN.
The specific learning outcomes detailed in the curriculum have been added to the top of the Getting started, Core, and some of the Extension articles, to match the learning outcomes detailed in the Curriculum.
Other features from the Curriculum have been migrated across to the Learn Web Development section, such as the About page and Resources for educators.

Initially, the Curriculum section will stay, however it will be merged into the Learn area over the next few iterations of this work and will be removed when it is felt the time is right.
We will keep a downloadable version as a resource for educators.What's next for learners on MDNMoving forward, we will continue to update the content and design to make Learn Web Development even more useful to learners and educators.
We are intending to give the article content a significant overhaul as we move into 2025. A lot of the content is timeless and does a good job of teaching the fundamentals, but the pacing is uneven, some of the articles are pretty long (which can be intimidating for beginners), and some of the challenges and examples have been around for a long time. Inspired by resources such as the content produced by our learning partner, Scrimba, we intend to shake our content up a bit to make it more fun, bite-size, and digestible.
We are also looking at improving the design of our learning pages, to echo the bright bold design we used on the curriculum and improve the experience further.
You can expect to see regular iterative improvements going forward, so watch this space.SummaryWe hope you find the new Learn Web Development content structure useful — have a look around and let us know what you think.
If you still have unanswered questions or wish to report issues, please get in touch via the usual communication channels.
If your issue concerns a specific piece of content, you might want to file a GitHub issue.Previous Post Countdown to the holidays with daily coding challengesNext Post MDN 2024 content projectsPrevious Post Countdown to the holidays with daily coding challengesNext Post MDN 2024 content projects\n\nIn this articleOverview of learning material on MDNDeveloping the MDN curriculumWhy the update?The new state of learning material on MDNWhat's next for learners on MDNSummaryA new learning experience on MDNRuth JohnDecember 20, 20244 minute readA major update to the MDN Learn Web Development section started in November 2024 and was finally published in December 2024.

I'm Yash, a UXE and a Senior Mentor of the Liquid Galaxy, where I work on GIS applications, making immersive data viz projects on Google Maps, Street View, and Earth. Liquid Galaxy is a Google-founded open-source project and was my primary reason for falling in love with open-source. I work on the web with HTML, CSS, and JS, and I believe that honing strong basics can make even the most complex tasks easy.
I still remember my first contribution to MDN. I was so proud of myself. Even though the fix was small, the cheer from Will Bamberg at the time meant a lot. It was for PWA docs, where I corrected that the iTunes value associated with the App Store for platform members of related apps has been dropped since it's currently not supported by Safari.
Since then, I have been lurking to find a way to contribute to MDN. I also contributed to web.dev to learn more. I am not new to MDN, W3C, or web.dev (HTML5Rocks), and have been learning like a nerd for the last 9 years, but a couple of years back, I started finally contributing. I felt like helping the community, making explainers, and I worked alongside people like Adam Argyle on a CSS motion blur proposal and Thomas Steiner (Project Fugu). I discovered, that when I put my passion and heart into something, I can achieve it. The grit to solve challenges isn't new to me.
My work at Liquid Galaxy, documentation, and creating an innovative UX to control Google Earth using Google Maps led me to get invited as a Speaker to Google, CA, USA, which was my first time outside India. I got to speak at Talks at Google, and most importantly, to network! I met Kristi Progri who was previously a Mozilla Representative, and I thought "that's so cool, I read MDN every day" and I was confident that I could get involved, too.
After an incredible journey to Google, knowing the roots of the Liquid Galaxy from 2008, I was mesmerized and was full of energy to do something, so I went to MDN and saw some small bugs like buttontext details, where I met Estelle Weyl (and I'm so thankful I did, as I had all the passion and pure knowledge waiting to test the waters). They helped me with the contributions by stating how buttontext for accessibility reasons will be fixed by filing a bug in WebKit. After some PRs like this, I mailed them asking to create an issue about the <model> tag. They told me it's still a WIP but there are some Baseline 'Widely Available' PRs I can contribute to. They trusted me, created a Google Sheet, and gave me edit access. And I delivered. The rest is history, I found my chance and took it, I knew Estelle because I had read her book on CSS, and was amazed to work alongside her on this. This sheet holds value to me and is the most up-to-date record of the work we are doing.
I love it because just think about how many future developers can be helped with it, those who truly learn like me and do not rely on crash courses to just get it "done". I thank Estelle for my journey and I want to stay in this community and help make MDN the library, a well-organized library I know it as, where you just know where each book is.Yash Raj BhartiMDN resonates with my passion to build a consistent and open web, where developers can learn and grow.How did you start using MDN?I started just like others, but using it as a source of learning, from those little tooltips that say "MDN reference" in VS Code, all the way to contributing and making the docs correct, wherever I can find a way to contribute, to hopefully be a part of it.What do you like about MDN?I like that it has all the implementation knowledge needed. When documenting, what I truly got to know from Will was, we are not just paraphrasing W3C specs, we are building it with an abstraction keeping in mind developers (and UXEs like me too) are our end users.Why do you contribute to Open Source or MDN?Anything open source is where we can ask "why should we not contribute"? There's all the reasons in the world to help and let everyone prosper, and that's what I love, whether it's for Google or Mozilla.What do you enjoy about contributing to MDN?I loved making DOMQuad as I was learning first hand and I believe I will become an encyclopedia as a by-product of helping others! That's rad.\n\n\n\nWeb technology for developersThe open Web presents incredible opportunities for developers. To take full advantage of these technologies, you need to know how to use them.

HTTP is the fundamental Internet protocol for fetching documents, stylesheets, scripts, images, videos, fonts, and other resources over the Web — and for sending data back to Web servers.

Media

Formats, codecs, protocols, APIs, and techniques for embedding and streaming video, audio, and image content in Web documents and apps.

SVG

Scalable Vector Graphics lets you create images that scale smoothly to any size.

MathML

MathML lets you display complex mathematical notation on the Web.

URI

Uniform Resource Identifiers are used by various technologies, including the browser itself via the address bar, to identify resources in various ways.

WebDriver

WebDriver is a browser-automation mechanism for remotely controlling a browser by emulating the actions of a real person using the browser. It's widely used for cross-browser testing of Web apps.

Web Extensions

Web Extensions are a way for you to give users enhanced capabilities in their browsers — for doing things such as blocking ads and other content, customizing the appearance of pages, and more.

Web App Manifests

Web App Manifests let you enable users to install Web apps to their device home screens, with aspects such as portrait/landscape screen orientation and display mode (e.g., full screen) pre-set.

Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)

Progressive Web Apps provide a user experience similar to native mobile apps.

OpenSearch

OpenSearch allows a website to describe a search engine for itself, so that a browser or other client application can use that search engine.

XML

The Extensible Markup Language is a strict serialization of the Document Object Model.

XSLT

Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations is an XML-based language used, in conjunction with specialized processing software, for the transformation of XML documents.

XPath

XPath uses a non-XML syntax to provide a flexible way of addressing (pointing to) different parts of an XML document. It can also be used to test addressed nodes within a document to determine whether they match a pattern or not.

EXSLT

EXSLT a set of extensions to XSLT.

Web Extensions are a way for you to give users enhanced capabilities in their browsers — for doing things such as blocking ads and other content, customizing the appearance of pages, and more.

Web App Manifests

Web App Manifests let you enable users to install Web apps to their device home screens, with aspects such as portrait/landscape screen orientation and display mode (e.g., full screen) pre-set.

Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)

Progressive Web Apps provide a user experience similar to native mobile apps.

OpenSearch

OpenSearch allows a website to describe a search engine for itself, so that a browser or other client application can use that search engine.

XML

The Extensible Markup Language is a strict serialization of the Document Object Model.

XSLT

Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations is an XML-based language used, in conjunction with specialized processing software, for the transformation of XML documents.

XPath

XPath uses a non-XML syntax to provide a flexible way of addressing (pointing to) different parts of an XML document. It can also be used to test addressed nodes within a document to determine whether they match a pattern or not.

EXSLT

EXSLT a set of extensions to XSLT.

These can arise from user interactions such as using a mouse or resizing a window, changes in the state of the underlying environment (e.g., low battery or media events from the operating system), and other causes.
Each event is represented by an object that is based on the Event interface, and may have additional custom fields and/or functions to provide information about what happened. The documentation for every event has a table (near the top) that includes a link to the associated event interface, and other relevant information. A full list of the different event types is given in Event > Interfaces based on Event.
This topic provides an index to the main sorts of events you might be interested in (animation, clipboard, workers etc.) along with the main classes that implement those sorts of events.Event index

SpecificationsSpecificationHTML # events-2\n\nEvent referenceEvents are fired to notify code of "interesting changes" that may affect code execution. These can arise from user interactions such as using a mouse or resizing a window, changes in the state of the underlying environment (e.g., low battery or media events from the operating system), and other causes.
Each event is represented by an object that is based on the Event interface, and may have additional custom fields and/or functions to provide information about what happened. The documentation for every event has a table (near the top) that includes a link to the associated event interface, and other relevant information. A full list of the different event types is given in Event > Interfaces based on Event.
This topic provides an index to the main sorts of events you might be interested in (animation, clipboard, workers etc.) along with the main classes that implement those sorts of events.Event index

These can arise from user interactions such as using a mouse or resizing a window, changes in the state of the underlying environment (e.g., low battery or media events from the operating system), and other causes.
Each event is represented by an object that is based on the Event interface, and may have additional custom fields and/or functions to provide information about what happened. The documentation for every event has a table (near the top) that includes a link to the associated event interface, and other relevant information. A full list of the different event types is given in Event > Interfaces based on Event.
This topic provides an index to the main sorts of events you might be interested in (animation, clipboard, workers etc.) along with the main classes that implement those sorts of events.Event index

This feature might not work in older devices or browsers.Learn moreSee full compatibilityReport feedbackMathematical Markup Language (MathML) is an XML-based language for describing mathematical notation.
MathML was originally designed as a general-purpose specification for browsers, office suites, computer algebra systems, EPUB readers, LaTeX-based generators. However, this approach was not very adapted to the Web: the subset focusing on semantics has never been implemented in browsers while the subset focusing on math layout led to incomplete and inconsistent browser implementations.
MathML Core is a subset with increased implementation details based on rules from LaTeX and the Open Font Format. It is tailored for browsers and designed specifically to work well with other web standards including HTML, CSS, DOM, JavaScript.
Below you will find links to documentation, examples, and tools to work with MathML. MDN uses MathML Core as a reference specification but, due to an erratic standardization history, legacy MathML features may still show up in existing implementations and web content.

Note:
It is highly recommended that developers and authors switch to MathML Core, perhaps relying on other web technologies to cover missing use cases. The Math WG is maintaining a set of MathML polyfills to facilitate that transition.
TutorialsThe MathML tutorials are designed to walk you through topics assuming that you have no prior experience, starting from the basics and progressing to more advanced techniques.

MathML for beginners

This tutorial will guide you through creating math formulas using structured markup. It starts with an introduction to adding MathML to an HTML document, followed by a deep dive into key components: fractions and roots, scripted elements, and text containers.

SpecificationsSpecificationMathematical Markup Language (MathML) Version 4.0 Browser compatibility\n\nMathMLBaseline 2023Newly availableSince January 2023, this feature works across the latest devices and browser versions. This feature might not work in older devices or browsers.Learn moreSee full compatibilityReport feedbackMathematical Markup Language (MathML) is an XML-based language for describing mathematical notation.
MathML was originally designed as a general-purpose specification for browsers, office suites, computer algebra systems, EPUB readers, LaTeX-based generators. However, this approach was not very adapted to the Web: the subset focusing on semantics has never been implemented in browsers while the subset focusing on math layout led to incomplete and inconsistent browser implementations.
MathML Core is a subset with increased implementation details based on rules from LaTeX and the Open Font Format. It is tailored for browsers and designed specifically to work well with other web standards including HTML, CSS, DOM, JavaScript.
Below you will find links to documentation, examples, and tools to work with MathML. MDN uses MathML Core as a reference specification but, due to an erratic standardization history, legacy MathML features may still show up in existing implementations and web content.

Note:
It is highly recommended that developers and authors switch to MathML Core, perhaps relying on other web technologies to cover missing use cases. The Math WG is maintaining a set of MathML polyfills to facilitate that transition.
TutorialsThe MathML tutorials are designed to walk you through topics assuming that you have no prior experience, starting from the basics and progressing to more advanced techniques.

MathML for beginners

This tutorial will guide you through creating math formulas using structured markup. It starts with an introduction to adding MathML to an HTML document, followed by a deep dive into key components: fractions and roots, scripted elements, and text containers.

There are now a large number of APIs, as well as HTML elements, DOM interfaces, and other features that make it possible to work with media in exciting and immersive ways.
This article lists guides and references for various features you may use when incorporating media into your projects.GuidesThe Media guides are resources that help you understand, transform, and optimize media on the web, including audio, video, and images using modern web technologies.

Audio and Video Delivery

We can deliver audio and video on the web in a number of ways, ranging from 'static' media files to adaptive live streams. This article is intended as a starting point for exploring the various delivery mechanisms of web-based media and compatibility with popular browsers.

Audio and Video manipulation

Having native audio and video in the browser means we can use these data streams with technologies such as <canvas>, WebGL or Web Audio API to modify audio and video directly, for example adding reverb/compression effects to audio, or grayscale/sepia filters to video.

Autoplay guide for media and Web Audio APIs

Unexpected automatic playback of media or audio can be an unwelcome surprise to users. While autoplay serves a purpose, it should be used carefully. To give users control over this, many browsers now provide forms of autoplay blocking. This article is a guide to autoplay, with tips on when and how to use it and how to work with browsers to handle autoplay blocking gracefully.

DASH Adaptive Streaming for HTML 5 Video

Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) is an adaptive streaming protocol. This means that it allows for a video stream to switch between bit rates on the basis of network performance, in order to keep a video playing.

Streaming audio and video

A guide which covers how to stream audio and video, as well as techniques and technologies you can take advantage of to ensure the best possible quality and/or performance of your streams.

Media types and formats on the web

A guide to the file types and codecs available for images, audio, and video media on the web. This includes recommendations for what formats to use for what kinds of content, best practices including how to provide fallbacks and how to prioritize media types, and also includes general browser support information for each media container and codec.

Using images in HTML

A guide to adding images to websites that are responsive, accessible, and performant.

ReferencesHTMLThe following HTML elements are used for including media on a page.

<audio>

The <audio> element is used to play audio. These can be used invisibly as a destination for more complex media, or with visible controls for user-controlled playback of audio files. Accessible from JavaScript as HTMLAudioElement objects.

<video>

The <video> element is used to play video content. It can be used to present video files, or as a destination for streamed video content. <video> can also be used as a way to link media APIs with other HTML and DOM technologies, including <canvas> (for frame grabbing and manipulation), for example. It is accessible from JavaScript as HTMLVideoElement objects.

<track>

The HTML <track> element can be placed within an <audio> or <video> element to provide a reference to a WebVTT format subtitle or caption track to be used when playing the media. Accessible from JavaScript as HTMLTrackElement objects.

<source>

The HTML <source> element is used within an <audio> or <video> element to specify source media to present. Multiple sources can be used to provide the media in different formats, sizes, or resolutions. Accessible from JavaScript as HTMLSourceElement objects.

APIs
Media Capabilities API

The Media Capabilities API lets you determine the encoding and decoding capabilities of the device your app or site is running on. This lets you make real-time decisions about what formats to use and when.

Media Capture and Streams API

A reference for the API which makes it possible to stream, record, and manipulate media both locally and across a network. This includes using local cameras and microphones to capture video, audio, and still images.

Media Session API

The Media Session API provides a way to customize media notifications. It does this by providing metadata for display by the user agent for the media your web app is playing. It also provides action handlers that the browser can use to access platform media keys such as hardware keys found on keyboards, headsets, remote controls, and software keys found in notification areas and on lock screens of mobile devices.

MediaStream Recording API

The MediaStream Recording API lets you capture media streams to process or filter the data or record it to disk.

Web Audio API

The Web Audio API lets you generate, filter, and manipulate sound data both in real-time and on pre-recorded material, then send that audio to a destination such as an <audio> element, a media stream, or to disk.

WebRTC

WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) makes it possible to stream live audio and video, as well as transfer arbitrary data, between two peers over the Internet, without requiring an intermediary.

Related topicsRelated topics which may be of interest, since they can be used in tandem with media APIs in interesting ways.

Accessible multimedia

In this guide, we cover ways web designers and developers can create content that is accessible to people with different capabilities. This ranges from using the alt attribute on <img> elements to captions to tagging media for screen readers.

Canvas API

The Canvas API lets you draw into an <canvas>, manipulating and changing the contents of an image. This can be used with media in many ways, including by setting a <canvas> element as the destination for video playback or camera capture so that you can capture and manipulate video frames.

WebGL

WebGL provides an OpenGL ES compatible API on top of the existing Canvas API, making it possible to do powerful 3D graphics on the Web. Through a canvas, this can be used to add 3D imagery to media content.

WebXR

In doing so, they are required to share personal information with those sites. Users place a certain level of trust in the sites they share their data with. If that information fell into the wrong hands, it could be used to exploit users, for example by profiling them, targeting them with unwanted ads, or even stealing their identity or money.
Modern browsers already have a wealth of features to protect users' privacy on the web, but that's not enough. To create a trustworthy and privacy-respecting experience, developers need to educate their site users in good practices (and enforce them). Developers should also create sites that collect as little data from users as possible, use the data responsibly, and transport and store it securely.
In this article, we:

Define privacy and important related terms.
Examine browser features that automatically protect user privacy.
Look at what developers can do to create privacy-respecting web content that minimizes the risk of users' personal information/data being obtained unexpectedly by third parties.
Defining privacy terms and conceptsBefore we look at the various privacy and security features available to use on the web, let's define some important terms.Privacy and its relationship with securityIt is hard to talk about privacy without also talking about security — they are closely related, and you can't really create privacy-respecting websites without good security. Therefore, we shall define both.


Privacy refers to the act of giving users the right to control how their data is collected, stored, and used, and not using it irresponsibly. For example, you should clearly communicate to your users what data you are collecting, who it will be shared with, and how it will be used. Users must be given a chance to consent to your terms of data usage, have access to all of their data that you are storing, and delete it if they no longer wish you to have it. You must also comply with your own terms: nothing erodes user trust like having their data used and shared in ways they never consented to. And this isn't just ethically wrong; it could be against the law. Many parts of the world now have legislation that protects consumer privacy rights (for example the EU's GDPR).


Security is the act of keeping private data and systems protected against unauthorized access. This includes both company (internal) data, and user and partner (external) data. It is no use having a robust privacy policy that makes your users trust you if your security is weak and malicious parties can steal their data anyway.

Personal and private informationPersonal information is any information that describes a user. Examples include:

Postal address, email address, phone number, or other contact information
Passport number, bank account, credit card, social security number, or other official identifiers
Physical attributes such as height, gender expression, weight, hair color, or age
Health information such as medical history, allergies, or ongoing conditions
Usernames, when they can be linked to an individual
Hobbies, interests, or other personal preferences
Biometric data such as fingerprints or facial recognition data

Private information is any information that users do not want shared publicly and must be kept private (i.e., information that is accessible only by a certain group of authorized users). Some private data is private by law (for example medical data), and some is private more by personal preference.Personally identifiable informationFollowing on from the above section, personally identifiable information (PII) is information that can be used, in whole or in part, to track down and/or identify a specific person. For example, if a site leaks a list of users' names and zip codes online, a bad actor could almost certainly use this information to find their full addresses. Even if a full-scale leak does not happen, it is still possible to identify users through less obvious means, such as the browsers they are using, the devices they are using, specific fonts they have installed, and so on.TrackingTracking refers to the process of recording a user's activity across many different websites. This can be done in various ways, for example:

Looking at multiple third-party cookies set across different sites where third-party content is embedded to find out various information points about the user.
Looking at the Referer header to see where a user has navigated from.
Including parameters on the URLs of inbound links (for example in embedded ads linking to product pages, or marketing emails) that can reveal to the linked site where the link originated from, what marketing campaign it is part of, the email address or other identifier of the user that clicked on it, etc. This process is referred to as link decorating, and results in link URLs that look like this: https://example.com/article/?id=62yhgt1a&campaign=902.
Redirect tracking, which involves trackers momentarily (and imperceptibly) redirecting a user to their website to use first-party storage to track that user across websites. This allows trackers to get around third-party cookies being blocked. For example, if you have read a product review and want to click through to buy it, you might unwittingly navigate to the redirect tracker first, then to the retailer. This means the tracker is loaded as a first party, and can associate tracking data with the identifiers they have stored in their first-party cookies before forwarding you to the retailer.

Tracking data can be used to build a profile of a user and their interests and preferences, which is usually bad and can be annoying to various degrees. For example:

Targeted ads: Everyone has had the unnerving experience of researching some items to buy on one device and then suddenly being bombarded by adverts for the same products on all their other devices.
Selling or sharing data: Some third parties have been known to compile tracking data and then sell it to/share it with others to use for various purposes, like targeted ads. This is obviously highly unethical and may also be illegal, depending on where in the world it happens.
Prejudice via data: In the worst cases, sharing data could result in the user being unfairly disadvantaged. For example, imagine an insurance company finding out data points about a potential customer that they didn't consent to share, and using them as a justification for increasing insurance premiums.
FingerprintingA process very closely related to tracking is fingerprinting: this specifically refers to identifying users by building up a store of data points about them that differentiate them from other users. This could be anything from cookie contents to what browser they are using and what fonts they have installed locally.
Modern browsers take steps to help prevent fingerprinting-based attacks by either not allowing information to be accessed or, where the information must be made available, by introducing variations or "noise" that prevent it from being used for identification purposes.
For example, if a website queries a user's browser for the elapsed time, a comparison of that time to the time reported by the server might be useful as a factor in fingerprinting. Because of this, browsers typically introduce a small amount of variability to timers to make them less useful for identifying the user's system.

Note:
See Fingerprinting on web.dev for additional useful information.
Privacy features provided by browsersBrowser vendors are aware of the need to protect user privacy and the negative effects of tracking, fingerprinting, etc., on user experience. To this end, they have implemented various features that enhance privacy protection and/or mitigate threats. In this section, we look at different categories of privacy protection that browsers apply automatically.HTTPS by defaultTransport Layer Security (TLS) provides security and privacy by encrypting data during transport over the network and is the technology behind the HTTPS protocol. TLS is good for privacy because it stops third parties from being able to intercept transmitted data and use it maliciously, for example for tracking.
All browsers are moving towards requiring HTTPS by default; this is practically the case already because you can't do much on the web without this protocol.
Related topics are as follows:

Certificate Transparency

An open standard for monitoring and auditing certificates, creating a database of public logs that can be used to help identify incorrect or malicious certificates.

HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)

HSTS is used by servers to let them protect themselves from protocol downgrade and cookie hijack attacks by letting sites tell clients that they can only use HTTPS to communicate with the server.

HTTP/2

While HTTP/2 technically does not have to use encryption, most browser developers support it only when used with HTTPS; so in that regard, it can be thought of as a feature to enhance security/privacy.

Opt-in for "powerful features"So-called "powerful" web API features that provide access to potentially sensitive data and operations are available only in secure contexts, which basically means HTTPS-only. Not only that, but these web features are gated behind a system of user permissions. Users have to explicitly opt in to features like allowing notifications, accessing geolocation data, making the browser go into fullscreen mode, accessing media streams from webcams, using web payments, etc.Anti-tracking technologyBrowsers have implemented several anti-tracking features that automatically enhance their users' privacy protection. Many of these block or limit the ability of third-party sites embedded in <iframe>s to access cookies set on the top-level domain, run tracking scripts, etc.

The Set-Cookie header SameSite attribute's default value has been updated to Lax, to provide better protection against tracking and CSRF attacks. See Controlling third-party cookies with SameSite for more information.
Browsers have all started to block third-party cookies by default. See How do browsers handle third-party cookies? for more details.
Browsers are implementing technologies to allow third-party cookies only in certain circumstances that do not damage privacy, or to implement common use cases that currently require third-party cookies in alternative ways. See Transitioning from third-party cookies and Replacing third-party cookies.
Several browsers strip out known tracking parameters from URLs — this includes Firefox, Safari, and Brave. Browser extensions also help to do this, for example ClearURLs.
Browsers have implemented redirect tracking protection.
Privacy considerations for client-side developersThere are several actions web developers can and should take to improve privacy for their users. The below sections discuss the most important ones. Some of the categories are not purely technical tasks as such and will involve collaboration with other team members.Collect data ethicallyCompanies collect lots of different data from their users for a variety of different reasons:

Usernames, passwords, emails, etc. for authentication purposes.
Emails, postal addresses, and phone numbers for communication.
Age, gender, geographical location, favorite pastimes, and a host of other PII for anything from site personalization to customer satisfaction surveys.
Browsing habits on their sites and other sites, to measure page and feature success metrics.
And so much more.

When collecting data from your customers, you have an opportunity to behave with integrity, show them that you are trustworthy, and build a great relationship with them, in turn, improving your brand and your chance of success.
The ethics of data collection can be broken down into three simple principles:

Don't collect more data than you need
Communicate clearly how you are going to use the data you collect
Delete the data once you have finished with it


Note:
The tips provided below make for a better, more privacy-aware user experience, but many of them are required by law to comply with regulations, for example the GDPR in the EU. You should make sure to find out what regulations apply to you in your locale, and what you need to do to comply with them.
Don't collect more data than you needIt is tempting to ask for a lot of data from your users because you think it might be useful in the future. However, every bit of extra data you collect adds risk to your users' privacy and increases the chance that they will abandon the step they are performing (whether it is filling out a survey or signing up for a service).
It is good to anonymize data. You should also consider whether you can get what you need by making your data request less granular. As an example, instead of asking a user their favorite products, you could ask them to select between more general categories.
The best way to protect user privacy though, is to minimize the data you collect. Referring to the previous example, you could infer the same data by looking at user purchase history. As another example, users appreciate being able to buy products anonymously. You shouldn't force them to sign up for an account; if it's not necessary for the service to operate, it should be their choice.Communicate clearly how you are going to use the data you collectOnce you have decided what data you are going to collect, you should publish a privacy policy on your site that clearly states:

Data that you collect
Ways in which you use the data
Parties with whom you tend to share the data, if at all, and a declaration that you will ask for user consent before sharing
The duration for which you keep the data before it is deleted
Ways in which users can view the data you have collected from them and delete it if they want to

When providing you with data, your users should be given an opportunity to read your privacy policy, and consent to it. They should be able to control if they are happy with this and agree to your terms. And as indicated above, they should also get to see what data of theirs you have collected, and delete it if they want to.
When you've published your privacy policy, you need to make sure that you comply with it — doing what you say you are going to do is very important in building user trust. You should only collect the data you say you'll collect, and only use it for the purpose you say you'll use it for. If someone from your company comes up with a clever new way to use existing data, that still isn't OK under the terms of your policy if it doesn't specify that you'll use it for that purpose. If users consented to the use of their data for a specific purpose and that purpose expands, you may have to consider obtaining new consent.Delete the data once you have finished with itEarlier on, we mentioned giving users a way to see what data of theirs you have collected, and delete it if they want to. You could possibly do this as part of the same experience they can use to delete their account (their data goes with it), or make them two separate options. Either way, the options should be easy to find.
Allowing the user to choose when significant portions of data get deleted is very empowering, and builds trust, but there may be some bits of data that you will want to handle deletion of yourself. For example, some data might only be used for a few hours or minutes and then deleted, like data that is used during the administration of a user's session while they are logged in.

Note:
The Clear-Site-Data HTTP response header is very useful for clearing short-lived user data — it instructs the browser to clear out its cache and/or cookies and/or storage (e.g., Web Storage or IndexedDB data). For example, you might get your server to send it along with a "logged out confirmation" page so that once the user is logged out, their data is safely removed.
Cut down on trackingEarlier on we discussed tracking, and some of the unethical purposes it is used for. We shouldn't have to spell out how such uses can erode user trust; wherever possible, you should only use potential tracking mechanisms like third-party cookies for ethical uses, such as transferring sign-in or other personalization status across sites.
Also recall from earlier that browsers are all starting to block third-party cookies by default, while implementing alternative technologies to achieve common use case. It is a good idea to prepare for this, by limiting the amount of tracking activities you rely on, and/or implementing desired information persistence in other ways. See Transitioning from third-party cookies for more information.Carefully manage third-party resourcesOf course, it would be easy to manage privacy if you were only worried about resources you have created (code, cookies, sites, etc.). The real challenge comes from the fact that your site will likely use third-party resources. This can include third-party content embedded in <iframe>s, libraries, frameworks, APIs, externally-hosted resources such as images and videos, etc.
Third-party resources are an essential part of modern web development, they provide a lot of power. However, any third-party resource you allow onto your site potentially has the same permissions as your own resources; it all depends on how it is included on your site:

JavaScript running inside third-party content embedded in your site via an <iframe> is separated by same-origin policy, meaning that it wouldn't have access to other scripts and data included in the top-level browsing context.
However, a third-party script included directly in your page via a <script> element would have access to your other scripts and data, whether it was hosted on your site or another site. It would effectively be first-party code. A malicious script included in this way could secretly steal your users' data, for example sending it off to a third-party server.

It is important to audit all of the third-party resources you use on your site. Make sure you know what data they collect, what requests they make and to whom, and what their privacy policies are. Your carefully designed privacy policy is useless if you use a third-party script that violates it.

Note:
There are various tools out there that can help you build up a picture of what requests a site is making, for example the Request Map Generator.

Once you have audited your third-party resources and understand what they are doing, you should then consider their negatives as a trade-off for the value they bring. If a third-party script is free and really useful but collects quite a lot of user data, you could:

Accept that trade-off, update your privacy policy to include details of it, and hope that it doesn't impact your users' trust too much.
Look for an alternative, less data-hungry third-party tool.
Build your own tool.

The following list provides some tips on how to mitigate privacy risks inherent with using third-party resources:


When embedding third-party resources, consider if there is a way to achieve the same or a similar effect with less privacy impact. For example, it might be fun to have a social media post viewer embedded on your site, but is it really necessary? Wouldn't a link to your social media page be sufficient? Also, some third-party services have privacy-enhancing options. See, for example, YouTube's Embed videos & playlists > Turn on privacy-enhanced mode.


Where possible, you should block third parties from receiving a Referer header when you make requests to them. This can be done in a pretty granular way, for example by including rel="noreferrer" on external links. Or, you could set this more globally for the page or site, for example by using the Referrer-Policy header.

Note:
See also Referer header: privacy and security concerns.



Use the Permissions-Policy HTTP header to control access to API "powerful features" (such as notifications, geolocation data, accessing media streams from webcams, etc.). This can be useful for privacy because it stops third-party sites from doing unexpected things with these features, and users don't want to be unnecessarily bombarded by permission prompts that they may not understand. You can also control usage of "powerful features" inside third-party sites embedded inside <iframe> elements by specifying permissions policies inside an allow attribute on the <iframe> itself.

Note:
See also our Permissions-Policy guide for more information and examples, and permissionspolicy.com for useful tools including a policy generator.



Use the <iframe> sandbox attribute to allow or disallow usage of certain features inside the content embedded in the <iframe> — this includes things like downloads, form submissions, modals, and scripting.



Note:
See Third parties over on web.dev for additional useful information on auditing and more.
Protect user dataYou need to make sure that user data is transmitted and stored securely once you've collected it. This is more of a security topic, but it is worth mentioning here — a good privacy policy is useless if your security is lax and attackers can steal the data from you.
The below tips offer some guidance on protecting your user's data:

Security is hard to get right. When implementing a secure solution that involves data collection — particularly if it is sensitive data such as sign-in credentials — it makes sense to use a reputable solution from a well-respected provider. For example, any respectable server-side framework will have built-in features to protect against common vulnerabilities. You could also consider using a specialized product for your purpose — for example an identity provider solution, or a secure online survey provider.
If you want to roll out your own solution for collecting user data, make sure you understand what you are doing. Hire an experienced server-side developer and/or security engineer to implement the system, and ensure it is tested thoroughly. Use multifactor authentication (MFA) to provide better protection. Consider using a dedicated API such as Web Authentication or Federated Credential Management to streamline the client-side of the app.
When collecting user sign-up information, enforce strong passwords so your user's account details cannot be easily guessed. Weak passwords are one of the main causes of security breaches. Encourage your users to use a password manager to generate and store complex passwords; this way they won't worry about remembering them, or create a security risk by writing them down.
Don't include sensitive data in URLs — if a third party intercepts the URL (for example via the Referer header), they could steal that information. Use POST requests rather than GET requests to avoid this.
Consider using tools like Content Security Policy and Permissions Policy to enforce a set of feature usage on your site that makes it harder to introduce vulnerabilities. Be careful when doing this — if you block usage of a feature that a third-party script relies on to work, you may end up breaking your site's functionality. This is something you can look into when auditing your third-party resources (see Carefully manage third-party resources).

The Privacy Sandbox on privacysandbox.google.com
Lean Data Practices on mozilla.org\n\nPrivacy on the webPeople use websites for several important tasks such as banking, shopping, entertainment, and paying their taxes. In doing so, they are required to share personal information with those sites. Users place a certain level of trust in the sites they share their data with. If that information fell into the wrong hands, it could be used to exploit users, for example by profiling them, targeting them with unwanted ads, or even stealing their identity or money.
Modern browsers already have a wealth of features to protect users' privacy on the web, but that's not enough. To create a trustworthy and privacy-respecting experience, developers need to educate their site users in good practices (and enforce them). Developers should also create sites that collect as little data from users as possible, use the data responsibly, and transport and store it securely.
In this article, we:

Define privacy and important related terms.
Examine browser features that automatically protect user privacy.
Look at what developers can do to create privacy-respecting web content that minimizes the risk of users' personal information/data being obtained unexpectedly by third parties.
Defining privacy terms and conceptsBefore we look at the various privacy and security features available to use on the web, let's define some important terms.Privacy and its relationship with securityIt is hard to talk about privacy without also talking about security — they are closely related, and you can't really create privacy-respecting websites without good security. Therefore, we shall define both.


Privacy refers to the act of giving users the right to control how their data is collected, stored, and used, and not using it irresponsibly. For example, you should clearly communicate to your users what data you are collecting, who it will be shared with, and how it will be used. Users must be given a chance to consent to your terms of data usage, have access to all of their data that you are storing, and delete it if they no longer wish you to have it. You must also comply with your own terms: nothing erodes user trust like having their data used and shared in ways they never consented to. And this isn't just ethically wrong; it could be against the law. Many parts of the world now have legislation that protects consumer privacy rights (for example the EU's GDPR).


Security is the act of keeping private data and systems protected against unauthorized access. This includes both company (internal) data, and user and partner (external) data. It is no use having a robust privacy policy that makes your users trust you if your security is weak and malicious parties can steal their data anyway.

Personal and private informationPersonal information is any information that describes a user. Examples include:

Postal address, email address, phone number, or other contact information
Passport number, bank account, credit card, social security number, or other official identifiers
Physical attributes such as height, gender expression, weight, hair color, or age
Health information such as medical history, allergies, or ongoing conditions
Usernames, when they can be linked to an individual
Hobbies, interests, or other personal preferences
Biometric data such as fingerprints or facial recognition data

Private information is any information that users do not want shared publicly and must be kept private (i.e., information that is accessible only by a certain group of authorized users). Some private data is private by law (for example medical data), and some is private more by personal preference.Personally identifiable informationFollowing on from the above section, personally identifiable information (PII) is information that can be used, in whole or in part, to track down and/or identify a specific person. For example, if a site leaks a list of users' names and zip codes online, a bad actor could almost certainly use this information to find their full addresses. Even if a full-scale leak does not happen, it is still possible to identify users through less obvious means, such as the browsers they are using, the devices they are using, specific fonts they have installed, and so on.TrackingTracking refers to the process of recording a user's activity across many different websites. This can be done in various ways, for example:

Looking at multiple third-party cookies set across different sites where third-party content is embedded to find out various information points about the user.
Looking at the Referer header to see where a user has navigated from.
Including parameters on the URLs of inbound links (for example in embedded ads linking to product pages, or marketing emails) that can reveal to the linked site where the link originated from, what marketing campaign it is part of, the email address or other identifier of the user that clicked on it, etc. This process is referred to as link decorating, and results in link URLs that look like this: https://example.com/article/?id=62yhgt1a&campaign=902.
Redirect tracking, which involves trackers momentarily (and imperceptibly) redirecting a user to their website to use first-party storage to track that user across websites. This allows trackers to get around third-party cookies being blocked. For example, if you have read a product review and want to click through to buy it, you might unwittingly navigate to the redirect tracker first, then to the retailer.

The following list provides some tips on how to mitigate privacy risks inherent with using third-party resources:


When embedding third-party resources, consider if there is a way to achieve the same or a similar effect with less privacy impact. For example, it might be fun to have a social media post viewer embedded on your site, but is it really necessary? Wouldn't a link to your social media page be sufficient? Also, some third-party services have privacy-enhancing options. See, for example, YouTube's Embed videos & playlists > Turn on privacy-enhanced mode.


Where possible, you should block third parties from receiving a Referer header when you make requests to them. This can be done in a pretty granular way, for example by including rel="noreferrer" on external links. Or, you could set this more globally for the page or site, for example by using the Referrer-Policy header.

Note:
See also Referer header: privacy and security concerns.



Use the Permissions-Policy HTTP header to control access to API "powerful features" (such as notifications, geolocation data, accessing media streams from webcams, etc.). This can be useful for privacy because it stops third-party sites from doing unexpected things with these features, and users don't want to be unnecessarily bombarded by permission prompts that they may not understand. You can also control usage of "powerful features" inside third-party sites embedded inside <iframe> elements by specifying permissions policies inside an allow attribute on the <iframe> itself.

Note:
See also our Permissions-Policy guide for more information and examples, and permissionspolicy.com for useful tools including a policy generator.



Use the <iframe> sandbox attribute to allow or disallow usage of certain features inside the content embedded in the <iframe> — this includes things like downloads, form submissions, modals, and scripting.



Note:
See Third parties over on web.dev for additional useful information on auditing and more.
Protect user dataYou need to make sure that user data is transmitted and stored securely once you've collected it. This is more of a security topic, but it is worth mentioning here — a good privacy policy is useless if your security is lax and attackers can steal the data from you.
The below tips offer some guidance on protecting your user's data:

Security is hard to get right. When implementing a secure solution that involves data collection — particularly if it is sensitive data such as sign-in credentials — it makes sense to use a reputable solution from a well-respected provider. For example, any respectable server-side framework will have built-in features to protect against common vulnerabilities. You could also consider using a specialized product for your purpose — for example an identity provider solution, or a secure online survey provider.
If you want to roll out your own solution for collecting user data, make sure you understand what you are doing. Hire an experienced server-side developer and/or security engineer to implement the system, and ensure it is tested thoroughly. Use multifactor authentication (MFA) to provide better protection. Consider using a dedicated API such as Web Authentication or Federated Credential Management to streamline the client-side of the app.
When collecting user sign-up information, enforce strong passwords so your user's account details cannot be easily guessed. Weak passwords are one of the main causes of security breaches. Encourage your users to use a password manager to generate and store complex passwords; this way they won't worry about remembering them, or create a security risk by writing them down.
Don't include sensitive data in URLs — if a third party intercepts the URL (for example via the Referer header), they could steal that information. Use POST requests rather than GET requests to avoid this.
Consider using tools like Content Security Policy and Permissions Policy to enforce a set of feature usage on your site that makes it harder to introduce vulnerabilities. Be careful when doing this — if you block usage of a feature that a third-party script relies on to work, you may end up breaking your site's functionality. This is something you can look into when auditing your third-party resources (see Carefully manage third-party resources).

In doing so, they are required to share personal information with those sites. Users place a certain level of trust in the sites they share their data with. If that information fell into the wrong hands, it could be used to exploit users, for example by profiling them, targeting them with unwanted ads, or even stealing their identity or money.
Modern browsers already have a wealth of features to protect users' privacy on the web, but that's not enough. To create a trustworthy and privacy-respecting experience, developers need to educate their site users in good practices (and enforce them). Developers should also create sites that collect as little data from users as possible, use the data responsibly, and transport and store it securely.
In this article, we:

Define privacy and important related terms.
Examine browser features that automatically protect user privacy.
Look at what developers can do to create privacy-respecting web content that minimizes the risk of users' personal information/data being obtained unexpectedly by third parties.
Defining privacy terms and conceptsBefore we look at the various privacy and security features available to use on the web, let's define some important terms.Privacy and its relationship with securityIt is hard to talk about privacy without also talking about security — they are closely related, and you can't really create privacy-respecting websites without good security. Therefore, we shall define both.


Privacy refers to the act of giving users the right to control how their data is collected, stored, and used, and not using it irresponsibly. For example, you should clearly communicate to your users what data you are collecting, who it will be shared with, and how it will be used. Users must be given a chance to consent to your terms of data usage, have access to all of their data that you are storing, and delete it if they no longer wish you to have it. You must also comply with your own terms: nothing erodes user trust like having their data used and shared in ways they never consented to. And this isn't just ethically wrong; it could be against the law. Many parts of the world now have legislation that protects consumer privacy rights (for example the EU's GDPR).


Security is the act of keeping private data and systems protected against unauthorized access. This includes both company (internal) data, and user and partner (external) data. It is no use having a robust privacy policy that makes your users trust you if your security is weak and malicious parties can steal their data anyway.

Personal and private informationPersonal information is any information that describes a user. Examples include:

Postal address, email address, phone number, or other contact information
Passport number, bank account, credit card, social security number, or other official identifiers
Physical attributes such as height, gender expression, weight, hair color, or age
Health information such as medical history, allergies, or ongoing conditions
Usernames, when they can be linked to an individual
Hobbies, interests, or other personal preferences
Biometric data such as fingerprints or facial recognition data

Private information is any information that users do not want shared publicly and must be kept private (i.e., information that is accessible only by a certain group of authorized users). Some private data is private by law (for example medical data), and some is private more by personal preference.Personally identifiable informationFollowing on from the above section, personally identifiable information (PII) is information that can be used, in whole or in part, to track down and/or identify a specific person. For example, if a site leaks a list of users' names and zip codes online, a bad actor could almost certainly use this information to find their full addresses. Even if a full-scale leak does not happen, it is still possible to identify users through less obvious means, such as the browsers they are using, the devices they are using, specific fonts they have installed, and so on.TrackingTracking refers to the process of recording a user's activity across many different websites. This can be done in various ways, for example:

Looking at multiple third-party cookies set across different sites where third-party content is embedded to find out various information points about the user.
Looking at the Referer header to see where a user has navigated from.
Including parameters on the URLs of inbound links (for example in embedded ads linking to product pages, or marketing emails) that can reveal to the linked site where the link originated from, what marketing campaign it is part of, the email address or other identifier of the user that clicked on it, etc. This process is referred to as link decorating, and results in link URLs that look like this: https://example.com/article/?id=62yhgt1a&campaign=902.
Redirect tracking, which involves trackers momentarily (and imperceptibly) redirecting a user to their website to use first-party storage to track that user across websites. This allows trackers to get around third-party cookies being blocked. For example, if you have read a product review and want to click through to buy it, you might unwittingly navigate to the redirect tracker first, then to the retailer. This means the tracker is loaded as a first party, and can associate tracking data with the identifiers they have stored in their first-party cookies before forwarding you to the retailer.

Tracking data can be used to build a profile of a user and their interests and preferences, which is usually bad and can be annoying to various degrees. For example:

Targeted ads: Everyone has had the unnerving experience of researching some items to buy on one device and then suddenly being bombarded by adverts for the same products on all their other devices.
Selling or sharing data: Some third parties have been known to compile tracking data and then sell it to/share it with others to use for various purposes, like targeted ads. This is obviously highly unethical and may also be illegal, depending on where in the world it happens.
Prejudice via data: In the worst cases, sharing data could result in the user being unfairly disadvantaged. For example, imagine an insurance company finding out data points about a potential customer that they didn't consent to share, and using them as a justification for increasing insurance premiums.
FingerprintingA process very closely related to tracking is fingerprinting: this specifically refers to identifying users by building up a store of data points about them that differentiate them from other users. This could be anything from cookie contents to what browser they are using and what fonts they have installed locally.
Modern browsers take steps to help prevent fingerprinting-based attacks by either not allowing information to be accessed or, where the information must be made available, by introducing variations or "noise" that prevent it from being used for identification purposes.
For example, if a website queries a user's browser for the elapsed time, a comparison of that time to the time reported by the server might be useful as a factor in fingerprinting. Because of this, browsers typically introduce a small amount of variability to timers to make them less useful for identifying the user's system.

Note:
See Fingerprinting on web.dev for additional useful information.
Privacy features provided by browsersBrowser vendors are aware of the need to protect user privacy and the negative effects of tracking, fingerprinting, etc., on user experience. To this end, they have implemented various features that enhance privacy protection and/or mitigate threats. In this section, we look at different categories of privacy protection that browsers apply automatically.HTTPS by defaultTransport Layer Security (TLS) provides security and privacy by encrypting data during transport over the network and is the technology behind the HTTPS protocol. TLS is good for privacy because it stops third parties from being able to intercept transmitted data and use it maliciously, for example for tracking.
All browsers are moving towards requiring HTTPS by default; this is practically the case already because you can't do much on the web without this protocol.
Related topics are as follows:

Certificate Transparency

An open standard for monitoring and auditing certificates, creating a database of public logs that can be used to help identify incorrect or malicious certificates.

HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)

HSTS is used by servers to let them protect themselves from protocol downgrade and cookie hijack attacks by letting sites tell clients that they can only use HTTPS to communicate with the server.

HTTP/2

While HTTP/2 technically does not have to use encryption, most browser developers support it only when used with HTTPS; so in that regard, it can be thought of as a feature to enhance security/privacy.

Opt-in for "powerful features"So-called "powerful" web API features that provide access to potentially sensitive data and operations are available only in secure contexts, which basically means HTTPS-only. Not only that, but these web features are gated behind a system of user permissions. Users have to explicitly opt in to features like allowing notifications, accessing geolocation data, making the browser go into fullscreen mode, accessing media streams from webcams, using web payments, etc.Anti-tracking technologyBrowsers have implemented several anti-tracking features that automatically enhance their users' privacy protection. Many of these block or limit the ability of third-party sites embedded in <iframe>s to access cookies set on the top-level domain, run tracking scripts, etc.

The Set-Cookie header SameSite attribute's default value has been updated to Lax, to provide better protection against tracking and CSRF attacks. See Controlling third-party cookies with SameSite for more information.
Browsers have all started to block third-party cookies by default. See How do browsers handle third-party cookies? for more details.
Browsers are implementing technologies to allow third-party cookies only in certain circumstances that do not damage privacy, or to implement common use cases that currently require third-party cookies in alternative ways. See Transitioning from third-party cookies and Replacing third-party cookies.
Several browsers strip out known tracking parameters from URLs — this includes Firefox, Safari, and Brave. Browser extensions also help to do this, for example ClearURLs.
Browsers have implemented redirect tracking protection.
Privacy considerations for client-side developersThere are several actions web developers can and should take to improve privacy for their users. The below sections discuss the most important ones. Some of the categories are not purely technical tasks as such and will involve collaboration with other team members.Collect data ethicallyCompanies collect lots of different data from their users for a variety of different reasons:

Usernames, passwords, emails, etc. for authentication purposes.
Emails, postal addresses, and phone numbers for communication.
Age, gender, geographical location, favorite pastimes, and a host of other PII for anything from site personalization to customer satisfaction surveys.
Browsing habits on their sites and other sites, to measure page and feature success metrics.
And so much more.

When collecting data from your customers, you have an opportunity to behave with integrity, show them that you are trustworthy, and build a great relationship with them, in turn, improving your brand and your chance of success.
The ethics of data collection can be broken down into three simple principles:

Don't collect more data than you need
Communicate clearly how you are going to use the data you collect
Delete the data once you have finished with it


Note:
The tips provided below make for a better, more privacy-aware user experience, but many of them are required by law to comply with regulations, for example the GDPR in the EU. You should make sure to find out what regulations apply to you in your locale, and what you need to do to comply with them.
Don't collect more data than you needIt is tempting to ask for a lot of data from your users because you think it might be useful in the future. However, every bit of extra data you collect adds risk to your users' privacy and increases the chance that they will abandon the step they are performing (whether it is filling out a survey or signing up for a service).
It is good to anonymize data. You should also consider whether you can get what you need by making your data request less granular. As an example, instead of asking a user their favorite products, you could ask them to select between more general categories.
The best way to protect user privacy though, is to minimize the data you collect. Referring to the previous example, you could infer the same data by looking at user purchase history. As another example, users appreciate being able to buy products anonymously. You shouldn't force them to sign up for an account; if it's not necessary for the service to operate, it should be their choice.Communicate clearly how you are going to use the data you collectOnce you have decided what data you are going to collect, you should publish a privacy policy on your site that clearly states:

Data that you collect
Ways in which you use the data
Parties with whom you tend to share the data, if at all, and a declaration that you will ask for user consent before sharing
The duration for which you keep the data before it is deleted
Ways in which users can view the data you have collected from them and delete it if they want to

When providing you with data, your users should be given an opportunity to read your privacy policy, and consent to it. They should be able to control if they are happy with this and agree to your terms. And as indicated above, they should also get to see what data of theirs you have collected, and delete it if they want to.
When you've published your privacy policy, you need to make sure that you comply with it — doing what you say you are going to do is very important in building user trust. You should only collect the data you say you'll collect, and only use it for the purpose you say you'll use it for. If someone from your company comes up with a clever new way to use existing data, that still isn't OK under the terms of your policy if it doesn't specify that you'll use it for that purpose. If users consented to the use of their data for a specific purpose and that purpose expands, you may have to consider obtaining new consent.Delete the data once you have finished with itEarlier on, we mentioned giving users a way to see what data of theirs you have collected, and delete it if they want to. You could possibly do this as part of the same experience they can use to delete their account (their data goes with it), or make them two separate options. Either way, the options should be easy to find.
Allowing the user to choose when significant portions of data get deleted is very empowering, and builds trust, but there may be some bits of data that you will want to handle deletion of yourself. For example, some data might only be used for a few hours or minutes and then deleted, like data that is used during the administration of a user's session while they are logged in.

Note:
The Clear-Site-Data HTTP response header is very useful for clearing short-lived user data — it instructs the browser to clear out its cache and/or cookies and/or storage (e.g., Web Storage or IndexedDB data). For example, you might get your server to send it along with a "logged out confirmation" page so that once the user is logged out, their data is safely removed.
Cut down on trackingEarlier on we discussed tracking, and some of the unethical purposes it is used for. We shouldn't have to spell out how such uses can erode user trust; wherever possible, you should only use potential tracking mechanisms like third-party cookies for ethical uses, such as transferring sign-in or other personalization status across sites.
Also recall from earlier that browsers are all starting to block third-party cookies by default, while implementing alternative technologies to achieve common use case. It is a good idea to prepare for this, by limiting the amount of tracking activities you rely on, and/or implementing desired information persistence in other ways. See Transitioning from third-party cookies for more information.Carefully manage third-party resourcesOf course, it would be easy to manage privacy if you were only worried about resources you have created (code, cookies, sites, etc.). The real challenge comes from the fact that your site will likely use third-party resources. This can include third-party content embedded in <iframe>s, libraries, frameworks, APIs, externally-hosted resources such as images and videos, etc.
Third-party resources are an essential part of modern web development, they provide a lot of power. However, any third-party resource you allow onto your site potentially has the same permissions as your own resources; it all depends on how it is included on your site:

JavaScript running inside third-party content embedded in your site via an <iframe> is separated by same-origin policy, meaning that it wouldn't have access to other scripts and data included in the top-level browsing context.
However, a third-party script included directly in your page via a <script> element would have access to your other scripts and data, whether it was hosted on your site or another site. It would effectively be first-party code. A malicious script included in this way could secretly steal your users' data, for example sending it off to a third-party server.

It is important to audit all of the third-party resources you use on your site. Make sure you know what data they collect, what requests they make and to whom, and what their privacy policies are. Your carefully designed privacy policy is useless if you use a third-party script that violates it.

Note:
There are various tools out there that can help you build up a picture of what requests a site is making, for example the Request Map Generator.

Once you have audited your third-party resources and understand what they are doing, you should then consider their negatives as a trade-off for the value they bring. If a third-party script is free and really useful but collects quite a lot of user data, you could:

Accept that trade-off, update your privacy policy to include details of it, and hope that it doesn't impact your users' trust too much.
Look for an alternative, less data-hungry third-party tool.
Build your own tool.

The following list provides some tips on how to mitigate privacy risks inherent with using third-party resources:


When embedding third-party resources, consider if there is a way to achieve the same or a similar effect with less privacy impact. For example, it might be fun to have a social media post viewer embedded on your site, but is it really necessary? Wouldn't a link to your social media page be sufficient? Also, some third-party services have privacy-enhancing options. See, for example, YouTube's Embed videos & playlists > Turn on privacy-enhanced mode.


Where possible, you should block third parties from receiving a Referer header when you make requests to them. This can be done in a pretty granular way, for example by including rel="noreferrer" on external links. Or, you could set this more globally for the page or site, for example by using the Referrer-Policy header.

Note:
See also Referer header: privacy and security concerns.



Use the Permissions-Policy HTTP header to control access to API "powerful features" (such as notifications, geolocation data, accessing media streams from webcams, etc.). This can be useful for privacy because it stops third-party sites from doing unexpected things with these features, and users don't want to be unnecessarily bombarded by permission prompts that they may not understand. You can also control usage of "powerful features" inside third-party sites embedded inside <iframe> elements by specifying permissions policies inside an allow attribute on the <iframe> itself.

Note:
See also our Permissions-Policy guide for more information and examples, and permissionspolicy.com for useful tools including a policy generator.



Use the <iframe> sandbox attribute to allow or disallow usage of certain features inside the content embedded in the <iframe> — this includes things like downloads, form submissions, modals, and scripting.



Note:
See Third parties over on web.dev for additional useful information on auditing and more.
Protect user dataYou need to make sure that user data is transmitted and stored securely once you've collected it. This is more of a security topic, but it is worth mentioning here — a good privacy policy is useless if your security is lax and attackers can steal the data from you.
The below tips offer some guidance on protecting your user's data:

Security is hard to get right. When implementing a secure solution that involves data collection — particularly if it is sensitive data such as sign-in credentials — it makes sense to use a reputable solution from a well-respected provider. For example, any respectable server-side framework will have built-in features to protect against common vulnerabilities. You could also consider using a specialized product for your purpose — for example an identity provider solution, or a secure online survey provider.
If you want to roll out your own solution for collecting user data, make sure you understand what you are doing. Hire an experienced server-side developer and/or security engineer to implement the system, and ensure it is tested thoroughly. Use multifactor authentication (MFA) to provide better protection. Consider using a dedicated API such as Web Authentication or Federated Credential Management to streamline the client-side of the app.
When collecting user sign-up information, enforce strong passwords so your user's account details cannot be easily guessed. Weak passwords are one of the main causes of security breaches. Encourage your users to use a password manager to generate and store complex passwords; this way they won't worry about remembering them, or create a security risk by writing them down.
Don't include sensitive data in URLs — if a third party intercepts the URL (for example via the Referer header), they could steal that information. Use POST requests rather than GET requests to avoid this.
Consider using tools like Content Security Policy and Permissions Policy to enforce a set of feature usage on your site that makes it harder to introduce vulnerabilities. Be careful when doing this — if you block usage of a feature that a third-party script relies on to work, you may end up breaking your site's functionality. This is something you can look into when auditing your third-party resources (see Carefully manage third-party resources).

Like a website, a PWA can run on multiple platforms and devices from a single codebase. Like a platform-specific app, it can be installed on the device, can operate while offline and in the background, and can integrate with the device and with other installed apps.GuidesThese guides give conceptual explanations of different aspects of PWAs. They're intended to help you understand what kinds of things are possible with PWAs, and to provide enough pointers to help you understand how to achieve them.

What is a progressive web app?

An introduction to PWAs, comparing them with traditional websites and with platform-specific apps, and outlining their main features.

Making PWAs installable

One of the defining aspects of a PWA is that it can be installed on the device, and then appears to users as a platform-specific app, a permanent feature of their device which they can launch directly from the operating system like any other app. In this guide we'll explore what "installable" means, what a PWA needs to provide for it to be installable, and how you can customize the install experience.

Installing and uninstalling web apps

This guide covers how users can install and uninstall PWAs on their devices.

Offline and background operation

In this guide, we'll introduce a set of technologies that enable a PWA to provide a good user experience even when the device has intermittent network connectivity and to perform operations in the background, even when the main app is not running.

Caching

An overview of the APIs that enable a PWA to cache resources locally, and some common strategies used by PWAs to implement offline functionality.

Best practices for PWAs

PWAs should adapt to different browsers and devices, be accessible, have good performance, and integrate well with the operating system. This guide provides a list of best practices to help you make sure your PWA is as good as it can be.

How toThese guides give concrete detailed instructions for how to implement specific PWA features.

Create a standalone app

Describes how to specify that a PWA should be launched in its own dedicated window when it is launched, rather than a browser tab.

Define your app icons

Describes how to define your own set of icons to be used when the PWA is installed on a device.

Customize your app's colors

Describes how to set background and theme colors for a PWA.

Display badges

Describes how to display a badge on the PWA's icon: for example to let the user know that they have received new messages.

Expose common app actions as shortcuts

Describes how to expose common actions for a PWA that can be launched from the operating system's app shortcut menu.

Share data between apps

Describes how PWAs can share data with each other by using the operating system's app sharing mechanism.

Trigger installation from your PWA

Describes how developers can provide their own UI to invite users to install their PWA.

Associate files with your PWA

Describes how you can create an association between file types and your PWA, so that when the user clicks on the file, your PWA is launched to handle it.

TutorialsIn these tutorials, you'll build a PWA from scratch. Tutorials walk through the steps of creating an app, from start to finish, explaining how the different features of the app are implemented.

Creating your first PWA

This novice-level tutorial walks through the creation of a PWA to track menstrual cycles. Lessons include a walk through of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript required to create a fully functional web app, setting up a testing environment, and complete explanations guiding the learner through upgrading the web app into a PWA; including developing and inspecting a manifest, adding a service worker, and using the service worker to delete stale caches.

Deep dive into PWA

This intermediate-level tutorial walks through the creation of a PWA that lists information about games submitted to the A-Frame category in the js13kGames 2017 competition. This tutorial includes all the basics for creating a PWA, with additional features, including notifications, push, and app performance.

ReferenceReference documentation for the web technologies you will use to build a PWA.Web app manifest
Web app manifest members

Developers can use web app manifest members to describe a PWA, customize its appearance, and more deeply integrate it into the operating system.

Service Worker APIsCommunication with the app
The following APIs can be used by a service worker to communicate with its associated client PWA:

Client.postMessage()

Allows a service worker to send a message to its client PWA.

Broadcast Channel API

Allows a service worker and its client PWA to establish a basic two-way communication channel.


Offline operation
The following APIs can be used by a service worker to make your app work offline:

Cache

A persistent storage mechanism for HTTP responses used to store assets that can be reused when the app is offline.

Clients

An interface used to provide access to the documents that are controlled by the service worker.

FetchEvent

An event, dispatched in the service worker with every HTTP request made by the client PWA. The event can be used to either send the request to the server as normal and save the response for future use, or intercept the request and immediately respond with a response cached previously.


Background operation
The following APIs can be used by a service worker to perform tasks in the background, even when your app is not running:

Background Synchronization API

A way to defer tasks to run in a service worker once there is a stable network connection.

Web Periodic Background Synchronization API

A way to register tasks to be run in a service worker at periodic intervals with network connectivity.

Background Fetch API

A method for a service worker to manage downloads that may take a significant amount of time, such as video or audio files.

Other web APIs
IndexedDB

A client-side storage API for significant amounts of structured data, including files.

Badging API

A method of setting a badge on the application icon, providing a low-distraction notification.

Notifications API

A way to send notifications that are displayed at the operating system level.

Web Share API

A mechanism for sharing text, links, files, and other content to other apps selected by the user on their device.

Window Controls Overlay API

An API for PWAs installed on desktop operating systems that enables hiding the default window title bar, enabling displaying the app over the full surface area of the app window.

Like a website, a PWA can run on multiple platforms and devices from a single codebase. Like a platform-specific app, it can be installed on the device, can operate while offline and in the background, and can integrate with the device and with other installed apps.GuidesThese guides give conceptual explanations of different aspects of PWAs. They're intended to help you understand what kinds of things are possible with PWAs, and to provide enough pointers to help you understand how to achieve them.

What is a progressive web app?

An introduction to PWAs, comparing them with traditional websites and with platform-specific apps, and outlining their main features.

Making PWAs installable

One of the defining aspects of a PWA is that it can be installed on the device, and then appears to users as a platform-specific app, a permanent feature of their device which they can launch directly from the operating system like any other app. In this guide we'll explore what "installable" means, what a PWA needs to provide for it to be installable, and how you can customize the install experience.

Installing and uninstalling web apps

This guide covers how users can install and uninstall PWAs on their devices.

Offline and background operation

In this guide, we'll introduce a set of technologies that enable a PWA to provide a good user experience even when the device has intermittent network connectivity and to perform operations in the background, even when the main app is not running.

Caching

An overview of the APIs that enable a PWA to cache resources locally, and some common strategies used by PWAs to implement offline functionality.

Best practices for PWAs

PWAs should adapt to different browsers and devices, be accessible, have good performance, and integrate well with the operating system. This guide provides a list of best practices to help you make sure your PWA is as good as it can be.

How toThese guides give concrete detailed instructions for how to implement specific PWA features.

Create a standalone app

Describes how to specify that a PWA should be launched in its own dedicated window when it is launched, rather than a browser tab.

Define your app icons

Describes how to define your own set of icons to be used when the PWA is installed on a device.

Customize your app's colors

Describes how to set background and theme colors for a PWA.

Display badges

Describes how to display a badge on the PWA's icon: for example to let the user know that they have received new messages.

Expose common app actions as shortcuts

Describes how to expose common actions for a PWA that can be launched from the operating system's app shortcut menu.

Share data between apps

Describes how PWAs can share data with each other by using the operating system's app sharing mechanism.

Trigger installation from your PWA

Describes how developers can provide their own UI to invite users to install their PWA.

Associate files with your PWA

Describes how you can create an association between file types and your PWA, so that when the user clicks on the file, your PWA is launched to handle it.

Some of it is non-sensitive, for example the copy shown on the public pages. Some of it is sensitive, for example customer usernames, passwords, and banking information, or internal algorithms and private product information.
Sensitive information needs to be protected, and that is the focus of web security. If that information fell into the wrong hands, it could be used to:

Put companies at a competitive disadvantage by sharing their information with competitors.
Disable or hijack their services, again causing serious problems with their operation.
Put their customer's privacy at risk, making them vulnerable to profiling, targeting, loss of data, identity theft, or even financial loss.

Modern browsers already have several features to protect users' security on the web, but developers also need to use best practices and code carefully to ensure that their websites are secure. Even simple bugs in your code can result in vulnerabilities that bad actors can exploit to steal data and gain unauthorized control over services.
This article provides an introduction to web security, including conceptual information to help you understand website vulnerabilities and practical guides on how to secure them.Relationship between security and privacySecurity and privacy are distinct yet closely related topics. It is worth knowing the differences between the two and how they relate.


Security is the act of keeping private data and systems protected against unauthorized access. This includes both company (internal) data and user and partner (external) data.


Privacy refers to the act of giving users control over how their data is collected, stored, and used, while also ensuring that it is not used irresponsibly. For example, you should let your users know what data you are collecting from them, the parties with whom it will be shared, and how it will be used. Users must be given a chance to consent to your privacy policy, have access to their data you store, and delete it if they choose to.


Good security is essential for good privacy. You could follow all the advice listed in our Privacy on the web guide, but acting with integrity and having a robust privacy policy are futile if your site is not secure and attackers can just steal data anyway.Security features provided by browsersWeb browsers follow a strict security model that enforces strong security for content, connections between the browser and the server, and data transportation. This section looks at the features that underpin this model.Same-origin policy and CORSSame-origin policy is a fundamental security mechanism of the web that restricts how a document or a script loaded from one origin can interact with a resource from another origin. It helps isolate potentially malicious documents, reducing possible attack vectors.
In general, documents from one origin cannot make requests to other origins. This makes sense because you don't want sites to be able to interfere with one another and access unauthorized data.
However, you might want to relax this restriction in some circumstances; for example, if you have multiple websites that interact with each other, you may allow them to request resources from one another using fetch(). This can be permitted using Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), an HTTP-header-based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should permit loading resources.HTTP model for communicationThe HTTP protocol is used by web browsers and servers to communicate with one another, request resources, provide responses (for example, providing a requested resource or detailing why a request failed), and provide security features for that communication.
Transport Layer Security (TLS) provides security and privacy by encrypting data during transport over the network and is the technology behind the HTTPS protocol. TLS is good for privacy because it stops third parties from being able to intercept transmitted data and use it maliciously.
All browsers are moving towards requiring HTTPS by default; this is practically the case already because you can't do much on the web without this protocol.
Related topics:

Transport layer security (TLS)

The TLS protocol is the standard for enabling two networked applications or devices to exchange information privately and robustly. Applications that use TLS can choose their security parameters, which can have a substantial impact on the security and reliability of data.

HTTP Strict-Transport-Security

The Strict-Transport-Security HTTP header lets a website specify that it may only be accessed using HTTPS.

Certificate Transparency

Certificate Transparency (CT) is an open framework designed to protect against and monitor for certificate misissuance. Newly issued certificates are 'logged' to publicly run, often independent CT logs. These provide append-only, cryptographically assured records of issued TLS certificates.

Mixed content

An HTTPS page that includes content fetched using cleartext HTTP is called a mixed content page. Pages like this are only partially encrypted, leaving the unencrypted content accessible to sniffers and man-in-the-middle attackers.

Weak signature algorithms

The strength of the hash algorithm used in signing a digital certificate is a critical element of the security of the certificate. Some signature algorithms are known to be weak, and should be avoided when appropriate.

Secure contexts and feature permissionsBrowsers control the usage of "powerful features" in different ways. These "powerful features" include generating system notifications on a website, using a user's webcam to get access to a media stream, manipulating the system GPU, and using web payments. If a site could just use the APIs that control such features without restriction, malicious developers could attempt to do the following:

Annoy users with unneeded notifications and other UI features.
Turn their webcam on without warning to spy on them.
Clog up their browser/system to create Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
Steal data or money.

These "powerful features" are controlled in the following ways:


Usage of such features is permitted only in secure contexts. A secure context is a window or a worker for which there is reasonable confidence that the content has been delivered securely (via HTTPS/TLS). In a secure context, the potential for communication with contexts that are not secure is limited. Secure contexts also help to prevent man-in-the-middle attackers from accessing powerful features.
To see a list of web platform features available only in secure contexts, see Features restricted to secure contexts.


The usage of these features is gated behind a system of user permissions: users have to explicitly opt-in to providing access to such features, meaning that they can't be used automatically. User permission requests happen automatically, and you can query the state of an API permission by using the Permissions API.


Several other browser features can be used only in response to a user action such as clicking a button, meaning that they need to be invoked from inside an appropriate event handler. This is called transient activation. See Features gated by user activation for more information.

High-level security considerationsThere are many aspects of web security that need to be thought about on the server- and client-side. This section focuses mainly on client-side security considerations. You can find a useful summary of security from a server-side perspective, which also includes descriptions of common attacks to watch out for, at Website security (part of our Server-side website programming learning module).Store client-side data responsiblyHandling data responsibly is largely concerned with cutting down on third-party cookie usage and being careful about the data you store and share with them. Traditionally, web developers have used cookies to store all kinds of data, and it has been easy for attackers to exploit this tendency. As a result, browsers have started to limit what you can do with cross-site cookies, with the aim of removing access to them altogether in the future.
You should prepare for the removal of cross-site cookies by limiting the amount of tracking activities you rely on and/or by implementing the persistence of the desired information in other ways. See Transitioning from third-party cookies and Replacing third-party cookies for more information.Protect user identity and manage loginsWhen implementing a secure solution that involves data collection, particularly if the data is sensitive such as log-in credentials, it makes sense to use a reputable solution. For example, any respectable server-side framework will have built-in features to protect against common vulnerabilities. You could also consider using a specialized product for your purpose, for example an identity provider solution or a secure online survey provider.
If you want to roll your own solution for collecting user data, make sure you understand all aspects and requirements. Hire an experienced server-side developer and/or security engineer to implement the system, and ensure it is tested thoroughly. Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to provide better protection. Consider using a dedicated API such as Web Authentication or Federated Credential Management to streamline the client-side of the app.
Here are some other tips for providing secure logins:


When collecting user login information, enforce strong passwords so that your user's account details cannot be easily guessed. Weak passwords are one of the main causes of security breaches. In addition, encourage your users to use a password manager so that they can use more complex passwords, don't need to worry about remembering them, and won't create a security risk by writing them down. See also our article on Insecure passwords.


You should also educate your users about phishing. Phishing is the act of sending a message to a user (for example, an email or an SMS) containing a link to a site that looks like a site they use every day but isn't. The link is accompanied by a message designed to trick users into entering their username and password on the site so it can be stolen and then used by an attacker for malicious purposes.

Note:
Some phishing sites can be very sophisticated and hard to distinguish from a real website. You should therefore educate your users to not trust random links in emails and SMS messages. If they receive a message along the lines of "Urgent, you need to log in now to resolve an issue", they should go to the site directly in a new tab and try logging in directly rather than clicking the link in the message. Or they could phone or email you to discuss the message they received.



Protect against brute force attacks on login pages with rate limiting, account lockouts after a certain number of unsuccessful attempts, and CAPTCHA challenges.


Manage user login sessions with unique session IDs, and automatically log out users after periods of inactivity.

Don't include sensitive data in URL query stringsAs a general rule, you shouldn't include sensitive data in URL query strings because if a third party intercepts the URL (for example, via the Referer HTTP header), they could steal that information. Even more serious is the fact that these URLs can be indexed by public web crawlers, HTTP proxies, and archiving tools such as the internet archive, meaning that your sensitive data could persist on publicly accessible resources.
Use POST requests rather than GET requests to avoid these issues. Our article Referer header policy: Privacy and security concerns describes in more detail the privacy and security risks associated with the Referer header, and offers advice on mitigating those risks.

Note:
Steering away from transmitting sensitive data in URLs via GET requests can also help protect against cross-site request forgery and replay attacks.
Enforce usage policiesConsider using web platform features like Content Security Policy (CSP) and Permissions Policy to enforce a set of feature and resource usage rules on your website that make it harder to introduce vulnerabilities.
CSP allows you to add a layer of security by, for example, allowing images or scripts to be loaded only from specific trusted origins. This helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. These attacks involve a range of malicious activities, including data theft, site defacement, and distribution of malware.
Permissions policy works in a similar way, except that it is more concerned with allowing or blocking access to specific "powerful features" (as mentioned earlier).

Note:
Such policies are very useful to help keep sites secure, especially when you are using a lot of third-party code on your site. However, keep in mind that if you block usage of a feature that a third-party script relies on to work, you may end up breaking your site's functionality.
Maintain data integrityFollowing on from the previous section, when you allow feature and resource usage on your site, you should try to ensure that resources have not been tampered with.
Related topics:

Subresource integrity

Subresource Integrity (SRI) is a security feature that enables browsers to verify that resources they fetch (for example, from a CDN) are delivered without unexpected manipulation. It works by allowing you to provide a cryptographic hash that a fetched resource must match.

HTTP Access-Control-Allow-Origin

The Access-Control-Allow-Origin response header indicates whether the response can be shared with requesting code from the given origin.

HTTP X-Content-Type-Options

The X-Content-Type-Options response header is a marker used by the server to indicate that the MIME types advertised in the Content-Type headers should not be changed and must be followed. This header is a way to opt out of MIME type sniffing, or, in other words, to specify that the MIME types are deliberately configured.

Sanitize form inputAs a general rule, don't trust anything that users enter into forms. Filling out forms online is complicated and tedious, and it is easy for users to enter incorrect data or data in the wrong format. In addition, malicious folks are skilled in the art of entering specific strings of executable code into form fields (for example, SQL or JavaScript). If you're not careful about handling such inputs, they could either execute harmful code on your site or delete your databases. See SQL injection for a good example of how this could happen.
To protect against this, you should thoroughly sanitize data entered into your forms:

You should implement client-side validation to inform users when they have entered data in the wrong format. You can do this using built-in HTML form validation features, or you can write your own validation code. See Client-side form validation for more information.
You should use output encoding when displaying user input in an application UI to safely display data exactly as a user typed it in and avoid it being executed as code. See Output encoding for more information.

You can't rely on client-side validation alone for security — it should be combined with server-side validation. Client-side validation enhances the user experience by providing instant validation feedback without having to wait for a round trip to the server. However, client-side validation is easy for a malicious party to bypass (for example, by turning off JavaScript in the browser to bypass JavaScript-based validation).
Any reputable server-side framework will provide functionality for validating form submissions. In addition, a common best practice is to escape any special characters that form part of executable syntax, thereby making any entered code no longer executable and treated as plain text.Protect against clickjackingIn a clickjacking attack, a user is fooled into clicking a UI element that performs an action different from what the user expects, often resulting in the user's confidential information being passed to a malicious third party. This risk is inherent in embedded third-party content, so make sure you trust what is being embedded into your site. Additionally, be aware that clickjacking can be combined with phishing techniques. You can read about phishing in the previous section Protect user identity and manage logins.
The following features can help guard against clickjacking:

HTTP X-Frame-Options

The X-Frame-Options HTTP response header can be used to indicate whether a browser should be allowed to render a page in a <frame>, <iframe>, <embed> or <object>. Sites can use this to avoid clickjacking attacks, by ensuring that their content is not embedded into other sites.

CSP: frame-ancestors

The HTTP Content-Security-Policy (CSP) frame-ancestors directive specifies valid parents that may embed a page using <frame>, <iframe>, <object>, or <embed>.

Practical security implementation guidesTo get comprehensive instructions for implementing security features effectively on websites and to ensure you're following best practices, see our set of Practical security implementation guides.
Some of these guides are directly related to the HTTP Observatory tool. Observatory performs security audits on a website and provides a grade and score along with recommendations for fixing the security issues it finds. These guides explain how to resolve issues surfaced by the MDN Observatory tests: the tool links to the relevant guide for each issue, helping guide you towards an effective resolution. Interestingly, Mozilla's internal developer teams use this guidance when implementing websites to ensure that security best practices are applied.See also

This section looks at the features that underpin this model.Same-origin policy and CORSSame-origin policy is a fundamental security mechanism of the web that restricts how a document or a script loaded from one origin can interact with a resource from another origin. It helps isolate potentially malicious documents, reducing possible attack vectors.
In general, documents from one origin cannot make requests to other origins. This makes sense because you don't want sites to be able to interfere with one another and access unauthorized data.
However, you might want to relax this restriction in some circumstances; for example, if you have multiple websites that interact with each other, you may allow them to request resources from one another using fetch(). This can be permitted using Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), an HTTP-header-based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should permit loading resources.HTTP model for communicationThe HTTP protocol is used by web browsers and servers to communicate with one another, request resources, provide responses (for example, providing a requested resource or detailing why a request failed), and provide security features for that communication.
Transport Layer Security (TLS) provides security and privacy by encrypting data during transport over the network and is the technology behind the HTTPS protocol. TLS is good for privacy because it stops third parties from being able to intercept transmitted data and use it maliciously.
All browsers are moving towards requiring HTTPS by default; this is practically the case already because you can't do much on the web without this protocol.

Transport layer security (TLS)

The TLS protocol is the standard for enabling two networked applications or devices to exchange information privately and robustly. Applications that use TLS can choose their security parameters, which can have a substantial impact on the security and reliability of data.

HTTP Strict-Transport-Security

The Strict-Transport-Security HTTP header lets a website specify that it may only be accessed using HTTPS.

Certificate Transparency

Certificate Transparency (CT) is an open framework designed to protect against and monitor for certificate misissuance. Newly issued certificates are 'logged' to publicly run, often independent CT logs. These provide append-only, cryptographically assured records of issued TLS certificates.

Mixed content

An HTTPS page that includes content fetched using cleartext HTTP is called a mixed content page. Pages like this are only partially encrypted, leaving the unencrypted content accessible to sniffers and man-in-the-middle attackers.

Weak signature algorithms

The strength of the hash algorithm used in signing a digital certificate is a critical element of the security of the certificate. Some signature algorithms are known to be weak, and should be avoided when appropriate.

Secure contexts and feature permissionsBrowsers control the usage of "powerful features" in different ways. These "powerful features" include generating system notifications on a website, using a user's webcam to get access to a media stream, manipulating the system GPU, and using web payments. If a site could just use the APIs that control such features without restriction, malicious developers could attempt to do the following:

Annoy users with unneeded notifications and other UI features.
Turn their webcam on without warning to spy on them.
Clog up their browser/system to create Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
Steal data or money.

These "powerful features" are controlled in the following ways:


Usage of such features is permitted only in secure contexts. A secure context is a window or a worker for which there is reasonable confidence that the content has been delivered securely (via HTTPS/TLS). In a secure context, the potential for communication with contexts that are not secure is limited. Secure contexts also help to prevent man-in-the-middle attackers from accessing powerful features.
To see a list of web platform features available only in secure contexts, see Features restricted to secure contexts.


The usage of these features is gated behind a system of user permissions: users have to explicitly opt-in to providing access to such features, meaning that they can't be used automatically. User permission requests happen automatically, and you can query the state of an API permission by using the Permissions API.


Several other browser features can be used only in response to a user action such as clicking a button, meaning that they need to be invoked from inside an appropriate event handler. This is called transient activation. See Features gated by user activation for more information.

High-level security considerationsThere are many aspects of web security that need to be thought about on the server- and client-side. This section focuses mainly on client-side security considerations. You can find a useful summary of security from a server-side perspective, which also includes descriptions of common attacks to watch out for, at Website security (part of our Server-side website programming learning module).Store client-side data responsiblyHandling data responsibly is largely concerned with cutting down on third-party cookie usage and being careful about the data you store and share with them. Traditionally, web developers have used cookies to store all kinds of data, and it has been easy for attackers to exploit this tendency. As a result, browsers have started to limit what you can do with cross-site cookies, with the aim of removing access to them altogether in the future.
You should prepare for the removal of cross-site cookies by limiting the amount of tracking activities you rely on and/or by implementing the persistence of the desired information in other ways. See Transitioning from third-party cookies and Replacing third-party cookies for more information.Protect user identity and manage loginsWhen implementing a secure solution that involves data collection, particularly if the data is sensitive such as log-in credentials, it makes sense to use a reputable solution. For example, any respectable server-side framework will have built-in features to protect against common vulnerabilities. You could also consider using a specialized product for your purpose, for example an identity provider solution or a secure online survey provider.
If you want to roll your own solution for collecting user data, make sure you understand all aspects and requirements. Hire an experienced server-side developer and/or security engineer to implement the system, and ensure it is tested thoroughly. Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to provide better protection. Consider using a dedicated API such as Web Authentication or Federated Credential Management to streamline the client-side of the app.
Here are some other tips for providing secure logins:


When collecting user login information, enforce strong passwords so that your user's account details cannot be easily guessed. Weak passwords are one of the main causes of security breaches. In addition, encourage your users to use a password manager so that they can use more complex passwords, don't need to worry about remembering them, and won't create a security risk by writing them down. See also our article on Insecure passwords.


You should also educate your users about phishing. Phishing is the act of sending a message to a user (for example, an email or an SMS) containing a link to a site that looks like a site they use every day but isn't. The link is accompanied by a message designed to trick users into entering their username and password on the site so it can be stolen and then used by an attacker for malicious purposes.

Note:
Some phishing sites can be very sophisticated and hard to distinguish from a real website. You should therefore educate your users to not trust random links in emails and SMS messages. If they receive a message along the lines of "Urgent, you need to log in now to resolve an issue", they should go to the site directly in a new tab and try logging in directly rather than clicking the link in the message. Or they could phone or email you to discuss the message they received.



Protect against brute force attacks on login pages with rate limiting, account lockouts after a certain number of unsuccessful attempts, and CAPTCHA challenges.


Manage user login sessions with unique session IDs, and automatically log out users after periods of inactivity.

Don't include sensitive data in URL query stringsAs a general rule, you shouldn't include sensitive data in URL query strings because if a third party intercepts the URL (for example, via the Referer HTTP header), they could steal that information. Even more serious is the fact that these URLs can be indexed by public web crawlers, HTTP proxies, and archiving tools such as the internet archive, meaning that your sensitive data could persist on publicly accessible resources.
Use POST requests rather than GET requests to avoid these issues. Our article Referer header policy: Privacy and security concerns describes in more detail the privacy and security risks associated with the Referer header, and offers advice on mitigating those risks.

Note:
Steering away from transmitting sensitive data in URLs via GET requests can also help protect against cross-site request forgery and replay attacks.
Enforce usage policiesConsider using web platform features like Content Security Policy (CSP) and Permissions Policy to enforce a set of feature and resource usage rules on your website that make it harder to introduce vulnerabilities.
CSP allows you to add a layer of security by, for example, allowing images or scripts to be loaded only from specific trusted origins. This helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. These attacks involve a range of malicious activities, including data theft, site defacement, and distribution of malware.
Permissions policy works in a similar way, except that it is more concerned with allowing or blocking access to specific "powerful features" (as mentioned earlier).

Note:
Such policies are very useful to help keep sites secure, especially when you are using a lot of third-party code on your site. However, keep in mind that if you block usage of a feature that a third-party script relies on to work, you may end up breaking your site's functionality.
Maintain data integrityFollowing on from the previous section, when you allow feature and resource usage on your site, you should try to ensure that resources have not been tampered with.
Related topics:

Subresource integrity

Subresource Integrity (SRI) is a security feature that enables browsers to verify that resources they fetch (for example, from a CDN) are delivered without unexpected manipulation. It works by allowing you to provide a cryptographic hash that a fetched resource must match.

HTTP Access-Control-Allow-Origin

The Access-Control-Allow-Origin response header indicates whether the response can be shared with requesting code from the given origin.

HTTP X-Content-Type-Options

The X-Content-Type-Options response header is a marker used by the server to indicate that the MIME types advertised in the Content-Type headers should not be changed and must be followed. This header is a way to opt out of MIME type sniffing, or, in other words, to specify that the MIME types are deliberately configured.

Sanitize form inputAs a general rule, don't trust anything that users enter into forms. Filling out forms online is complicated and tedious, and it is easy for users to enter incorrect data or data in the wrong format. In addition, malicious folks are skilled in the art of entering specific strings of executable code into form fields (for example, SQL or JavaScript). If you're not careful about handling such inputs, they could either execute harmful code on your site or delete your databases. See SQL injection for a good example of how this could happen.
To protect against this, you should thoroughly sanitize data entered into your forms:

You should implement client-side validation to inform users when they have entered data in the wrong format. You can do this using built-in HTML form validation features, or you can write your own validation code. See Client-side form validation for more information.
You should use output encoding when displaying user input in an application UI to safely display data exactly as a user typed it in and avoid it being executed as code. See Output encoding for more information.

You can't rely on client-side validation alone for security — it should be combined with server-side validation. Client-side validation enhances the user experience by providing instant validation feedback without having to wait for a round trip to the server. However, client-side validation is easy for a malicious party to bypass (for example, by turning off JavaScript in the browser to bypass JavaScript-based validation).
Any reputable server-side framework will provide functionality for validating form submissions. In addition, a common best practice is to escape any special characters that form part of executable syntax, thereby making any entered code no longer executable and treated as plain text.Protect against clickjackingIn a clickjacking attack, a user is fooled into clicking a UI element that performs an action different from what the user expects, often resulting in the user's confidential information being passed to a malicious third party. This risk is inherent in embedded third-party content, so make sure you trust what is being embedded into your site. Additionally, be aware that clickjacking can be combined with phishing techniques. You can read about phishing in the previous section Protect user identity and manage logins.
The following features can help guard against clickjacking:

HTTP X-Frame-Options

The X-Frame-Options HTTP response header can be used to indicate whether a browser should be allowed to render a page in a <frame>, <iframe>, <embed> or <object>. Sites can use this to avoid clickjacking attacks, by ensuring that their content is not embedded into other sites.

CSP: frame-ancestors

The HTTP Content-Security-Policy (CSP) frame-ancestors directive specifies valid parents that may embed a page using <frame>, <iframe>, <object>, or <embed>.

Practical security implementation guidesTo get comprehensive instructions for implementing security features effectively on websites and to ensure you're following best practices, see our set of Practical security implementation guides.
Some of these guides are directly related to the HTTP Observatory tool. Observatory performs security audits on a website and provides a grade and score along with recommendations for fixing the security issues it finds. These guides explain how to resolve issues surfaced by the MDN Observatory tests: the tool links to the relevant guide for each issue, helping guide you towards an effective resolution. Interestingly, Mozilla's internal developer teams use this guidance when implementing websites to ensure that security best practices are applied.See also

Some of it is non-sensitive, for example the copy shown on the public pages. Some of it is sensitive, for example customer usernames, passwords, and banking information, or internal algorithms and private product information.
Sensitive information needs to be protected, and that is the focus of web security. If that information fell into the wrong hands, it could be used to:

Put companies at a competitive disadvantage by sharing their information with competitors.
Disable or hijack their services, again causing serious problems with their operation.
Put their customer's privacy at risk, making them vulnerable to profiling, targeting, loss of data, identity theft, or even financial loss.

Modern browsers already have several features to protect users' security on the web, but developers also need to use best practices and code carefully to ensure that their websites are secure. Even simple bugs in your code can result in vulnerabilities that bad actors can exploit to steal data and gain unauthorized control over services.
This article provides an introduction to web security, including conceptual information to help you understand website vulnerabilities and practical guides on how to secure them.Relationship between security and privacySecurity and privacy are distinct yet closely related topics. It is worth knowing the differences between the two and how they relate.


Security is the act of keeping private data and systems protected against unauthorized access. This includes both company (internal) data and user and partner (external) data.


Privacy refers to the act of giving users control over how their data is collected, stored, and used, while also ensuring that it is not used irresponsibly. For example, you should let your users know what data you are collecting from them, the parties with whom it will be shared, and how it will be used. Users must be given a chance to consent to your privacy policy, have access to their data you store, and delete it if they choose to.

URIs are commonly used as targets of HTTP requests, in which case the URI represents a location for a physical resource, such as a document, a photo, binary data.
The most common type of URI is a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), which is known as the web address.
URIs can be used to trigger behaviors other than fetching a resource, including opening an email client, sending text messages, or executing JavaScript, when used in other places such as the href of an HTML <a> link.URLs and URNsURLsAny of the following URLs can be typed into your browser's address bar to tell it to load the associated document (resource):
urlhttps://developer.mozilla.org
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/search?q=URL

A URL is composed of different parts, some mandatory and others optional. A more complex example might look like this:
urlhttp://www.example.com:80/path/to/myfile.html?key1=value1&key2=value2#SomewhereInTheDocument
URNsA Uniform Resource Name (URN) is a URI that identifies a resource by name in a particular namespace.
urlurn:isbn:9780141036144
urn:ietf:rfc:7230

The two URNs correspond to

the book Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell,
the IETF specification 7230, Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing.
Syntax of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs)We will break down the following URL into its components:
urlhttp://www.example.com:80/path/to/myfile.html?key1=value1&key2=value2#SomewhereInTheDocument
Scheme
http:// is the scheme of the URL, indicating which protocol the browser must use. Usually it is the HTTP protocol or its secured version, HTTPS. The Web requires one of these two, but browsers also know how to handle other protocols such as mailto: (to open a mail client) or ftp: to handle a file transfer, so don't be surprised if you see such protocols. The schemes reference provides a list of the most common schemes, and documentation for some of them.
When using URLs in HTML content, you should generally only use a few of these URL schemes. When referring to subresources — that is, files that are being loaded as part of a larger document — you should only use the HTTP and HTTPS schemes. Increasingly, browsers are removing support for using FTP to load subresources, for security reasons.
FTP is still acceptable at the top level (such as typed directly into the browser's URL bar, or the target of a link), although some browsers may delegate loading FTP content to another application.AuthorityThe URI authority is comprised of user info (optional and usually unspecified), the host name, and the port.

www.example.com is the host name of the URI, indicating which Web server is being requested. Here, we use a domain name. It is also possible to directly use an IP address, but because it is less convenient, it is rare to do so, unless the server doesn't have a registered domain name.

:80 is the port of the URL, indicating the technical "gate" used to access the resources on the web server. It is usually omitted if the web server uses the standard ports of the HTTP protocol (80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS) to grant access to its resources. Otherwise, it is mandatory.Path
/path/to/myfile.html is the path of the URL, indicating the location of the resource on the web server. In the early days of the Web, this was an actual directory path to a physical location on the web server. Nowadays, web servers usually abstract this to an arbitrary location.Query
?key1=value1&key2=value2 is the query of the URL, which are extra parameters provided to the web server. The parameters are a list of key/value pairs prefixed by the ? symbol, and separated with the & symbol. These can be used to provide additional context about the resource being requested. Each resource location can have its own rules regarding parameters, and the only reliable way to know how specific parameters are handled is by asking the owner of the server, such as reading its documentation.Fragment
#SomewhereInTheDocument is the fragment of the URL, which is an anchor to another part of the resource itself. An anchor represents a sort of "bookmark" inside the resource, giving the browser the directions to show the content located at that "bookmarked" spot. On an HTML document, for example, the browser will scroll to the point where the anchor is defined; on a video or audio document, the browser will try to go to the time the anchor represents. It is worth noting that the part after the #, also known as the fragment identifier, is never sent to the server with the request.
There's a special text fragment feature that allows you to link to a specific part of a web page identified by its text content.Examplesurlhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn

What is a URL?\n\nURIsUniform Resource Identifiers (URI) are used to identify "resources" on the web.
URIs are commonly used as targets of HTTP requests, in which case the URI represents a location for a physical resource, such as a document, a photo, binary data.
The most common type of URI is a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), which is known as the web address.
URIs can be used to trigger behaviors other than fetching a resource, including opening an email client, sending text messages, or executing JavaScript, when used in other places such as the href of an HTML <a> link.URLs and URNsURLsAny of the following URLs can be typed into your browser's address bar to tell it to load the associated document (resource):
urlhttps://developer.mozilla.org
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/search?q=URL

A URL is composed of different parts, some mandatory and others optional. A more complex example might look like this:
urlhttp://www.example.com:80/path/to/myfile.html?key1=value1&key2=value2#SomewhereInTheDocument
URNsA Uniform Resource Name (URN) is a URI that identifies a resource by name in a particular namespace.
urlurn:isbn:9780141036144
urn:ietf:rfc:7230

The two URNs correspond to

the book Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell,
the IETF specification 7230, Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing.
Syntax of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs)We will break down the following URL into its components:
urlhttp://www.example.com:80/path/to/myfile.html?key1=value1&key2=value2#SomewhereInTheDocument
Scheme
http:// is the scheme of the URL, indicating which protocol the browser must use. Usually it is the HTTP protocol or its secured version, HTTPS. The Web requires one of these two, but browsers also know how to handle other protocols such as mailto: (to open a mail client) or ftp: to handle a file transfer, so don't be surprised if you see such protocols. The schemes reference provides a list of the most common schemes, and documentation for some of them.
When using URLs in HTML content, you should generally only use a few of these URL schemes. When referring to subresources — that is, files that are being loaded as part of a larger document — you should only use the HTTP and HTTPS schemes. Increasingly, browsers are removing support for using FTP to load subresources, for security reasons.
FTP is still acceptable at the top level (such as typed directly into the browser's URL bar, or the target of a link), although some browsers may delegate loading FTP content to another application.AuthorityThe URI authority is comprised of user info (optional and usually unspecified), the host name, and the port.

www.example.com is the host name of the URI, indicating which Web server is being requested. Here, we use a domain name. It is also possible to directly use an IP address, but because it is less convenient, it is rare to do so, unless the server doesn't have a registered domain name.

:80 is the port of the URL, indicating the technical "gate" used to access the resources on the web server. It is usually omitted if the web server uses the standard ports of the HTTP protocol (80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS) to grant access to its resources. Otherwise, it is mandatory.Path
/path/to/myfile.html is the path of the URL, indicating the location of the resource on the web server. In the early days of the Web, this was an actual directory path to a physical location on the web server. Nowadays, web servers usually abstract this to an arbitrary location.Query
?key1=value1&key2=value2 is the query of the URL, which are extra parameters provided to the web server. The parameters are a list of key/value pairs prefixed by the ? symbol, and separated with the & symbol. These can be used to provide additional context about the resource being requested. Each resource location can have its own rules regarding parameters, and the only reliable way to know how specific parameters are handled is by asking the owner of the server, such as reading its documentation.Fragment
#SomewhereInTheDocument is the fragment of the URL, which is an anchor to another part of the resource itself. An anchor represents a sort of "bookmark" inside the resource, giving the browser the directions to show the content located at that "bookmarked" spot. On an HTML document, for example, the browser will scroll to the point where the anchor is defined; on a video or audio document, the browser will try to go to the time the anchor represents. It is worth noting that the part after the #, also known as the fragment identifier, is never sent to the server with the request.
There's a special text fragment feature that allows you to link to a specific part of a web page identified by its text content.Examplesurlhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn

Web performance is how long a site takes to load, become interactive and responsive, and how smooth the content is during user interactions.
Performance concerns questions like: Is scrolling smooth? Are buttons responsive? Do pop-ups load quickly and animate fluidly?
The objective measurements include time to load, frames per second, and time to become interactive, and subjective experience means how long it feels like it takes for content to load.
The longer it takes for a site to respond, the more users will abandon the site. It is important to minimize the loading and response times and add additional features to conceal latency by making the experience as available and interactive as possible, as soon as possible, while asynchronously loading in the longer tail parts of the experience.
There are tools, APIs, and best practices that help us measure and improve web performance. We cover them in the following pages.Web performance guidesThe Performance guides are resources that describe how browsers work, what affects performance, and how to measure, optimize, and monitor performance across various aspects of your application.

Performance fundamentals

Performance means efficiency. In the context of Open Web Apps, this document explains in general what performance is, how the browser platform helps improve it, and what tools and processes you can use to test and improve it.

Populating the page: how browsers work

Users want web experiences with content that is fast to load and smooth to interact with. Therefore, a developer should strive to achieve these two goals.
To understand how to improve performance and perceived performance, it helps to understand how the browser works.

Understanding latency

Latency is the time it takes for a packet of data to travel from source to a destination. In terms of performance optimization, it's important to optimize to reduce causes of latency and to test site performance emulating high latency to optimize for users with slow or unreliable connections.

Recommended Web Performance Timings: How long is too long?

There are no clear set rules as to what constitutes a slow pace when loading pages, but there are specific guidelines for indicating content will load (1 second), idling (50ms), animating (16.7ms) and responding to user input (50 to 200ms).

Using dns-prefetch

DNS-prefetch is an attempt to resolve domain names before resources get requested. This could be a file loaded later or link target a user tries to follow.

Navigation and resource timings

Navigation timings are metrics measuring a browser's document navigation events. Resource timings are detailed network timing measurements regarding the loading of an application's resources. Both provide the same read-only properties, but navigation timing measures the main document's timings whereas the resource timing provides the times for all the assets or resources called in by that main document and the resources' requested resources.

Optimizing startup performance

Improving your startup performance is often one of the highest value performance optimizations that can be made.
Good user experience includes ensuring your app loads quickly. This article provides performance tips and suggestions for both writing new applications and porting applications to the web from other platforms.

Critical rendering path

The Critical Rendering Path is the sequence of steps the browser goes through to convert the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into pixels on the screen. Optimizing the critical render path improves render performance.
The critical rendering path includes the Document Object Model (DOM), CSS Object Model (CSSOM), render tree and layout.

Lazy loading

Lazy loading is a strategy to identify resources as non-blocking (non-critical) and load these only when needed. It's a way to shorten the length of the critical rendering path, which translates into reduced page load times.

Speculative loading

Speculative loading refers to the practice of performing navigation actions (such as DNS fetching, fetching resources, or rendering documents) before the associated pages are actually visited, based on predictions as to what pages the user is most likely to visit next.

Performance budgets

A performance budget is a limit to prevent regressions. It can apply to a file, a file type, all files loaded on a page, a specific metric (e.g., Time to Interactive), a custom metric (e.g., Time to Hero Element), or a threshold over a period of time.

Performance Monitoring: RUM vs. synthetic monitoring

Synthetic monitoring and real user monitoring (RUM) are two approaches for monitoring and providing insight into web performance. RUM and synthetic monitoring provide for different views of performance and have benefits, good use cases and shortfalls. RUM is generally best suited for understanding long-term trends whereas synthetic monitoring is very well suited to regression testing and mitigating shorter-term performance issues during development. In this article we define and compare these two performance monitoring approaches.

CSS and JavaScript animation performance

Animations are critical for a pleasurable user experience on many applications. There are many ways to implement web animations, such as CSS transitions/animations or JavaScript-based animations (using requestAnimationFrame()). In this article, we analyze the performance differences between CSS-based and JavaScript-based animation.

Animation performance and frame rate

Animation on the web can be done via SVG, JavaScript, including <canvas> and WebGL, CSS animation, <video>, animated GIFs and even animated PNGs and other image types.
The performance cost of animating a CSS property can vary from one property to another, and animating expensive CSS properties can result in Jank as the browser struggles to hit a smooth frame rate.

Web performance: brief overview

Overview of the web performance learning path. Start your journey here.

What is web performance?

This article starts the module off with a good look at what performance actually is — this includes the tools, metrics, APIs, networks, and groups of people we need to consider when thinking about performance, and how we can make performance part of our web development workflow.

How do users perceive performance?

More important than how fast your website is in milliseconds, is how fast your users perceive your site to be. These perceptions are impacted by actual page load time, idling, responsiveness to user interaction, and the smoothness of scrolling and other animations. In this article, we discuss the various loading metrics, animation, and responsiveness metrics, along with best practices to improve user perception, if not the actual timings.

Web performance basics

In addition to the front end components of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and media files, there are features that can make applications slower and features that can make applications subjectively and objectively faster. There are many APIs, developer tools, best practices, and bad practices relating to web performance. Here we'll introduce many of these features ad the basic level and provide links to deeper dives to improve performance for each topic.

HTML performance features

Some attributes and the source order of your markup can impact the performance of your website. By minimizing the number of DOM nodes, making sure the best order and attributes are used for including content such as styles, scripts, media, and third-party scripts, you can drastically improve the user experience. This article looks in detail at how HTML can be used to ensure maximum performance.

Multimedia: images and video

The lowest hanging fruit of web performance is often media optimization. Serving different media files based on each user agent's capability, size, and pixel density is possible. Additional tips like removing audio tracks from background videos can improve performance even further. In this article we discuss the impact video, audio, and image content has on performance, and the methods to ensure that impact is as minimal as possible.

CSS performance features

CSS may be a less important optimization focus for improved performance, but there are some CSS features that impact performance more than others. In this article we look at some CSS properties that impact performance and suggested ways of handling styles to ensure performance is not negatively impacted.

JavaScript performance best practices

JavaScript, when used properly, can allow for interactive and immersive web experiences — or it can significantly harm download time, render time, in-app performance, battery life, and user experience. This article outlines some JavaScript best practices that should be considered to ensure even complex content is as performant as possible.

Performance APIsThe Performance API is a group of standards used to measure the performance of web applications.
The following pages provide overviews of the Performance APIs including information on how to use them:

High precision timing

The Performance API allows high precision measurements that are based on time in potential sub-millisecond resolution and a stable monotonic clock that is not subject to system clock skew or adjustments.
The high resolution timers are needed for accurate benchmarking instead of the less precise and non-monotonic Date timestamps.

Long animation frame timing

Long animation frames (LoAFs) can impact the user experience of a website.
They can cause slow user interface (UI) updates, resulting in seemingly unresponsive controls and janky (or non-smooth) animated effects and scrolling, leading to user frustration.
The Long Animation Frames API allows developers to get information about the long animation frames and better understand their root causes. This article shows how to use the Long Animation Frames API.

Monitoring bfcache blocking reasons

The PerformanceNavigationTiming.notRestoredReasons property reports information on why the current document was blocked from using the bfcache on navigation.
Developers can use this information to identify pages that need updates to make them bfcache-compatible, thereby improving site performance.

Navigation timing

Navigation Timing provides metrics associated with navigating from one page to another via the PerformanceNavigationTiming API.
For example, you can determine how much time it takes to load or unload a document, or log the time it took until DOM construction has finished and interaction with the DOM is possible.

Performance data

The Performance API doesn't provide performance data analysis, or visualizations.
However, the Performance API is integrated well with developer tools and its data is often sent to analytics end points and libraries to record performance metrics which help you to evaluate the data to find performance bottlenecks affecting your users.
This page provides an overview about what sorts of Performance API data exists, how it is collected, and how it can be accessed.

Resource Timing API

Resource Timing enables retrieving and analyzing detailed network timing data for the loading of an application's resources.
An application can use the timing metrics to determine, for example, the length of time it takes to load a specific resource (such as an image or a script) either implicitly as part of page load or explicitly from JavaScript, for example using the fetch() API.

Server timing

Server-Timing allows servers to communicate metrics about the request-response cycle to the user agent.
You can collect this information and act on server-side metrics in the same way as all the other metrics processed with the Performance API.

User Timing API

Create application specific timestamps using the user timing API's "mark" and "measure" entry types using high-precision timestamps that are part of the browser's performance timeline.

Related APIsThe following APIs are also useful for measuring and influencing page performance:

Page Visibility API

Provides events you can watch for to know when a document becomes visible or hidden, as well as features to look at the current visibility state of the page.

Background Tasks API

The Cooperative Scheduling of Background Tasks API (also referred to as the Background Tasks API or the requestIdleCallback() API) provides the ability to queue tasks to be executed automatically by the user agent when it determines that there is free time to do so.

Beacon API

The Beacon interface schedules an asynchronous and non-blocking request to a web server.

Intersection Observer API

The Intersection Observer API provides a way to asynchronously observe changes in the intersection of a target element with an ancestor element or with a top-level document's Viewport.
This enabled use cases such as Timing element visibility to get asynchronously notified when elements of interest become visible.

Media Capabilities API

Exposes decoding and encoding abilities of a client device, such as whether media is supported and whether playback should be smooth and power efficient, with real time feedback about playback to better enable adaptive streaming, and access to display property information.

Network Information API

Information about the system's connection in terms of general connection type (e.g., 'wifi, 'cellular', etc.).
This can be used to select high definition content or low definition content based on the user's connection.

Battery Status API

The Battery API, provides information about the system's battery charge level and lets you be notified by events that are sent when the battery level or charging status change.
This can be used to adjust your app's resource usage to reduce battery drain when the battery is low, or to save changes before the battery runs out in order to prevent data loss.

Navigator.deviceMemory

The deviceMemory read-only property of the Navigator interface returns the approximate amount of device memory in gigabytes.

FetchEvent.preloadResponse

The preloadResponse read-only property of the FetchEvent interface returns a Promise that resolves to the navigation preload Response if navigation preload was triggered, or undefined otherwise.

The Performance API doesn't provide performance data analysis, or visualizations.
However, the Performance API is integrated well with developer tools and its data is often sent to analytics end points and libraries to record performance metrics which help you to evaluate the data to find performance bottlenecks affecting your users.
This page provides an overview about what sorts of Performance API data exists, how it is collected, and how it can be accessed.

Resource Timing API

Resource Timing enables retrieving and analyzing detailed network timing data for the loading of an application's resources.
An application can use the timing metrics to determine, for example, the length of time it takes to load a specific resource (such as an image or a script) either implicitly as part of page load or explicitly from JavaScript, for example using the fetch() API.

Server timing

Server-Timing allows servers to communicate metrics about the request-response cycle to the user agent.
You can collect this information and act on server-side metrics in the same way as all the other metrics processed with the Performance API.

User Timing API

Create application specific timestamps using the user timing API's "mark" and "measure" entry types using high-precision timestamps that are part of the browser's performance timeline.

Related APIsThe following APIs are also useful for measuring and influencing page performance:

Page Visibility API

Provides events you can watch for to know when a document becomes visible or hidden, as well as features to look at the current visibility state of the page.

Background Tasks API

The Cooperative Scheduling of Background Tasks API (also referred to as the Background Tasks API or the requestIdleCallback() API) provides the ability to queue tasks to be executed automatically by the user agent when it determines that there is free time to do so.

Beacon API

The Beacon interface schedules an asynchronous and non-blocking request to a web server.

Intersection Observer API

The Intersection Observer API provides a way to asynchronously observe changes in the intersection of a target element with an ancestor element or with a top-level document's Viewport.
This enabled use cases such as Timing element visibility to get asynchronously notified when elements of interest become visible.

Media Capabilities API

Exposes decoding and encoding abilities of a client device, such as whether media is supported and whether playback should be smooth and power efficient, with real time feedback about playback to better enable adaptive streaming, and access to display property information.

Network Information API

Information about the system's connection in terms of general connection type (e.g., 'wifi, 'cellular', etc.).
This can be used to select high definition content or low definition content based on the user's connection.

Battery Status API

The Battery API, provides information about the system's battery charge level and lets you be notified by events that are sent when the battery level or charging status change.
This can be used to adjust your app's resource usage to reduce battery drain when the battery is low, or to save changes before the battery runs out in order to prevent data loss.

Navigator.deviceMemory

The deviceMemory read-only property of the Navigator interface returns the approximate amount of device memory in gigabytes.

FetchEvent.preloadResponse

The preloadResponse read-only property of the FetchEvent interface returns a Promise that resolves to the navigation preload Response if navigation preload was triggered, or undefined otherwise.

Performance in Firefox Developer Tools
Help improve MDNWas this page helpful to you?YesNoLearn how to contribute.This page was last modified on May 9, 2025 by MDN contributors.View this page on GitHub • Report a problem with this content\n\nWeb performanceWeb performance is the objective measurements and the perceived user experience of load time and runtime.
Web performance is how long a site takes to load, become interactive and responsive, and how smooth the content is during user interactions.
Performance concerns questions like: Is scrolling smooth? Are buttons responsive? Do pop-ups load quickly and animate fluidly?
The objective measurements include time to load, frames per second, and time to become interactive, and subjective experience means how long it feels like it takes for content to load.
The longer it takes for a site to respond, the more users will abandon the site. It is important to minimize the loading and response times and add additional features to conceal latency by making the experience as available and interactive as possible, as soon as possible, while asynchronously loading in the longer tail parts of the experience.
There are tools, APIs, and best practices that help us measure and improve web performance. We cover them in the following pages.Web performance guidesThe Performance guides are resources that describe how browsers work, what affects performance, and how to measure, optimize, and monitor performance across various aspects of your application.

Performance fundamentals

Performance means efficiency. In the context of Open Web Apps, this document explains in general what performance is, how the browser platform helps improve it, and what tools and processes you can use to test and improve it.

Populating the page: how browsers work

Users want web experiences with content that is fast to load and smooth to interact with. Therefore, a developer should strive to achieve these two goals.
To understand how to improve performance and perceived performance, it helps to understand how the browser works.

Understanding latency

Latency is the time it takes for a packet of data to travel from source to a destination. In terms of performance optimization, it's important to optimize to reduce causes of latency and to test site performance emulating high latency to optimize for users with slow or unreliable connections.

Recommended Web Performance Timings: How long is too long?

There are no clear set rules as to what constitutes a slow pace when loading pages, but there are specific guidelines for indicating content will load (1 second), idling (50ms), animating (16.7ms) and responding to user input (50 to 200ms).

Using dns-prefetch

DNS-prefetch is an attempt to resolve domain names before resources get requested. This could be a file loaded later or link target a user tries to follow.

Navigation and resource timings

Navigation timings are metrics measuring a browser's document navigation events. Resource timings are detailed network timing measurements regarding the loading of an application's resources. Both provide the same read-only properties, but navigation timing measures the main document's timings whereas the resource timing provides the times for all the assets or resources called in by that main document and the resources' requested resources.

Optimizing startup performance

Improving your startup performance is often one of the highest value performance optimizations that can be made.
Good user experience includes ensuring your app loads quickly. This article provides performance tips and suggestions for both writing new applications and porting applications to the web from other platforms.

Critical rendering path

The Critical Rendering Path is the sequence of steps the browser goes through to convert the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into pixels on the screen. Optimizing the critical render path improves render performance.
The critical rendering path includes the Document Object Model (DOM), CSS Object Model (CSSOM), render tree and layout.

Lazy loading

Lazy loading is a strategy to identify resources as non-blocking (non-critical) and load these only when needed. It's a way to shorten the length of the critical rendering path, which translates into reduced page load times.

Speculative loading

Speculative loading refers to the practice of performing navigation actions (such as DNS fetching, fetching resources, or rendering documents) before the associated pages are actually visited, based on predictions as to what pages the user is most likely to visit next.

Performance budgets

A performance budget is a limit to prevent regressions. It can apply to a file, a file type, all files loaded on a page, a specific metric (e.g., Time to Interactive), a custom metric (e.g., Time to Hero Element), or a threshold over a period of time.

Performance Monitoring: RUM vs. synthetic monitoring

Synthetic monitoring and real user monitoring (RUM) are two approaches for monitoring and providing insight into web performance. RUM and synthetic monitoring provide for different views of performance and have benefits, good use cases and shortfalls. RUM is generally best suited for understanding long-term trends whereas synthetic monitoring is very well suited to regression testing and mitigating shorter-term performance issues during development. In this article we define and compare these two performance monitoring approaches.

CSS and JavaScript animation performance

Animations are critical for a pleasurable user experience on many applications. There are many ways to implement web animations, such as CSS transitions/animations or JavaScript-based animations (using requestAnimationFrame()). In this article, we analyze the performance differences between CSS-based and JavaScript-based animation.

Animation performance and frame rate

Animation on the web can be done via SVG, JavaScript, including <canvas> and WebGL, CSS animation, <video>, animated GIFs and even animated PNGs and other image types.
The performance cost of animating a CSS property can vary from one property to another, and animating expensive CSS properties can result in Jank as the browser struggles to hit a smooth frame rate.

Tutorials for beginnersThe MDN Web Performance Learning Area contains modern, up-to-date tutorials covering Performance essentials. Start here if you are a newcomer to performance:

Web performance: brief overview

Overview of the web performance learning path. Start your journey here.

What is web performance?

This article starts the module off with a good look at what performance actually is — this includes the tools, metrics, APIs, networks, and groups of people we need to consider when thinking about performance, and how we can make performance part of our web development workflow.

How do users perceive performance?

More important than how fast your website is in milliseconds, is how fast your users perceive your site to be. These perceptions are impacted by actual page load time, idling, responsiveness to user interaction, and the smoothness of scrolling and other animations. In this article, we discuss the various loading metrics, animation, and responsiveness metrics, along with best practices to improve user perception, if not the actual timings.

Web performance basics

In addition to the front end components of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and media files, there are features that can make applications slower and features that can make applications subjectively and objectively faster. There are many APIs, developer tools, best practices, and bad practices relating to web performance. Here we'll introduce many of these features ad the basic level and provide links to deeper dives to improve performance for each topic.

HTML performance features

Some attributes and the source order of your markup can impact the performance of your website. By minimizing the number of DOM nodes, making sure the best order and attributes are used for including content such as styles, scripts, media, and third-party scripts, you can drastically improve the user experience. This article looks in detail at how HTML can be used to ensure maximum performance.

Multimedia: images and video

The lowest hanging fruit of web performance is often media optimization. Serving different media files based on each user agent's capability, size, and pixel density is possible. Additional tips like removing audio tracks from background videos can improve performance even further. In this article we discuss the impact video, audio, and image content has on performance, and the methods to ensure that impact is as minimal as possible.

CSS performance features

CSS may be a less important optimization focus for improved performance, but there are some CSS features that impact performance more than others. In this article we look at some CSS properties that impact performance and suggested ways of handling styles to ensure performance is not negatively impacted.

JavaScript performance best practices

JavaScript, when used properly, can allow for interactive and immersive web experiences — or it can significantly harm download time, render time, in-app performance, battery life, and user experience. This article outlines some JavaScript best practices that should be considered to ensure even complex content is as performant as possible.

Performance APIsThe Performance API is a group of standards used to measure the performance of web applications.
The following pages provide overviews of the Performance APIs including information on how to use them:

High precision timing

The Performance API allows high precision measurements that are based on time in potential sub-millisecond resolution and a stable monotonic clock that is not subject to system clock skew or adjustments.
The high resolution timers are needed for accurate benchmarking instead of the less precise and non-monotonic Date timestamps.

Long animation frame timing

Long animation frames (LoAFs) can impact the user experience of a website.
They can cause slow user interface (UI) updates, resulting in seemingly unresponsive controls and janky (or non-smooth) animated effects and scrolling, leading to user frustration.
The Long Animation Frames API allows developers to get information about the long animation frames and better understand their root causes. This article shows how to use the Long Animation Frames API.

Monitoring bfcache blocking reasons

The PerformanceNavigationTiming.notRestoredReasons property reports information on why the current document was blocked from using the bfcache on navigation.
Developers can use this information to identify pages that need updates to make them bfcache-compatible, thereby improving site performance.

Navigation timing

Navigation Timing provides metrics associated with navigating from one page to another via the PerformanceNavigationTiming API.
For example, you can determine how much time it takes to load or unload a document, or log the time it took until DOM construction has finished and interaction with the DOM is possible.

Performance data

The Performance API doesn't provide performance data analysis, or visualizations.
However, the Performance API is integrated well with developer tools and its data is often sent to analytics end points and libraries to record performance metrics which help you to evaluate the data to find performance bottlenecks affecting your users.
This page provides an overview about what sorts of Performance API data exists, how it is collected, and how it can be accessed.

Resource Timing API

Resource Timing enables retrieving and analyzing detailed network timing data for the loading of an application's resources.
An application can use the timing metrics to determine, for example, the length of time it takes to load a specific resource (such as an image or a script) either implicitly as part of page load or explicitly from JavaScript, for example using the fetch() API.

Server timing

Server-Timing allows servers to communicate metrics about the request-response cycle to the user agent.
You can collect this information and act on server-side metrics in the same way as all the other metrics processed with the Performance API.

User Timing API

Create application specific timestamps using the user timing API's "mark" and "measure" entry types using high-precision timestamps that are part of the browser's performance timeline.

Media
Audio and video delivery

We can deliver audio and video on the web in several ways, ranging from 'static' media files to adaptive live streams. This article is intended as a starting point for exploring the various delivery mechanisms of web-based media and compatibility with popular browsers.

Audio and video manipulation

The beauty of the web is that you can combine technologies to create new forms. Having native audio and video in the browser means we can use these data streams with technologies such as <canvas>, WebGL or Web Audio API to modify audio and video directly, for example adding reverb/compression effects to audio, or grayscale/sepia filters to video. This article provides a reference to explain what you need to do.

APIs
Using FormData objects

The FormData object lets you compile a set of key/value pairs to send using fetch(). It's primarily intended for sending form data, but can be used independently of forms to transmit keyed data. The transmission is in the same format that the form's submit() method would use to send the data if the form's encoding type were set to "multipart/form-data".

Progressive web apps

Progressive web apps (PWAs) use modern web APIs along with traditional progressive enhancement strategy to create cross-platform web applications. These apps work everywhere and provide several features that give them the same user experience advantages as native apps. This set of guides tells you all you need to know about PWAs.

Media
Audio and video delivery

We can deliver audio and video on the web in several ways, ranging from 'static' media files to adaptive live streams. This article is intended as a starting point for exploring the various delivery mechanisms of web-based media and compatibility with popular browsers.

Audio and video manipulation

The beauty of the web is that you can combine technologies to create new forms. Having native audio and video in the browser means we can use these data streams with technologies such as <canvas>, WebGL or Web Audio API to modify audio and video directly, for example adding reverb/compression effects to audio, or grayscale/sepia filters to video. This article provides a reference to explain what you need to do.

APIs
Using FormData objects

The FormData object lets you compile a set of key/value pairs to send using fetch(). It's primarily intended for sending form data, but can be used independently of forms to transmit keyed data. The transmission is in the same format that the form's submit() method would use to send the data if the form's encoding type were set to "multipart/form-data".

Progressive web apps

Progressive web apps (PWAs) use modern web APIs along with traditional progressive enhancement strategy to create cross-platform web applications. These apps work everywhere and provide several features that give them the same user experience advantages as native apps. This set of guides tells you all you need to know about PWAs.

Parsing and serializing XML

The web platform provides different methods of parsing and serializing XML, each with its pros and cons.

It is also designed to run alongside JavaScript, allowing both to work together.In a NutshellWebAssembly has huge implications for the web platform — it provides a way to run code written in multiple languages on the web at near-native speed, with client apps running on the web that previously couldn't have done so.
WebAssembly is designed to complement and run alongside JavaScript — using the WebAssembly JavaScript APIs, you can load WebAssembly modules into a JavaScript app and share functionality between the two. This allows you to take advantage of WebAssembly's performance and power and JavaScript's expressiveness and flexibility in the same app, even if you don't know how to write WebAssembly code.
And what's even better is that it is being developed as a web standard via the W3C WebAssembly Working Group and Community Group with active participation from all major browser vendors.Guides
WebAssembly concepts

Get started by reading the high-level concepts behind WebAssembly — what it is, why it is so useful, how it fits into the web platform (and beyond), and how to use it.

Compiling a New C/C++ Module to WebAssembly

When you've written code in C/C++, you can then compile it into Wasm using a tool like Emscripten. Let's look at how it works.

Compiling an Existing C Module to WebAssembly

A core use-case for WebAssembly is to take the existing ecosystem of C libraries and allow developers to use them on the web.

Compiling from Rust to WebAssembly

If you've written some Rust code, you can compile it into WebAssembly! This tutorial takes you through all you need to know to compile a Rust project to Wasm and use it in an existing web app.

Loading and running WebAssembly code

After you have a Wasm module, this article covers how to fetch, compile and instantiate it, combining the WebAssembly JavaScript API with the Fetch or XHR APIs.

Using the WebAssembly JavaScript API

Once you've loaded a Wasm module, you'll want to use it. In this article, we show you how to use WebAssembly via the WebAssembly JavaScript API.

Exported WebAssembly functions

Exported WebAssembly functions are the JavaScript reflections of WebAssembly functions, which allow calling WebAssembly code from JavaScript. This article describes what they are.

Understanding WebAssembly text format

This article explains the Wasm text format. This is the low-level textual representation of a Wasm module shown in browser developer tools when debugging.

Converting WebAssembly text format to Wasm

WebAssembly JavaScript interface

This object acts as the namespace for all WebAssembly-related functionality.

WebAssembly.Global()

A WebAssembly.Global object represents a global variable instance, accessible from both JavaScript and importable/exportable across one or more WebAssembly.Module instances. This allows dynamic linking of multiple modules.

WebAssembly.Module()

A WebAssembly.Module object contains stateless WebAssembly code that has already been compiled by the browser and can be efficiently shared with Workers, and instantiated multiple times.

WebAssembly.Instance()

A WebAssembly.Instance object is a stateful, executable instance of a Module. Instance objects contain all the Exported WebAssembly functions that allow calling into WebAssembly code from JavaScript.

WebAssembly.compile()

Emscripting a C Library to Wasm\n\nWebAssemblyWebAssembly is a type of code that can be run in modern web browsers — it is a low-level assembly-like language with a compact binary format that runs with near-native performance and provides languages such as C/C++, C# and Rust with a compilation target so that they can run on the web. It is also designed to run alongside JavaScript, allowing both to work together.In a NutshellWebAssembly has huge implications for the web platform — it provides a way to run code written in multiple languages on the web at near-native speed, with client apps running on the web that previously couldn't have done so.
WebAssembly is designed to complement and run alongside JavaScript — using the WebAssembly JavaScript APIs, you can load WebAssembly modules into a JavaScript app and share functionality between the two. This allows you to take advantage of WebAssembly's performance and power and JavaScript's expressiveness and flexibility in the same app, even if you don't know how to write WebAssembly code.
And what's even better is that it is being developed as a web standard via the W3C WebAssembly Working Group and Community Group with active participation from all major browser vendors.Guides
WebAssembly concepts

Get started by reading the high-level concepts behind WebAssembly — what it is, why it is so useful, how it fits into the web platform (and beyond), and how to use it.

Compiling a New C/C++ Module to WebAssembly

When you've written code in C/C++, you can then compile it into Wasm using a tool like Emscripten. Let's look at how it works.

Compiling an Existing C Module to WebAssembly

A core use-case for WebAssembly is to take the existing ecosystem of C libraries and allow developers to use them on the web.

Compiling from Rust to WebAssembly

If you've written some Rust code, you can compile it into WebAssembly! This tutorial takes you through all you need to know to compile a Rust project to Wasm and use it in an existing web app.

Loading and running WebAssembly code

After you have a Wasm module, this article covers how to fetch, compile and instantiate it, combining the WebAssembly JavaScript API with the Fetch or XHR APIs.

Using the WebAssembly JavaScript API

Once you've loaded a Wasm module, you'll want to use it. In this article, we show you how to use WebAssembly via the WebAssembly JavaScript API.

Exported WebAssembly functions

Exported WebAssembly functions are the JavaScript reflections of WebAssembly functions, which allow calling WebAssembly code from JavaScript. This article describes what they are.

Understanding WebAssembly text format

This article explains the Wasm text format. This is the low-level textual representation of a Wasm module shown in browser developer tools when debugging.

Converting WebAssembly text format to Wasm

This article provides a guide on how to convert a WebAssembly module written in text format into a Wasm binary.

API reference
WebAssembly instruction reference

Reference documentation with interactive samples for the set of WebAssembly operators.

WebAssembly JavaScript interface

This object acts as the namespace for all WebAssembly-related functionality.

WebAssembly.Global()

A WebAssembly.Global object represents a global variable instance, accessible from both JavaScript and importable/exportable across one or more WebAssembly.Module instances. This allows dynamic linking of multiple modules.

WebAssembly.Module()

A WebAssembly.Module object contains stateless WebAssembly code that has already been compiled by the browser and can be efficiently shared with Workers, and instantiated multiple times.

WebAssembly.Instance()

A WebAssembly.Instance object is a stateful, executable instance of a Module. Instance objects contain all the Exported WebAssembly functions that allow calling into WebAssembly code from JavaScript.

This allows a website to describe a search engine for itself, so that a browser or other client application can use that search engine. OpenSearch is supported by (at least) Firefox, Edge, Safari, and Chrome. (See Reference Material for links to other browsers' documentation.)
Firefox also supports additional features not in the OpenSearch standard, such as search suggestions. This article focuses on creating OpenSearch-compatible search engines that support these additional Firefox features.OverviewThe address bar in browsers has a dual purpose: you can type a URL to directly go to a site, or you can type a search term to query a search engine. The search engine returns a list of results that you can browse directly, or you can open the search engine's full results page.
By default, browsers can connect to a few popular search engines, such as Google, Bing, or Yandex. The OpenSearch protocol allows websites to define their own search engines, enabling users to search those websites directly from the browser's address bar. For example, the MDN website has a site-wide search engine. If MDN registers itself as a search engine, users can search MDN directly from the address bar.
Browsers query a search engine by requesting a URL. The site defines a template for the URL to be requested, and the browser fills in the user's search terms in the specified placeholders. For example, if the search engine URL is https://example.com/search?q={searchTerms}, then the browser will request https://example.com/search?q=foo when the user types "foo" into the address bar. The search engine then generates a response—either a list of search results or a full search results page.
A site defines its search engine by linking to an XML description file in its HTML. When the user first visits the site, the browser detects this description file and registers the search engine. The browser then uses the registered search engine to handle searches from the address bar.

Note:
Chrome registers site search engines as "inactive" by default. Users must manually activate each site in the search engine settings.
OpenSearch description fileThe XML file that describes a search engine follows the basic template below. Sections in [square brackets] should be customized for your specific engine.
xml<OpenSearchDescription
  xmlns="http://a9.com/-/spec/opensearch/1.1/"
  xmlns:moz="http://www.mozilla.org/2006/browser/search/">
  <ShortName>[SNK]</ShortName>
  <Description>[Search engine full name and summary]</Description>
  <InputEncoding>[UTF-8]</InputEncoding>
  <Image width="16" height="16" type="image/x-icon">[https://example.com/favicon.ico]</Image>
  <Url type="text/html" template="[searchURL]"/>
  <Url type="application/x-suggestions+json" template="[suggestionURL]"/>
</OpenSearchDescription>


ShortName

A short name for the search engine. It must be 16 or fewer characters of plain text, with no HTML or other markup.

Description

A brief description of the search engine. It must be 1024 or fewer characters of plain text, with no HTML or other markup.

InputEncoding

The character encoding to use when submitting input to the search engine.

Image

URL of an icon for the search engine. When possible, include a 16×16 image of type image/x-icon (such as /favicon.ico) and a 64×64 image of type image/jpeg or image/png.
The URL may also use the data: URL scheme. (You can generate a data: URL from an icon file at The data: URL kitchen.)
xml<Image height="16" width="16" type="image/x-icon">https://example.com/favicon.ico</Image>
  <!-- or -->
<Image height="16" width="16">data:image/x-icon;base64,AAABAAEAEBAAA…DAAA=</Image>

Firefox caches the icon as a base64 data: URL (search plug-ins are stored in the profile's searchplugins/ folder). http: and https: URLs are converted to data: URLs when this is done.

Note:
For icons loaded remotely (that is, from https:// URLs as opposed to data: URLs), Firefox will reject icons larger than 10 kilobytes.



Url

Describes the URL or URLs to use for the search. The template attribute indicates the base URL for the search query.
Firefox supports three URL types:

type="text/html" specifies the URL for the actual search query.
type="application/x-suggestions+json" specifies the URL for fetching search suggestions. In Firefox 63 onwards, type="application/json" is accepted as an alias of this.
type="application/x-moz-keywordsearch" specifies the URL used when a keyword search is entered in the location bar. This is supported only in Firefox.

For these URL types, you can use {searchTerms} to substitute the search terms entered by the user in the search bar or location bar. Other supported dynamic search parameters are described in OpenSearch 1.1 parameters.
For search suggestions, the application/x-suggestions+json URL template is used to fetch a suggestion list in JSON format.

Linking to the OpenSearch description fileTo support autodiscovery, add a <link> element for each search engine to the <head> of your web page:
html<link
  rel="search"
  type="application/opensearchdescription+xml"
  title="[searchTitle]"
  href="[descriptionURL]" />

Replace the items in [square brackets] as explained below:

searchTitle

The name of the search to perform, such as "Search MDC" or "Yahoo! Search". This must match your plugin file's <ShortName>.

descriptionURL

The URL to the XML description file, so the browser can download it.


If your site offers multiple search engines, you can support autodiscovery for them all. For example:
html<link
  rel="search"
  type="application/opensearchdescription+xml"
  title="MySite: By Author"
  href="http://example.com/mysiteauthor.xml" />

<link
  rel="search"
  type="application/opensearchdescription+xml"
  title="MySite: By Title"
  href="http://example.com/mysitetitle.xml" />

This way, your site can offer two engines to search: one by author and another by title.

Note:
In Firefox, an icon change in the search box indicates there's a provided search plugin. (See image, the green plus sign.) Thus if a search box is not shown in the user's UI, they will receive no indication. In general, behavior varies among browsers.
Supporting automatic updates for OpenSearch descriptionThe OpenSearch description file can update automatically. To support this, include an extra Url element with type="application/opensearchdescription+xml" and rel="self". The template attribute should be the URL of the OpenSearch document to automatically update to.
For example:
xml<Url
  type="application/opensearchdescription+xml"
  rel="self"
  template="https://example.com/mysearchdescription.xml" />
Troubleshooting tipsIf there is a mistake in your XML description file, you could run into errors when adding the search engine. If the error message isn't helpful, use the following tips to troubleshoot the problem:

Check that your server serves OpenSearch descriptions with Content-Type: application/opensearchdescription+xml.
Make sure that your XML description file is well-formed. You can check by loading the file directly into a browser. Ampersands (&) in the template URL must be escaped as &amp;, and tags must be closed with a trailing slash or a matching end tag.
Make sure to include the xmlns attribute—without it, you could get the error message like "Firefox could not download the search plugin".
You must include a text/html URL — search engines including only Atom or RSS URL types (which is valid, but Firefox doesn't support) will also generate the "could not download the search plugin" error.
Remotely fetched favicons must not be larger than 10KB (see Firefox bug 361923).
As mentioned earlier, browsers may not activate site search shortcuts by default. Check the browser's settings and make sure the search engine is activated.

In addition, the search plugin service provides a logging mechanism that may be useful to plugin developers. Use about:config to set the pref browser.search.log to true. Then, logging information will appear in Firefox's Browser Console (Tools ➤ Browser Tools ➤ Browser Console) when search plugins are added.Reference Material

  xmlns="http://a9.com/-/spec/opensearch/1.1/"
  xmlns:moz="http://www.mozilla.org/2006/browser/search/">
  <ShortName>[SNK]</ShortName>
  <Description>[Search engine full name and summary]</Description>
  <InputEncoding>[UTF-8]</InputEncoding>
  <Image width="16" height="16" type="image/x-icon">[https://example.com/favicon.ico]</Image>
  <Url type="text/html" template="[searchURL]"/>
  <Url type="application/x-suggestions+json" template="[suggestionURL]"/>
</OpenSearchDescription>


ShortName

A short name for the search engine. It must be 16 or fewer characters of plain text, with no HTML or other markup.

Description

A brief description of the search engine. It must be 1024 or fewer characters of plain text, with no HTML or other markup.

InputEncoding

The character encoding to use when submitting input to the search engine.

Image

URL of an icon for the search engine. When possible, include a 16×16 image of type image/x-icon (such as /favicon.ico) and a 64×64 image of type image/jpeg or image/png.
The URL may also use the data: URL scheme. (You can generate a data: URL from an icon file at The data: URL kitchen.)
xml<Image height="16" width="16" type="image/x-icon">https://example.com/favicon.ico</Image>
  <!-- or -->
<Image height="16" width="16">data:image/x-icon;base64,AAABAAEAEBAAA…DAAA=</Image>

Firefox caches the icon as a base64 data: URL (search plug-ins are stored in the profile's searchplugins/ folder). http: and https: URLs are converted to data: URLs when this is done.

Note:
For icons loaded remotely (that is, from https:// URLs as opposed to data: URLs), Firefox will reject icons larger than 10 kilobytes.



Url

Describes the URL or URLs to use for the search. The template attribute indicates the base URL for the search query.
Firefox supports three URL types:

type="text/html" specifies the URL for the actual search query.
type="application/x-suggestions+json" specifies the URL for fetching search suggestions. In Firefox 63 onwards, type="application/json" is accepted as an alias of this.
type="application/x-moz-keywordsearch" specifies the URL used when a keyword search is entered in the location bar. This is supported only in Firefox.

For these URL types, you can use {searchTerms} to substitute the search terms entered by the user in the search bar or location bar. Other supported dynamic search parameters are described in OpenSearch 1.1 parameters.
For search suggestions, the application/x-suggestions+json URL template is used to fetch a suggestion list in JSON format.

Linking to the OpenSearch description fileTo support autodiscovery, add a <link> element for each search engine to the <head> of your web page:
html<link
  rel="search"
  type="application/opensearchdescription+xml"
  title="[searchTitle]"
  href="[descriptionURL]" />

Replace the items in [square brackets] as explained below:

searchTitle

The name of the search to perform, such as "Search MDC" or "Yahoo! Search". This must match your plugin file's <ShortName>.

descriptionURL

The URL to the XML description file, so the browser can download it.


If your site offers multiple search engines, you can support autodiscovery for them all. For example:
html<link
  rel="search"
  type="application/opensearchdescription+xml"
  title="MySite: By Author"
  href="http://example.com/mysiteauthor.xml" />

<link
  rel="search"
  type="application/opensearchdescription+xml"
  title="MySite: By Title"
  href="http://example.com/mysitetitle.xml" />

This way, your site can offer two engines to search: one by author and another by title.

Note:
In Firefox, an icon change in the search box indicates there's a provided search plugin. (See image, the green plus sign.) Thus if a search box is not shown in the user's UI, they will receive no indication. In general, behavior varies among browsers.
Supporting automatic updates for OpenSearch descriptionThe OpenSearch description file can update automatically. To support this, include an extra Url element with type="application/opensearchdescription+xml" and rel="self". The template attribute should be the URL of the OpenSearch document to automatically update to.
For example:
xml<Url
  type="application/opensearchdescription+xml"
  rel="self"
  template="https://example.com/mysearchdescription.xml" />
Troubleshooting tipsIf there is a mistake in your XML description file, you could run into errors when adding the search engine. If the error message isn't helpful, use the following tips to troubleshoot the problem:

Check that your server serves OpenSearch descriptions with Content-Type: application/opensearchdescription+xml.
Make sure that your XML description file is well-formed. You can check by loading the file directly into a browser. Ampersands (&) in the template URL must be escaped as &amp;, and tags must be closed with a trailing slash or a matching end tag.
Make sure to include the xmlns attribute—without it, you could get the error message like "Firefox could not download the search plugin".
You must include a text/html URL — search engines including only Atom or RSS URL types (which is valid, but Firefox doesn't support) will also generate the "could not download the search plugin" error.
Remotely fetched favicons must not be larger than 10KB (see Firefox bug 361923).
As mentioned earlier, browsers may not activate site search shortcuts by default. Check the browser's settings and make sure the search engine is activated.

In addition, the search plugin service provides a logging mechanism that may be useful to plugin developers. Use about:config to set the pref browser.search.log to true. Then, logging information will appear in Firefox's Browser Console (Tools ➤ Browser Tools ➤ Browser Console) when search plugins are added.Reference Material

This allows a website to describe a search engine for itself, so that a browser or other client application can use that search engine. OpenSearch is supported by (at least) Firefox, Edge, Safari, and Chrome. (See Reference Material for links to other browsers' documentation.)
Firefox also supports additional features not in the OpenSearch standard, such as search suggestions. This article focuses on creating OpenSearch-compatible search engines that support these additional Firefox features.OverviewThe address bar in browsers has a dual purpose: you can type a URL to directly go to a site, or you can type a search term to query a search engine. The search engine returns a list of results that you can browse directly, or you can open the search engine's full results page.
By default, browsers can connect to a few popular search engines, such as Google, Bing, or Yandex. The OpenSearch protocol allows websites to define their own search engines, enabling users to search those websites directly from the browser's address bar. For example, the MDN website has a site-wide search engine. If MDN registers itself as a search engine, users can search MDN directly from the address bar.
Browsers query a search engine by requesting a URL. The site defines a template for the URL to be requested, and the browser fills in the user's search terms in the specified placeholders. For example, if the search engine URL is https://example.com/search?q={searchTerms}, then the browser will request https://example.com/search?q=foo when the user types "foo" into the address bar. The search engine then generates a response—either a list of search results or a full search results page.
A site defines its search engine by linking to an XML description file in its HTML. When the user first visits the site, the browser detects this description file and registers the search engine. The browser then uses the registered search engine to handle searches from the address bar.

Note:
Chrome registers site search engines as "inactive" by default. Users must manually activate each site in the search engine settings.
OpenSearch description fileThe XML file that describes a search engine follows the basic template below. Sections in [square brackets] should be customized for your specific engine.
xml<OpenSearchDescription

</OpenSearchDescription>


ShortName

A short name for the search engine. It must be 16 or fewer characters of plain text, with no HTML or other markup.

Description

A brief description of the search engine. It must be 1024 or fewer characters of plain text, with no HTML or other markup.

InputEncoding

The character encoding to use when submitting input to the search engine.

Image

URL of an icon for the search engine. When possible, include a 16×16 image of type image/x-icon (such as /favicon.ico) and a 64×64 image of type image/jpeg or image/png.
The URL may also use the data: URL scheme. (You can generate a data: URL from an icon file at The data: URL kitchen.)

Firefox caches the icon as a base64 data: URL (search plug-ins are stored in the profile's searchplugins/ folder). http: and https: URLs are converted to data: URLs when this is done.

Note:
For icons loaded remotely (that is, from https:// URLs as opposed to data: URLs), Firefox will reject icons larger than 10 kilobytes.



Url

Describes the URL or URLs to use for the search. The template attribute indicates the base URL for the search query.

For example:
xml<Url

  rel="self"
  template="https://example.com/mysearchdescription.xml" />
Troubleshooting tipsIf there is a mistake in your XML description file, you could run into errors when adding the search engine. If the error message isn't helpful, use the following tips to troubleshoot the problem:

Check that your server serves OpenSearch descriptions with Content-Type: application/opensearchdescription+xml.
Make sure that your XML description file is well-formed. You can check by loading the file directly into a browser. Ampersands (&) in the template URL must be escaped as &amp;, and tags must be closed with a trailing slash or a matching end tag.
Make sure to include the xmlns attribute—without it, you could get the error message like "Firefox could not download the search plugin".
You must include a text/html URL — search engines including only Atom or RSS URL types (which is valid, but Firefox doesn't support) will also generate the "could not download the search plugin" error.

Instead, you define your own tags designed specifically for your needs. This is a powerful way to store data in a format that can be stored, searched, and shared. Most importantly, since the fundamental format of XML is standardized, if you share or transmit XML across systems or platforms, either locally or over the internet, the recipient can still parse the data due to the standardized XML syntax.
There are many languages based on XML, including XHTML, MathML, SVG, RSS, and RDF. You can also define your own.Structure of an XML documentThe whole structure of XML and XML-based languages is built on tags.XML declarationXML - declaration is not a tag. It is used for the transmission of the meta-data of a document.

"Correct" XML (valid and well-formed)Correct design rulesFor an XML document to be correct, the following conditions must be fulfilled:

Document must be well-formed.
Document must conform to all XML syntax rules.
Document must conform to semantic rules, which are usually set in an XML schema or a DTD (Document Type Definition).
Examplexml<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<message>
    <warning>
        Hello World
    <!--missing </warning> -->
</message>

Now let's look at a corrected version of that same document:
xml<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<message>
    <warning>
         Hello World
    </warning>
</message>

A document that contains an undefined tag is invalid. For example, if we never defined the <warning> tag, the document above wouldn't be valid.
Most browsers offer a debugger that can identify poorly-formed XML documents.Character referencesLike HTML, XML offers character references for referring to some special reserved characters (such as a greater than sign which is used for tags). There are five of these characters that you should know:



Entity
Character
Description




&lt;
<
Less than sign


&gt;
>
Greater than sign


&amp;
&
Ampersand


&quot;
"
One double-quotation mark


&apos;
'
One apostrophe (or single-quotation mark)



Even though there are only 5 declared character references, or entities, more can be added using the document's Document Type Definition. For example, to create a new &warning; entity, you can do this:
xml<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE body [
  <!ENTITY warning "Warning: Something bad happened... please refresh and try again.">
]>
<body>
  <message> &warning; </message>
</body>

You can also use numeric character references to specify special characters; for example, &#xA9; is the "©" symbol.Displaying XMLXML is usually used for descriptive purposes, but there are ways to display XML data. If you don't define a specific way for the XML to be rendered, the raw XML is displayed in the browser.
One way to style XML output is to specify CSS to apply to the document using the xml-stylesheet processing instruction.
xml<?xml-stylesheet type="text/css" href="stylesheet.css"?>

Extensible Markup Language (XML) @ W3.org
Using XML: A List Apart\n\nXML introductionXML (Extensible Markup Language) is a markup language similar to HTML, but without predefined tags to use. Instead, you define your own tags designed specifically for your needs. This is a powerful way to store data in a format that can be stored, searched, and shared. Most importantly, since the fundamental format of XML is standardized, if you share or transmit XML across systems or platforms, either locally or over the internet, the recipient can still parse the data due to the standardized XML syntax.
There are many languages based on XML, including XHTML, MathML, SVG, RSS, and RDF. You can also define your own.Structure of an XML documentThe whole structure of XML and XML-based languages is built on tags.XML declarationXML - declaration is not a tag. It is used for the transmission of the meta-data of a document.

"Correct" XML (valid and well-formed)Correct design rulesFor an XML document to be correct, the following conditions must be fulfilled:

Document must be well-formed.
Document must conform to all XML syntax rules.
Document must conform to semantic rules, which are usually set in an XML schema or a DTD (Document Type Definition).
Examplexml<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<message>
    <warning>
        Hello World
    <!--missing </warning> -->
</message>

Now let's look at a corrected version of that same document:
xml<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<message>
    <warning>
         Hello World
    </warning>
</message>

A document that contains an undefined tag is invalid. For example, if we never defined the <warning> tag, the document above wouldn't be valid.
Most browsers offer a debugger that can identify poorly-formed XML documents.Character referencesLike HTML, XML offers character references for referring to some special reserved characters (such as a greater than sign which is used for tags). There are five of these characters that you should know:



Entity
Character
Description




&lt;
<
Less than sign


&gt;
>
Greater than sign


&amp;
&
Ampersand


&quot;
"
One double-quotation mark


&apos;
'
One apostrophe (or single-quotation mark)



Even though there are only 5 declared character references, or entities, more can be added using the document's Document Type Definition. For example, to create a new &warning; entity, you can do this:
xml<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE body [
  <!ENTITY warning "Warning: Something bad happened... please refresh and try again.">
]>
<body>
  <message> &warning; </message>
</body>

You can also use numeric character references to specify special characters; for example, &#xA9; is the "©" symbol.Displaying XMLXML is usually used for descriptive purposes, but there are ways to display XML data. If you don't define a specific way for the XML to be rendered, the raw XML is displayed in the browser.
One way to style XML output is to specify CSS to apply to the document using the xml-stylesheet processing instruction.
xml<?xml-stylesheet type="text/css" href="stylesheet.css"?>

There is also another more powerful way to display XML: the Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT) which can be used to transform XML into other languages such as HTML. This makes XML incredibly versatile.
xml<?xml-stylesheet type="text/xsl" href="transform.xsl"?>

It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).
"Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.
HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special "elements" such as <head>, <title>, <body>, <header>, <footer>, <article>, <section>, <p>, <div>, <span>, <img>, <aside>, <audio>, <canvas>, <datalist>, <details>, <embed>, <nav>, <search>, <output>, <progress>, <video>, <ul>, <ol>, <li> and many others.
An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which consist of the element name surrounded by < and >. The name of an element inside a tag is case-insensitive. That is, it can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the <title> tag can be written as <Title>, <TITLE>, or in any other way. However, the convention and recommended practice is to write tags in lowercase.
The articles below can help you learn more about HTML.Beginner's tutorials
Your first website: Creating the content

This article provides a brief tour of what HTML is and how to use it, aimed at people who are completely new to web development.

Structuring content with HTML

Our Learn web development section's HTML module teaches all the HTML fundamentals from the ground up.

Guides
HTML forms

Forms are a very important part of the Web — these provide much of the functionality you need for interacting with websites, e.g., registering and logging in, sending feedback, buying products, and more. This module gets you started with creating the client-side/front-end parts of forms.

CORS enabled image

The crossorigin attribute, in combination with an appropriate CORS header, allows images defined by the <img> element to be loaded from foreign origins and used in a <canvas> element as if they were being loaded from the current origin.

CORS settings attributes

Some HTML elements that provide support for CORS, such as <img> or <video>, have a crossorigin attribute (crossOrigin property), which lets you configure the CORS requests for the element's fetched data.

Preloading content with rel="preload"

The preload value of the <link> element's rel attribute allows you to write declarative fetch requests in your HTML <head>, specifying resources that your pages will need very soon after loading, which you therefore want to start preloading early in the lifecycle of a page load, before the browser's main rendering machinery kicks in. This ensures that they are made available earlier and are less likely to block the page's first render, leading to performance improvements. This article provides a basic guide to how preload works.

Responsive images

In this article, we'll learn about the concept of responsive images — images that work well on devices with widely differing screen sizes, resolutions, and other such features — and look at what tools HTML provides to help implement them. This helps to improve performance across different devices.

Reference
HTML reference

HTML consists of elements, each of which may be modified by some number of attributes. HTML documents are connected to each other with links.

HTML element reference

Browse a list of all HTML elements.

HTML attribute reference

Elements in HTML have attributes. These are additional values that configure the elements or adjust their behavior in various ways.

Global attributes

Global attributes may be specified on all HTML elements, even those not specified in the standard. This means that any non-standard elements must still permit these attributes, even though those elements make the document HTML5-noncompliant.

Inline-level elements and block-level elements

HTML elements are usually "inline-level" or "block-level" elements. An inline-level element occupies only the space bounded by the tags that define it. A block-level element occupies the entire space of its parent element (container), thereby creating a "block box".

HTML comments

HTML comments are used to add explanatory notes to the markup or to prevent the browser from interpreting specific parts of the document.

Guide to media types and formats on the web

The <audio> and <video> elements allow you to play audio and video media natively within your content without the need for external software support.

HTML content categories

HTML is comprised of several kinds of content, each of which is allowed to be used in certain contexts and is disallowed in others. Similarly, each context has a set of other content categories it can contain and elements that can or can't be used in them. This is a guide to these categories.

CORS enabled image

The crossorigin attribute, in combination with an appropriate CORS header, allows images defined by the <img> element to be loaded from foreign origins and used in a <canvas> element as if they were being loaded from the current origin.

CORS settings attributes

Some HTML elements that provide support for CORS, such as <img> or <video>, have a crossorigin attribute (crossOrigin property), which lets you configure the CORS requests for the element's fetched data.

Preloading content with rel="preload"

The preload value of the <link> element's rel attribute allows you to write declarative fetch requests in your HTML <head>, specifying resources that your pages will need very soon after loading, which you therefore want to start preloading early in the lifecycle of a page load, before the browser's main rendering machinery kicks in. This ensures that they are made available earlier and are less likely to block the page's first render, leading to performance improvements. This article provides a basic guide to how preload works.

Responsive images

In this article, we'll learn about the concept of responsive images — images that work well on devices with widely differing screen sizes, resolutions, and other such features — and look at what tools HTML provides to help implement them. This helps to improve performance across different devices.

Reference
HTML reference

HTML consists of elements, each of which may be modified by some number of attributes. HTML documents are connected to each other with links.

HTML element reference

Browse a list of all HTML elements.

HTML attribute reference

Elements in HTML have attributes. These are additional values that configure the elements or adjust their behavior in various ways.

Global attributes

Global attributes may be specified on all HTML elements, even those not specified in the standard. This means that any non-standard elements must still permit these attributes, even though those elements make the document HTML5-noncompliant.

Inline-level elements and block-level elements

HTML elements are usually "inline-level" or "block-level" elements. An inline-level element occupies only the space bounded by the tags that define it. A block-level element occupies the entire space of its parent element (container), thereby creating a "block box".

HTML comments

HTML comments are used to add explanatory notes to the markup or to prevent the browser from interpreting specific parts of the document.

Guide to media types and formats on the web

The <audio> and <video> elements allow you to play audio and video media natively within your content without the need for external software support.

HTML content categories

HTML is comprised of several kinds of content, each of which is allowed to be used in certain contexts and is disallowed in others. Similarly, each context has a set of other content categories it can contain and elements that can or can't be used in them. This is a guide to these categories.

"Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.
HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special "elements" such as <head>, <title>, <body>, <header>, <footer>, <article>, <section>, <p>, <div>, <span>, <img>, <aside>, <audio>, <canvas>, <datalist>, <details>, <embed>, <nav>, <search>, <output>, <progress>, <video>, <ul>, <ol>, <li> and many others.
An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which consist of the element name surrounded by < and >. The name of an element inside a tag is case-insensitive. That is, it can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the <title> tag can be written as <Title>, <TITLE>, or in any other way. However, the convention and recommended practice is to write tags in lowercase.

Ihre erste Website: Erstellen der Inhalte

Dieser Artikel bietet eine kurze Einführung in das, was HTML ist und wie man es verwendet, und richtet sich an Personen, die völlig neu in der Webentwicklung sind.

Inhalte mit HTML strukturieren

Unser Leitfaden zur Webentwicklung im HTML-Modul vermittelt alle HTML-Grundlagen von Grund auf.

Leitfäden
HTML-Formulare

Formulare sind ein sehr wichtiger Bestandteil des Webs - sie bieten viel der Funktionalität, die Sie für die Interaktion mit Websites benötigen, z. B. Registrierung und Anmeldung, Feedback senden, Produkte kaufen und mehr. Dieses Modul gibt Ihnen eine Einführung in die Erstellung der clientseitigen/front-end Teile von Formularen.

CORS-fähiges Bild

Das Attribut crossorigin ermöglicht es zusammen mit einem geeigneten CORS-Header, dass Bilder, die durch das <img>-Element definiert sind, von fremden Ursprüngen geladen und in einem <canvas>-Element verwendet werden können, als ob sie vom aktuellen Ursprung geladen würden.

CORS-Einstellungen für Attribute

Einige HTML-Elemente, die Unterstützung für CORS bieten, wie <img> oder <video>, haben ein crossorigin-Attribut (crossOrigin-Eigenschaft), das Ihnen erlaubt, die CORS-Anfragen für die abgerufenen Daten des Elements zu konfigurieren.

Inhalte mit rel="preload" vorladen

Der preload-Wert des rel-Attributs des <link>-Elements ermöglicht es Ihnen, deklarative Abrufanforderungen in Ihr HTML-<head> zu schreiben. Dabei geben Sie Ressourcen an, die Ihre Seiten sehr bald nach dem Laden benötigen und die Sie daher frühzeitig im Lebenszyklus eines Seitenladevorgangs vorladen möchten, bevor der Hauptbrowser-Rendering-Mechanismus einsetzt. Dies stellt sicher, dass sie früher verfügbar gemacht und die erste Darstellung der Seite weniger wahrscheinlich blockiert wird, was zu Leistungsverbesserungen führt. Dieser Artikel bietet einen grundlegenden Leitfaden dazu, wie preload funktioniert.

Responsive Bilder

In diesem Artikel werden wir das Konzept der responsiven Bilder erlernen - Bilder, die gut auf Geräten mit stark unterschiedlichen Bildschirmgrößen, Auflösungen und anderen ähnlichen Merkmalen funktionieren - und sehen, welche Werkzeuge HTML bietet, um sie zu implementieren. Dies hilft, die Leistung auf verschiedenen Geräten zu verbessern.

Referenz
HTML-Referenz

HTML besteht aus Elementen, von denen jedes durch eine Anzahl von Attributen modifiziert werden kann. HTML-Dokumente sind durch Links miteinander verbunden.

HTML-Element-Referenz

Durchsuchen Sie eine Liste aller HTML-Elemente.

HTML-Attribut-Referenz

Elemente in HTML haben Attribute. Diese sind zusätzliche Werte, die die Elemente konfigurieren oder deren Verhalten auf verschiedene Arten anpassen.

Globale Attribute

Globale Attribute können auf alle HTML-Elemente angewendet werden, selbst auf die, die nicht im Standard spezifiziert sind. Dies bedeutet, dass alle nicht standardisierten Elemente trotzdem diese Attribute erlauben müssen, auch wenn diese Elemente das Dokument HTML5-nichtkonform machen.

Inline-Level-Elemente und Block-Level-Elemente

HTML-Elemente sind in der Regel "Inline-Level"- oder "Block-Level"-Elemente. Ein Inline-Level-Element nimmt nur den Platz ein, der durch die Tags definiert wird, die es umgeben. Ein Block-Level-Element nimmt den gesamten Platz seines übergeordneten Elements (Containers) ein und bildet so eine "Blockbox".

HTML-Kommentare

HTML-Kommentare werden verwendet, um erklärende Anmerkungen zum Markup hinzuzufügen oder zu verhindern, dass der Browser bestimmte Teile des Dokuments interpretiert.

Leitfaden zu Medientypen und -formaten im Web

Die <audio>- und <video>-Elemente ermöglichen es Ihnen, Audio- und Videomedien nativ innerhalb Ihrer Inhalte abzuspielen, ohne dass eine externe Softwareunterstützung erforderlich ist.

HTML-Inhaltskategorien

HTML besteht aus verschiedenen Arten von Inhalten, die jeweils in bestimmten Kontexten verwendet werden dürfen und in anderen nicht. Ebenso hat jeder Kontext eine Reihe von anderen Inhaltskategorien, die er enthalten kann, und Elemente, die darin verwendet werden dürfen oder nicht. Dies ist ein Leitfaden zu diesen Kategorien.

Quirks-Modus und Standardsmodus

Elementos en línea y Elementos a nivel de bloque

Los elementos HTML suelen ser elementos "en línea" o "a nivel de bloque". Un elemento en línea ocupa solo el espacio delimitado por las etiquetas que lo definen. Un elemento a nivel de bloque ocupa todo el espacio de su elemento padre (contenedor), creando así un "bloque".

Tipos de enlaces

En HTML, se pueden usar varios tipos de enlaces para establecer y definir la relación entre dos documentos. Los elementos de enlace en los que se pueden configurar tipos incluyen <a>, <area> y <link>.

Este módulo prepara el escenario para que te acostumbres a conceptos y sintaxis importantes, tal como la aplicación de HTML al texto, cómo crear hipervínculos y cómo utilizar HTML para estructurar una página web.

Multimedia e inserción

Este módulo explora cómo usar HTML para incluir multimedia en tus páginas web, incluidas las diferentes formas en que se pueden incluir imágenes y cómo insertar video, audio e incluso otras páginas web completas.

tablas HTML

Representar datos tabulares en una página web de una manera comprensible y accesible puede ser un desafío. Este módulo cubre el marcado básico de tablas, junto con características más complejas como la implementación de subtítulos y resúmenes.

Formularios HTML

Los formularios son una parte muy importante de la Web — proporcionan gran parte de la funcionalidad que necesitas para interactuar con sitios web, p. ej. registrarte e iniciar sesión, enviar comentarios, comprar productos y más. Este módulo te ayuda a comenzar a crear las partes de formularios del lado del cliente/Interfaz de usuario.

Utilizar HTML para resolver problemas comunes

Proporciona enlaces a secciones de contenido que explican cómo usar HTML para resolver muchos problemas comunes al crear una página web: tratar con títulos, agregar imágenes o videos, enfatizar el contenido, crear un formulario básico, etc.

Temas avanzados
Imagen compatible con CORS

El atributo crossorigin, en combinación con un encabezado CORS apropiado, permite imágenes definidas por el elemento <img> que se cargarán desde orígenes externos y se utilizarán en un elemento <canvas> como si se estuvieran cargando desde el origen actual.

Atributos de configuración de CORS

Algunos elementos HTML que brindan soporte para CORS, como <img> o <video>, tienen un atributo crossorigin (propiedad crossOrigin), que te permite configurar las solicitudes CORS para los datos extraídos del elemento.

Precarga de contenido con rel='preload'

El valor de preload del atributo <link> del elemento rel te permite escribir solicitudes de recuperación declarativas en tu HTML <head>, que especifican los recursos que tus páginas necesitarán muy pronto después de la carga, que por lo tanto deseas comenzar a precargar al principio del ciclo de vida de la carga de una página, antes de la representación principal del navegador la maquinaria entra en acción. Esto asegura que estén disponibles antes y es menos probable que bloqueen el primer procesamiento de la página, lo que lleva a mejoras de rendimiento. Este artículo proporciona una guía básica sobre cómo funciona preload.

Referencias
Referencia HTML

HTML consta de elementos, cada uno de los cuales se puede modificar por medio de algunos atributos. Los documentos HTML están conectados entre sí mediante enlaces.

Referencia del elemento HTML

Examina una lista de todos los elementos HTML.

Referencia de atributos HTML

Los elementos en HTML tienen atributos. Se trata de valores adicionales que configuran los elementos o ajustan su comportamiento de diversas formas.

Atributos globales

Los atributos globales se pueden especificar en todos los elementos HTML, incluso aquellos no especificados en el estándar. Esto significa que cualquier elemento no estándar debe permitir esos atributos, aunque esos elementos hagan que el documento no sea compatible con HTML5.

Elementos en línea y Elementos a nivel de bloque

Los elementos HTML suelen ser elementos "en línea" o "a nivel de bloque". Un elemento en línea ocupa solo el espacio delimitado por las etiquetas que lo definen. Un elemento a nivel de bloque ocupa todo el espacio de su elemento padre (contenedor), creando así un "bloque".

Tipos de enlaces

En HTML, se pueden usar varios tipos de enlaces para establecer y definir la relación entre dos documentos. Los elementos de enlace en los que se pueden configurar tipos incluyen <a>, <area> y <link>.

Guía de tipos y formatos de medios en la web

Los elementos <audio> y <video> te permiten reproducir audio y video de forma nativa dentro de tu contenido sin la necesidad de soporte de software externo.

Categorías de contenido HTML

HTML se compone de varios tipos de contenido, cada uno de los cuales se puede usar en ciertos contextos y no está permitido en otros. De manera similar, cada uno tiene un conjunto de otras categorías de contenido que pueden recibir y elementos que pueden o no se pueden usar en ellos. Esta es una guía para estas categorías.

Modo Quirks y modo estándar

Información histórica sobre el modo peculiar («Quirks» en inglés) y el modo estándar.

Tutoriels pour les débutantsLa section Apprendre HTML contient plusieurs modules pour vous apprendre à utiliser HTML — sans autre connaissance particulière.

Une introduction à HTML

Dans ce module, on brosse un premier portrait de HTML pour présenter les concepts importants, la syntaxe. On voit comment appliquer HTML sur du texte, comment créer des hyperliens et comment structurer une page web grâce à HTML.

Le multimédia et l'intégration

Dans ce module, on explore comment utiliser HTML pour intégrer des fichiers multimédias dans une page web. Cela couvre les différentes façons d'inclure une image, comment ajouter une vidéo ou un fichier audio voire aussi comment intégrer d'autres pages web.

Les tableaux HTML

Il est parfois compliqué de représenter des données tabulaires de façon compréhensible et lisible sur une page web. Dans ce module, on voit les différentes balises utilisées pour construire des tableaux et certaines fonctionnalités plus complexes comme les légendes et résumés.

Les formulaires HTML

Les formulaires sont cruciaux sur le Web, ils permettent de créer un compte sur un site, de se connecter, d'acheter des produits, d'écrire des commentaires, etc. Dans ce module, on voit comment créer des formulaires pour le navigateur (« côté client »).

Utiliser HTML pour résoudre des problèmes courants

Ce module fournit un ensemble d'articles au sujet des problèmes qu'on rencontre fréquemment lorsqu'on crée une page web : gérer les titres, ajouter des images ou des vidéos, mettre en avant une partie du texte, créer un formulaire, etc.

Sujets avancés
Images avec le contrôle d'accès HTTP

L'attribut crossorigin, associé à un en-tête CORS approprié, permet de charger des images définies par l'élément <img> depuis des origines étrangères et de les utiliser dans un élément <canvas> comme si elles étaient chargées depuis l'origine actuelle.

Attributs de réglage du CORS

Certains éléments HTML qui fournissent un support pour CORS, tels que <img> ou <video>, ont un attribut crossorigin (propriété crossOrigin), qui vous permet de configurer les requêtes CORS pour les données extraites de l'élément.

Précharger du contenu avec rel="preload"

La valeur preload de l'attribut <link> de l'élément rel vous permet d'écrire des requêtes déclaratives de récupération dans votre <head> HTML, en spécifiant les ressources dont vos pages auront besoin très rapidement après le chargement, et que vous souhaitez donc commencer à précharger au début du cycle de vie d'une page, avant que le cycle de rendu du navigateur ne se mette en marche. Cela permet de s'assurer que ces éléments sont disponibles plus tôt et qu'ils risquent moins de bloquer le premier rendu de la page, améliorant ainsi les performances. Cet article fournit un guide de base sur le fonctionnement du preload.

Référence HTML

HTML est un langage décrivant la structure et le contenu sémantique d'un document web. Il est constitué d'éléments, chacun pouvant être paramétré grâce à différents attributs. Les documents HTML sont connectés à d'autres via des liens

Référence des éléments HTML

Cette page liste les différents éléments HTML.

Liste des attributs HTML

Les éléments du langage HTML possèdent des attributs. Il s'agit de valeurs supplémentaires qui configurent les éléments ou ajustent leur comportement de diverses manières.

Attributs universels

Les attributs universels peuvent être spécifiés sur tous les éléments HTML, même ceux qui ne sont pas spécifiés dans la norme. Par exemple, les navigateurs qui prennent en charge HTML5 masquent les contenus marqués comme <toto hidden>…<toto> , bien que <toto> ne soit pas un élément valide HTML.

Éléments en ligne et éléments de bloc

Les éléments HTML sont habituellement des éléments « en ligne » ou des éléments de bloc. Un élément en ligne occupe seulement l'espace associé aux balises. Les éléments de bloc sont une catégorie d'éléments HTML opposés aux éléments en ligne. Leur caractéristique principale réside dans le fait qu'ils sont séparés par un saut de ligne avant et après l'élément. Ce faisant, ils prennent la largeur de leurs conteneurs (créant ainsi un bloc de contenu).

Types de lien

Les différents liens permettent de décrire les relations entre deux documents qui sont reliés entre eux par un élément <a>, <area> ou <link>.

Formats de média audio et vidéo pris en charge par HTML

Les éléments <audio> et <video> permettent d'ajouter des médias audio et vidéo directement dans le navigateur (sans avoir à utiliser des plugins ou programmes tiers).

Types de contenu HTML

HTML s'organise selon différents types de contenu dont chacun peut être autorisé ou non en fonction du contexte. Ces catégories indiquent quels éléments peuvent être contenus ou non dans d'autres éléments. Cet article explique le fonctionnement de ces catégories.

以下の記事が HTML についてもっと学ぶのに役立ちます。初心者向けチュートリアル
初めてのウェブサイト: コンテンツの作成

この記事では、 HTML とは何か、また、どのように使用するのかについて、ウェブ開発に完全に新しい人々を対象に、簡単なツアーを提供します。

HTML によるコンテンツの構造化

ウェブ開発の学習の HTML モジュールの節では、 HTML の基礎をすべて一から学べます。

ガイド
HTML フォーム

フォームはウェブで非常に重要な部分です。――これはウェブサイトとのやり取り（登録やログイン、フィードバックの送信、商品の購入など）に必要な多くの機能を提供します。このモジュールでは、フォームのクライアント側／フロントエンド部分の作成から始めます。

CORS を利用した画像

crossorigin 属性と CORS ヘッダーを組み合わせることで、 <img> 要素で定義された画像を異なるドメインから読み出し、 それを <canvas> 要素の中で同じドメインから読み出したかのように扱うことができます。

CORS 設定属性

CORS をサポートするいくつかの HTML 要素（<img> や <video> など）は crossorigin 属性（crossOrigin プロパティ）を持っており、要素が取得したデータに関する CORS リクエストを設定することができます。

rel="preload" によるコンテンツの先読み

HTML の <head> 要素内において、 <link> 要素で rel 属性に preload を指定することで、読み込み後すぐにページに必要なリソース、つまりページ読み込みの過程の初期の、ブラウザーの主なレンダリング機構が起動する前に、先読みを始めたいものを指定する宣言的なフェッチリクエストを記述することができます。これにより、ページの最初のレンダリングがブロックされにくくなり、パフォーマンスが向上します。この記事では preload がどのように動作するのかについての基本的なガイドを提供します。

レスポンシブ画像

この記事では、レスポンシブ画像という概念について学びます。レスポンシブ画像とは、画面サイズや解像度、他にも様々な機能が異なる端末でも適切に表示される画像のことです。また、 HTML でレスポンシブ画像を実装するために役立つツールについても見ていきます。これにより、さまざまな端末でパフォーマンスを向上させることができます。

リファレンス
HTML リファレンス

HTML は要素の集まりで、それぞれの要素がいくつかの属性で修飾される場合があります。 HTML 文書は互いにリンクで接続されます。

HTML 要素リファレンス

すべての HTML 要素の一覧を閲覧します。

HTML 属性リファレンス

HTML の要素には属性があります。これは要素を調整したり、さまざまな方法で振る舞いを調整したりするための付加的な値です。

グローバル属性

グローバル属性は、標準仕様で規定されていないものを含むすべての HTML 要素に指定できるものです。つまり、あらゆる標準外の要素も、それを使用することで文書が HTML5 に準拠しなくなるとしても、グローバル属性を受け入れなければならないということです。

インラインレベル要素とブロックレベル要素

通常、 HTML の要素は「インラインレベル」要素または「ブロックレベル」要素のどちらかです。インラインレベル要素は、要素を定義するタグによって指定された範囲のみを占有します。ブロックレベル要素は親要素（コンテナー）の範囲全体を占有し、それによって「ブロックボックス」を作成します。

HTML コメント

HTML コメントは、マークアップに説明メモを追加したり、文書内の特定の部分をブラウザーが解釈しないようにしたりするために使用します。

ウェブにおけるメディア種別と形式のガイド

<audio> および <video> 要素では、外部のソフトウェアの支援を必要とせずにコンテンツの中でネイティブに音声や動画を再生できます。

HTML コンテンツカテゴリー

HTML は数種類のコンテンツで構成されています。それぞれのコンテンツは特定のコンテキストで使用することができ、それ以外のコンテキストでは使用できません。同様に、それぞれのコンテキストには、格納することができる他のコンテンツカテゴリーと、その中で使用できる要素、または使用できない要素の集合があります。これは、これらのカテゴリーへのガイドです

後方互換モードと標準準拠モード

後方互換モードと標準準拠モードの歴史的な情報です。

crossorigin 属性と CORS ヘッダーを組み合わせることで、 <img> 要素で定義された画像を異なるドメインから読み出し、 それを <canvas> 要素の中で同じドメインから読み出したかのように扱うことができます。

CORS 設定属性

CORS をサポートするいくつかの HTML 要素（<img> や <video> など）は crossorigin 属性（crossOrigin プロパティ）を持っており、要素が取得したデータに関する CORS リクエストを設定することができます。

rel="preload" によるコンテンツの先読み

HTML の <head> 要素内において、 <link> 要素で rel 属性に preload を指定することで、読み込み後すぐにページに必要なリソース、つまりページ読み込みの過程の初期の、ブラウザーの主なレンダリング機構が起動する前に、先読みを始めたいものを指定する宣言的なフェッチリクエストを記述することができます。これにより、ページの最初のレンダリングがブロックされにくくなり、パフォーマンスが向上します。この記事では preload がどのように動作するのかについての基本的なガイドを提供します。

レスポンシブ画像

この記事では、レスポンシブ画像という概念について学びます。レスポンシブ画像とは、画面サイズや解像度、他にも様々な機能が異なる端末でも適切に表示される画像のことです。また、 HTML でレスポンシブ画像を実装するために役立つツールについても見ていきます。これにより、さまざまな端末でパフォーマンスを向上させることができます。

「ハイパーテキスト」はウェブページから別なページに、ウェブサイト内でもウェブサイト間でも、接続するリンクを示します。リンクはウェブの基礎的な特徴です。コンテンツをインターネットにアップロードして他の人々が作成したページにリンクすれば、 World Wide Web の活発な参加者になれます。
HTML ではウェブブラウザーのテキスト、画像、その他のコンテンツを記述するために「マークアップ」を使用します。 HTML のマークアップには、 <head>, <title>, <body>, <header>, <footer>, <article>, <section>, <p>, <div>, <span>, <img>, <aside>, <audio>, <canvas>, <datalist>, <details>, <embed>, <nav>, <search>, <output>, <progress>, <video>, <ul>, <ol>, <li> その他のたくさんの特殊な「要素」を用います。
HTML 要素は文書中で、< および > で囲まれた要素名で構成される「タグ」によって区別されます。タグ内の要素名は、大文字と小文字の区別がありません。つまり、大文字でも、小文字でも、混在して書いても構いません。例えば、 <title> タグは <Title> や <TITLE> やその他の方法で書くことができます。ただし、タグを小文字で書くのが慣習となっており、推奨されています。

Define o significado e a estrutura do conteúdo da web. Outras tecnologias além do HTML geralmente são usadas para descrever a aparência/apresentação (CSS) ou a funcionalidade/comportamento (JavaScript) de uma página da web.
"Hipertexto" refere-se aos links que conectam páginas da Web entre si, seja dentro de um único site ou entre sites. Links são um aspecto fundamental da web. Ao carregar conteúdo na Internet e vinculá-lo a páginas criadas por outras pessoas, você se torna um participante ativo na world wide web.
O HTML usa "Marcação" para anotar texto, imagem e outros conteúdos para exibição em um navegador da Web. A marcação HTML inclui "elementos" especiais, como <head>, <title>, <body>, <header>, <footer>, <article>, <section>, <p>, <div>, <span>, <img>, <aside>, <audio>, <canvas>, <datalist>, <details>, <embed>, <nav>, <output>, <progress>, <video>, <ul>, <ol>, <li> e muitos outros.
Um elemento HTML é separado de outro texto em um documento por "tags", que consistem no nome do elemento entre "<" e ">". O nome de um elemento dentro de uma tag é insensível a maiúsculas e minúsculas. Isto é, pode ser escrito em maiúsculas, minúsculas ou um mistura. Por exemplo, a tag <title> pode ser escrita como <Title>, <TITLE> ou de qualquer outra forma.

Referência do HTML
Em nossa extensa seção de Referência do HTML, você encontrará os detalhes sobre cada elemento e atributo do HTML.

Tutoriais para iniciantesNossa Área de Aprendizado de HTML apresenta vários módulos que ensinam HTML desde o início — sem necessidade de conhecimento prévio.

Introdução ao HTML

Este módulo fornece uma base de conhecimento, permitindo que você acostume-se com os conceitos e sintaxes importantes, tais como aplicar HTML para texto, como criar hyperlinks e como usar HTML para estruturar uma página web.

Multimídia e como incorporá-la

Este módulo explora como usar HTML para incluir multimídia em sua página web, incluindo as diferentes maneiras para incluir imagens, e como incorporar vídeos, áudios e até como colocar uma página inteira em outras páginas web.

Tabelas HTML

Representar dados tabulares em uma página web de maneira entendível e acessível pode ser um desafio. Este módulo cobre marcação tabular básica, junto com outras funcionalidades mais complexas como legendas e sumários.

Formulários HTML

Formulários são partes muito importantes na Web — proporcionam muitas das funcionalidades que você precisa para interagir em páginas web. Exemplos disso são registrar-se e conectar-se, enviar comentários, comprar produtos e muito mais. Este módulo lhe permite começar a criar as partes visíveis dos formulários, ou seja, as partes que os usuários interagem.

Usando HTML para resolver problemas comuns

Apresenta links para seções com conteúdo explicando como usar HTML para resolver problemas muito comuns, quando se cria uma página web: como trabalhar com títulos, agregar imagens ou vídeos, colocar ênfase em conteúdo, criar um formulário básico, etc.

Habilitando Imagem CORS

O atributo crossorigin, em combinação com um cabeçalho CORS adequado, permite definir imagens pelo elemento <img> para ser carregado de outras fontes em um elemento <canvas> como se estivessem sendo carregados da fonte atual.

Configuração de atributos CORS

Alguns elementos em HTML que suportam CORS, como por exemplo o <img> ou <video>, têm o atributo crossorigin (a propriedade crossOrigin), que permite configurar as requisições CORS para os dados recebidos pelo elemento.

Gerenciamento de foco em HTML

O atributo DOM activeElement e o método DOM hasFocus() lhe ajudam a melhorar a interação entre o usuário e os elementos da página.

Tipos de conexões

Em HTML, vários tipos de links podem ser utilizados para realizar conexões entre documentos, como por exemplo <a>, <area> e <link>.

Formatos de arquivos suportados pelos elementos de áudio e vídeo em HTML

Os elementos <audio> e <video> permitem que você reproduza áudios e vídeos no seu HTML. Estes elementos fornecem uma alternativa nativa de recursos do navegador, parecidos com a do Adobe Flash Player e outros plug-ins.

Usando o cachê de aplicação

O cachê de aplicação tem como o objetivo executar a aplicação offline. Você pode usar a interface Application Cache (AppCache) para escolher elementos que o browser possa guardar, deixando-os disponíveis para usuários desconectados. As aplicações que forem armazenadas em cache podem ser utilizadas sem nenhum problema, mesmo que o usuário clique no botão de atualizar a página enquanto estiver offline.

Pré-carregando conteúdo com rel="preload"

O valor preload do atributo rel do elemento <link> permite que você escreva solicitações de busca declarativas em seu elemento <head> do HTML, especificando recursos que suas páginas vão utilizar logo após o carregamento. Você também pode necessitar que estes recursos sejam pré-carregados ao início do ciclo de execução da página e depois que o mecanismo de renderização do navegador comece a agir. Isso garante que estarão disponíveis mais cedo e que seja menos provável que sua página seja bloqueada do processo de renderizar. Isso aumenta a performance da página. Este artigo oferece um guia básico de como preload funciona.

Referência do HTML

HTML é formado de elementos, onde cada um deles pode ser modificado por alguns atributos. Documentos HTML são interconectados através de links.

Referência dos Elementos HTML

Navegue em uma lista com todos os elementos HTML.

Referência de atributos em HTML

Elementos em HTML possuem atributos. Estes configuram ou ajustam o funcionamento e o comportamento dos seus elementos de muitas maneiras.

Atributos Globais

Os atributos globais podem ser utilizados em todos os elementos HTML, mesmo aqueles que não são especificados como padrão. Isso significa que qualquer elemento não padrão vai permitir estes atributos, mesmo que este retorne um documento HTML5 incompatível.

Elementos em linha e Elementos em nível de bloco

Elementos HTML são normalmente elementos inline (em linha) ou block-level (em nível de bloco). Um elemento em linha ocupa somente o espaço limitado pelas tags que o definem. Um elemento em nível de bloco ocupa o espaço inteiro do elemento pai (container), portanto criando um bloco.

Tipos de Links

No HTML, vários tipos de links podem ser utilizados para estabelecer e definir o relacionamento entre dois documentos. Os tipos de elementos de link que podem ser incluídos são <a>, <area> e <link>.

Formatos de mídia suportados pelos elementos vídeo e áudio do HTML

Os elementos <audio> e <video> permitem que você reproduza mídias de áudio e vídeo. Estes elementos fornecem uma alternativa nativa para o navegador reproduzir recursos similares aos encontrados no Adobe Flash e outros plug-ins.

Tipos de conteúdo HTML

O HTML é composto de uma grande diversidade de conteúdos, e cada um pode ser usado em certos contextos e não ser permitido em outros. Da mesma forma, cada um tem um conjunto de outras categorias de conteúdos que podem ou não serem usadas dentro deles. Este é um guia destas categorias.

Outras tecnologias além do HTML geralmente são usadas para descrever a aparência/apresentação (CSS) ou a funcionalidade/comportamento (JavaScript) de uma página da web.
"Hipertexto" refere-se aos links que conectam páginas da Web entre si, seja dentro de um único site ou entre sites. Links são um aspecto fundamental da web. Ao carregar conteúdo na Internet e vinculá-lo a páginas criadas por outras pessoas, você se torna um participante ativo na world wide web.
O HTML usa "Marcação" para anotar texto, imagem e outros conteúdos para exibição em um navegador da Web. A marcação HTML inclui "elementos" especiais, como <head>, <title>, <body>, <header>, <footer>, <article>, <section>, <p>, <div>, <span>, <img>, <aside>, <audio>, <canvas>, <datalist>, <details>, <embed>, <nav>, <output>, <progress>, <video>, <ul>, <ol>, <li> e muitos outros.
Um elemento HTML é separado de outro texto em um documento por "tags", que consistem no nome do elemento entre "<" e ">". O nome de um elemento dentro de uma tag é insensível a maiúsculas e minúsculas. Isto é, pode ser escrito em maiúsculas, minúsculas ou um mistura. Por exemplo, a tag <title> pode ser escrita como <Title>, <TITLE> ou de qualquer outra forma.

Введение в HTML
Если вы новичок в веб-разработке, обязательно прочитайте нашу статью "Основы HTML", чтобы узнать, что такое HTML и как его использовать.


Руководства по HTML
Статьи о том, как использовать HTML, а также обучающие материалы и исчерпывающие примеры можно найти в разделе "Пространство изучения HTML".


Справка по HTML
В нашем обширном разделе "Справка по HTML" вы найдёте подробности о каждом элементе и атрибуте в HTML.

Руководства для начинающихНаше Пространство изучения HTML содержит множество модулей, которые обучают HTML с нуля — начальные знания не требуются.

Введение в HTML

Этот модуль закладывает основу, знакомя вас с важными понятиями и синтаксисом, такими как применение HTML к тексту, создание гиперссылок и использование HTML для построения веб-страницы.

Мультимедиа и встраивание

В этом модуле рассматривается, как использовать HTML для добавления мультимедиа на ваши веб-страницы, включая различные способы вставки изображений, а также для встраивания видео, аудио, и даже других веб-страниц целиком.

HTML-таблицы

Представление табличных данных на веб-странице в понятной, доступной форме может быть проблемой. Этот модуль охватывает базовую разметку таблиц, а также более сложные особенности, такие как добавление заголовков и описаний.

HTML-формы

Формы являются очень важной частью Веба — они предоставляют большую часть функциональности, необходимого для взаимодействия с веб-сайтами, например регистрация и вход в систему, отправка отзывов, покупка товаров, и многое другое. Этот модуль познакомит вас с созданием клиентских (client-side/front-end) частей форм.

Используйте HTML для решения распространённых задач.

Содержит ссылки на разделы, объясняющие как использовать HTML для решения самых распространённых задач при создании веб-страницы: работа с заголовками, добавление изображений или видео, выделение контента, создание простой формы и т.д.

Продвинутые темы
CORS: включённые изображения

Атрибут crossorigin в сочетании с соответствующим заголовком CORS, позволяет загружать изображения, определённые элементом <img>, из внешних источников и использовать в элементе <canvas>, как если бы они были загружены из текущего источника.

CORS: Настройки атрибутов

Некоторые HTML-элементы, предоставляющие поддержку CORS, такие как <img> или <video>, имеют атрибут crossorigin (свойство crossOrigin), который позволяет вам настраивать CORS-запросы для получаемых элементом данных.

Управление фокусом в HTML

DOM-Атрибут activeElement и DOM-метод hasFocus() помогают отслеживать и контролировать взаимодействие пользователя с элементами на веб-странице.

Предварительная загрузка контента с помощью rel="preload"

Значение preload атрибута rel элемента <link> позволяет писать декларативные fetch-запросы в HTML <head>, указывая ресурсы, которые потребуются вашим страницам сразу после загрузки и, следовательно, которые вы хотите начать предварительно загружать на раннем этапе жизненного цикла страницы, прежде чем браузером запустится основной механизм рендеринга (отрисовки). Это гарантирует, что они станут доступными раньше и с меньшей вероятностью заблокируют первый рендеринг страницы, что приведёт к улучшению производительности. В этой статье приведено начальное руководство по работе с preload (предзагрузкой).

Справочники
Справка по HTML

HTML состоит из элементов, каждый из которых может быть изменён некоторым количеством атрибутов. HTML-документы связаны между собой ссылками.

Справка по HTML-элементам

Просмотр списка всех элементов HTML.

Справка по HTML-атрибутам

У элементов в HTML есть атрибуты. Это дополнительные величины, которые настраивают элементы или управляют их поведением различными способами.

Глобальные атрибуты

Глобальные атрибуты могут быть указаны для всех элементов HTML, даже тех, которые не указаны в стандарте. Это означает, что любые нестандартные элементы обязаны по-прежнему разрешать эти атрибуты, даже если эти элементы делают документ несовместимым с HTML5.

Строчные и блочные элементы

Элементы HTML являются обычно "строчными" или "блочными". Строчный элемент занимает только пространство, ограниченное тегами, которые его определяют. Блочный элемент занимает все пространство своего родительского элемента (контейнера), тем самым создавая "блок".

Типы ссылок

В HTML различные типы ссылок могут использоваться для установления и определения связи между двумя документами. Элементы-ссылки, типы которых могут быть заданы, включают в себя <a>, <area> и <link>.

Поддержка медиа-форматов с помощью HTML-элементов audio и video

Элементы <audio> и <video> позволяют вам воспроизводить аудио и видео. Эти элементы предоставляют браузерную альтернативу аналогичным возможностям, которые есть в Adobe Flash и других плагинах.

Виды HTML-контента

HTML состоит из нескольких видов контента, каждый из которых разрешено использовать в определённых контекстах и запрещено в других. Так же, у каждого есть набор других категорий контента, которые они могут содержать, и элементы, которые могут или не могут использоваться в них. Это руководство по таким категориям.

Значение preload атрибута rel элемента <link> позволяет писать декларативные fetch-запросы в HTML <head>, указывая ресурсы, которые потребуются вашим страницам сразу после загрузки и, следовательно, которые вы хотите начать предварительно загружать на раннем этапе жизненного цикла страницы, прежде чем браузером запустится основной механизм рендеринга (отрисовки). Это гарантирует, что они станут доступными раньше и с меньшей вероятностью заблокируют первый рендеринг страницы, что приведёт к улучшению производительности. В этой статье приведено начальное руководство по работе с preload (предзагрузкой).

Справка по HTML

HTML состоит из элементов, каждый из которых может быть изменён некоторым количеством атрибутов. HTML-документы связаны между собой ссылками.

Справка по HTML-элементам

Справка по HTML-атрибутам

У элементов в HTML есть атрибуты. Это дополнительные величины, которые настраивают элементы или управляют их поведением различными способами.

Глобальные атрибуты

Глобальные атрибуты могут быть указаны для всех элементов HTML, даже тех, которые не указаны в стандарте. Это означает, что любые нестандартные элементы обязаны по-прежнему разрешать эти атрибуты, даже если эти элементы делают документ несовместимым с HTML5.

Строчные и блочные элементы

Элементы HTML являются обычно "строчными" или "блочными". Строчный элемент занимает только пространство, ограниченное тегами, которые его определяют. Блочный элемент занимает все пространство своего родительского элемента (контейнера), тем самым создавая "блок".

Типы ссылок

В HTML различные типы ссылок могут использоваться для установления и определения связи между двумя документами. Элементы-ссылки, типы которых могут быть заданы, включают в себя <a>, <area> и <link>.

Поддержка медиа-форматов с помощью HTML-элементов audio и video

Элементы <audio> и <video> позволяют вам воспроизводить аудио и видео. Эти элементы предоставляют браузерную альтернативу аналогичным возможностям, которые есть в Adobe Flash и других плагинах.

Виды HTML-контента

HTML состоит из нескольких видов контента, каждый из которых разрешено использовать в определённых контекстах и запрещено в других. Так же, у каждого есть набор других категорий контента, которые они могут содержать, и элементы, которые могут или не могут использоваться в них. Это руководство по таким категориям.

Он определяет содержание и структуру веб-контента. Другие технологии, помимо HTML, обычно используются для описания внешнего вида/представления (CSS) или функциональности/поведения (JavaScript) веб-страницы.
Под гипертекстом ("hypertext") понимаются ссылки, которые соединяют веб-страницы друг с другом либо в пределах одного веб-сайта, либо между веб-сайтами. Ссылки являются фундаментальным аспектом Веба. Загружая контент в Интернет и связывая его со страницами, созданными другими людьми, вы становитесь активным участником Всемирной паутины.
HTML использует разметку ("markup") для отображения текста, изображений и другого контента в веб-браузере. HTML-разметка включает в себя специальные "элементы", такие как <head>, <title>, <body>, <header>, <footer>, <article>, <section>, <p>, <div>, <span>, <img>, <aside>, <audio>, <canvas>, <datalist>, <details>, <embed>, <nav>, <output>, <progress>, <video> и многие другие.
HTML-элемент выделяется из прочего текста в документе с помощью "тегов", которые состоят из имени элемента окружённого "<" и ">". Имя элемента внутри тега не чувствительно к регистру. То есть, оно может быть написано в верхнем или нижнем регистре, или смешано. Например, тег <title> может быть записан как <Title>, <TITLE>, или любым другим способом.
Статьи, представленные ниже, могут помочь вам больше узнать о HTML.


Введение в HTML
Если вы новичок в веб-разработке, обязательно прочитайте нашу статью "Основы HTML", чтобы узнать, что такое HTML и как его использовать.

Статьи о том, как использовать HTML, а также обучающие материалы и исчерпывающие примеры можно найти в разделе "Пространство изучения HTML".


Справка по HTML
В нашем обширном разделе "Справка по HTML" вы найдёте подробности о каждом элементе и атрибуте в HTML.

Руководства для начинающихНаше Пространство изучения HTML содержит множество модулей, которые обучают HTML с нуля — начальные знания не требуются.

Введение в HTML

Этот модуль закладывает основу, знакомя вас с важными понятиями и синтаксисом, такими как применение HTML к тексту, создание гиперссылок и использование HTML для построения веб-страницы.

Мультимедиа и встраивание

В этом модуле рассматривается, как использовать HTML для добавления мультимедиа на ваши веб-страницы, включая различные способы вставки изображений, а также для встраивания видео, аудио, и даже других веб-страниц целиком.

HTML-таблицы

Представление табличных данных на веб-странице в понятной, доступной форме может быть проблемой. Этот модуль охватывает базовую разметку таблиц, а также более сложные особенности, такие как добавление заголовков и описаний.

HTML-формы

Формы являются очень важной частью Веба — они предоставляют большую часть функциональности, необходимого для взаимодействия с веб-сайтами, например регистрация и вход в систему, отправка отзывов, покупка товаров, и многое другое. Этот модуль познакомит вас с созданием клиентских (client-side/front-end) частей форм.

Используйте HTML для решения распространённых задач.

Содержит ссылки на разделы, объясняющие как использовать HTML для решения самых распространённых задач при создании веб-страницы: работа с заголовками, добавление изображений или видео, выделение контента, создание простой формы и т.д.

Продвинутые темы
CORS: включённые изображения

Атрибут crossorigin в сочетании с соответствующим заголовком CORS, позволяет загружать изображения, определённые элементом <img>, из внешних источников и использовать в элементе <canvas>, как если бы они были загружены из текущего источника.

CORS: Настройки атрибутов

Некоторые HTML-элементы, предоставляющие поддержку CORS, такие как <img> или <video>, имеют атрибут crossorigin (свойство crossOrigin), который позволяет вам настраивать CORS-запросы для получаемых элементом данных.

Управление фокусом в HTML

DOM-Атрибут activeElement и DOM-метод hasFocus() помогают отслеживать и контролировать взаимодействие пользователя с элементами на веб-странице.

Предварительная загрузка контента с помощью rel="preload"

Значение preload атрибута rel элемента <link> позволяет писать декларативные fetch-запросы в HTML <head>, указывая ресурсы, которые потребуются вашим страницам сразу после загрузки и, следовательно, которые вы хотите начать предварительно загружать на раннем этапе жизненного цикла страницы, прежде чем браузером запустится основной механизм рендеринга (отрисовки).

CORS 处理跨域图片

通过搭配 crossorigin 属性和适当的 CORS 标头，在 <img> 元素中定义的图片可以从外部来源加载并在 <canvas> 元素中使用，就像是从本地源加载一样。

CORS 设置属性

一些提供了对 CORS 的支持的 HTML 元素，比如 <img> 或 <video>，具有 crossorigin 元素属性／attribute（crossOrigin 对象属性／property），该属性能使你配置其跨域获取资源的请求。

使用 rel="preload" 预加载页面内容

<link> 元素的 rel 属性的值 preload 允许你在 HTML 的 <head> 部分声明一些（资源）获取请求，以指定那些在页面加载后即刻需要的资源。因此在浏览器的主渲染机制介入前，这些资源会在页面加载生命周期的早期阶段进行预加载。这样可以保证这些资源可被更早使用并减少阻塞页面初次渲染的可能性，从而提升性能。这篇文章提供了关于 preload 作用机制的基本指导。

「超文本」（HyperText）指的是將 Web 相互連接的連結，可以在單個網站內部或網站之間進行連接。連結是 Web 的基本方面。通過將內容上傳到互聯網並將其連接到其他人創建的頁面，你成為了全球資訊網的積極參與者。
HTML 使用「標記」（Markup）來詮釋文本、圖像和其他內容，以便在 Web 瀏覽器中顯示。HTML 標記包括特殊的「元素」，例如 <head>、<title>、<body>、<header>、<footer>、<article>、<section>、<p>、<div>、<span>、<img>、<aside>、<audio>、<canvas>、<datalist>、<details>、<embed>、<nav>、<search>、<output>、<progress>、<video>、<ul>、<ol>、<li> 等等。
HTML 元素通過「標籤」與文件中的其他文本區分開來，標籤由元素名稱和 < 及 > 組成。標籤內的元素名稱不區分大小寫。也就是說，它可以用大寫、小寫或混合寫法。例如，<title> 標籤可以寫成 <Title>、<TITLE> 或其他任何方式。然而，慣例和推薦的做法是將標籤寫成小寫。
以下文章可以幫助你進一步了解 HTML。初學者教程
你的第一個網站：創建內容

這篇文章提供了一個簡短的 HTML 簡介和使用方法，適合完全新手的 Web 開發者。

使用 HTML 建構內容

我們的學習 Web 開發章節的 HTML 模塊從頭開始教授所有 HTML 基礎知識。

指南
HTML 表單

表單是 Web 非常重要的一章節——它們提供了與網站互動所需的大章節功能，例如註冊和登錄、發送反饋、購買產品等。此模塊將幫助你開始創建表單的用戶端/前端部分。

啟用 CORS 的圖像

crossorigin 屬性與適當的 CORS 標頭結合使用，允許由 <img> 元素定義的圖像從外部來源加載，並在 <canvas> 元素中使用，就像它們是從當前來源加載的一樣。

CORS 設定屬性

一些支援 CORS 的 HTML 元素，例如 <img> 或 <video>，具有 crossorigin 屬性（crossOrigin 屬性），允許你配置元素提取數據的 CORS 請求。

使用 rel="preload" 預加載內容

<link> 元素的 rel 屬性的 preload 值允許你在 HTML <head> 中編寫聲明式提取請求，指定頁面加載後不久將需要的資源，因此你希望在頁面加載生命週期的早期開始預加載它們，這樣可以確保它們更早可用，並且不太可能阻塞頁面的首次渲染，從而提高性能。這篇文章提供了 preload 的基本指南。

響應式圖像

在這篇文章中，我們將學習響應式圖像的概念——在具有不同螢幕尺寸、分辨率和其他特徵的設備上良好顯示的圖像——並查看 HTML 提供的幫助實現它們的工具。這有助於提高不同設備上的性能。

參考
HTML 參考

HTML 由元素組成，每個元素都可以由若干屬性修飾。HTML 文件通過連結相互連接。

HTML 元素參考

瀏覽所有 HTML 元素的列表。

HTML 屬性參考

HTML 中的元素具有屬性。這些屬性是配置元素或以各種方式調整其行為的附加值。

全域屬性

全域屬性可以在所有 HTML 元素上指定，即使那些未在標準中指定的元素。這意味著任何非標準元素仍然必須允許這些屬性，即使這些元素使文件不符合 HTML5 標準。

內聯級元素和區塊級元素

HTML 元素通常是「內聯級」或「區塊級」元素。內聯級元素僅佔據由定義它的標籤界定的空間。區塊級元素佔據其父元素（容器）的整個空間，從而創建一個「區塊框」。

HTML 註釋

HTML 註釋用於向標記添加說明性註釋或防止瀏覽器解釋文件的特定部分。

Web 上的媒體類型和格式指南

<audio> 和 <video> 元素允許你在內容中本地播放音訊和視訊媒體，而無需外部軟體支援。

HTML 內容類型

HTML 由幾種內容組成，每種內容允許在某些上下文中使用，而在其他上下文中不允許使用。同樣，每個上下文都有一組它可以包含的其他內容類型以及可以或不能在其中使用的元素。這是這些類型的指南。

怪異模式和標準模式

這篇文章涵蓋了使用 CSS 為 HTML 內容添加顏色的的大部分方法，列出了 HTML 文件的哪些部分可以著色以及在進行著色時應使用哪些 CSS 屬性。\n\nHTML：超文本標記語言HTML（HyperText Markup Language，超文本標記語言）是 Web 最基本的構建塊。它定義了 Web 內容的意義和結構。除了 HTML 之外，通常還會使用其他技術來描述 Web 的外觀／呈現（CSS）或功能／行為（JavaScript）。
「超文本」（HyperText）指的是將 Web 相互連接的連結，可以在單個網站內部或網站之間進行連接。連結是 Web 的基本方面。通過將內容上傳到互聯網並將其連接到其他人創建的頁面，你成為了全球資訊網的積極參與者。
HTML 使用「標記」（Markup）來詮釋文本、圖像和其他內容，以便在 Web 瀏覽器中顯示。HTML 標記包括特殊的「元素」，例如 <head>、<title>、<body>、<header>、<footer>、<article>、<section>、<p>、<div>、<span>、<img>、<aside>、<audio>、<canvas>、<datalist>、<details>、<embed>、<nav>、<search>、<output>、<progress>、<video>、<ul>、<ol>、<li> 等等。
HTML 元素通過「標籤」與文件中的其他文本區分開來，標籤由元素名稱和 < 及 > 組成。標籤內的元素名稱不區分大小寫。也就是說，它可以用大寫、小寫或混合寫法。例如，<title> 標籤可以寫成 <Title>、<TITLE> 或其他任何方式。然而，慣例和推薦的做法是將標籤寫成小寫。
以下文章可以幫助你進一步了解 HTML。初學者教程
你的第一個網站：創建內容

這篇文章提供了一個簡短的 HTML 簡介和使用方法，適合完全新手的 Web 開發者。

使用 HTML 建構內容

我們的學習 Web 開發章節的 HTML 模塊從頭開始教授所有 HTML 基礎知識。

指南
HTML 表單

表單是 Web 非常重要的一章節——它們提供了與網站互動所需的大章節功能，例如註冊和登錄、發送反饋、購買產品等。此模塊將幫助你開始創建表單的用戶端/前端部分。

啟用 CORS 的圖像

crossorigin 屬性與適當的 CORS 標頭結合使用，允許由 <img> 元素定義的圖像從外部來源加載，並在 <canvas> 元素中使用，就像它們是從當前來源加載的一樣。

CORS 設定屬性

一些支援 CORS 的 HTML 元素，例如 <img> 或 <video>，具有 crossorigin 屬性（crossOrigin 屬性），允許你配置元素提取數據的 CORS 請求。

使用 rel="preload" 預加載內容

<link> 元素的 rel 屬性的 preload 值允許你在 HTML <head> 中編寫聲明式提取請求，指定頁面加載後不久將需要的資源，因此你希望在頁面加載生命週期的早期開始預加載它們，這樣可以確保它們更早可用，並且不太可能阻塞頁面的首次渲染，從而提高性能。這篇文章提供了 preload 的基本指南。

響應式圖像

在這篇文章中，我們將學習響應式圖像的概念——在具有不同螢幕尺寸、分辨率和其他特徵的設備上良好顯示的圖像——並查看 HTML 提供的幫助實現它們的工具。這有助於提高不同設備上的性能。

參考
HTML 參考

HTML 由元素組成，每個元素都可以由若干屬性修飾。HTML 文件通過連結相互連接。

HTML 元素參考

瀏覽所有 HTML 元素的列表。

HTML 屬性參考

HTML 中的元素具有屬性。這些屬性是配置元素或以各種方式調整其行為的附加值。

全域屬性

全域屬性可以在所有 HTML 元素上指定，即使那些未在標準中指定的元素。這意味著任何非標準元素仍然必須允許這些屬性，即使這些元素使文件不符合 HTML5 標準。

內聯級元素和區塊級元素

HTML 元素通常是「內聯級」或「區塊級」元素。內聯級元素僅佔據由定義它的標籤界定的空間。區塊級元素佔據其父元素（容器）的整個空間，從而創建一個「區塊框」。

HTML 註釋

HTML 註釋用於向標記添加說明性註釋或防止瀏覽器解釋文件的特定部分。

Web 上的媒體類型和格式指南

<audio> 和 <video> 元素允許你在內容中本地播放音訊和視訊媒體，而無需外部軟體支援。

HTML 內容類型

HTML 由幾種內容組成，每種內容允許在某些上下文中使用，而在其他上下文中不允許使用。同樣，每個上下文都有一組它可以包含的其他內容類型以及可以或不能在其中使用的元素。這是這些類型的指南。

怪異模式和標準模式

關於怪異模式和標準模式的歷史訊息。

The articles below can help you learn more about HTML.Beginner's tutorials
Your first website: Creating the content

This article provides a brief tour of what HTML is and how to use it, aimed at people who are completely new to web development.

Structuring content with HTML

Our Learn web development section's HTML module teaches all the HTML fundamentals from the ground up.

Guides
HTML forms

Forms are a very important part of the Web — these provide much of the functionality you need for interacting with websites, e.g., registering and logging in, sending feedback, buying products, and more. This module gets you started with creating the client-side/front-end parts of forms.

CORS enabled image

The crossorigin attribute, in combination with an appropriate CORS header, allows images defined by the <img> element to be loaded from foreign origins and used in a <canvas> element as if they were being loaded from the current origin.

CORS settings attributes

Some HTML elements that provide support for CORS, such as <img> or <video>, have a crossorigin attribute (crossOrigin property), which lets you configure the CORS requests for the element's fetched data.

Preloading content with rel="preload"

The preload value of the <link> element's rel attribute allows you to write declarative fetch requests in your HTML <head>, specifying resources that your pages will need very soon after loading, which you therefore want to start preloading early in the lifecycle of a page load, before the browser's main rendering machinery kicks in. This ensures that they are made available earlier and are less likely to block the page's first render, leading to performance improvements. This article provides a basic guide to how preload works.

Responsive images

In this article, we'll learn about the concept of responsive images — images that work well on devices with widely differing screen sizes, resolutions, and other such features — and look at what tools HTML provides to help implement them. This helps to improve performance across different devices.

Reference
HTML reference

HTML consists of elements, each of which may be modified by some number of attributes. HTML documents are connected to each other with links.

HTML element reference

Browse a list of all HTML elements.

HTML attribute reference

Elements in HTML have attributes. These are additional values that configure the elements or adjust their behavior in various ways.

Global attributes

Global attributes may be specified on all HTML elements, even those not specified in the standard. This means that any non-standard elements must still permit these attributes, even though those elements make the document HTML5-noncompliant.

Inline-level elements and block-level elements

HTML elements are usually "inline-level" or "block-level" elements. An inline-level element occupies only the space bounded by the tags that define it. A block-level element occupies the entire space of its parent element (container), thereby creating a "block box".

HTML comments

HTML comments are used to add explanatory notes to the markup or to prevent the browser from interpreting specific parts of the document.

Guide to media types and formats on the web

The <audio> and <video> elements allow you to play audio and video media natively within your content without the need for external software support.

HTML content categories

HTML is comprised of several kinds of content, each of which is allowed to be used in certain contexts and is disallowed in others. Similarly, each context has a set of other content categories it can contain and elements that can or can't be used in them. This is a guide to these categories.

Quirks mode and standards mode

This ensures that they are made available earlier and are less likely to block the page's first render, leading to performance improvements. This article provides a basic guide to how preload works.

Responsive images

In this article, we'll learn about the concept of responsive images — images that work well on devices with widely differing screen sizes, resolutions, and other such features — and look at what tools HTML provides to help implement them. This helps to improve performance across different devices.

Reference
HTML reference

HTML consists of elements, each of which may be modified by some number of attributes. HTML documents are connected to each other with links.

HTML element reference

Browse a list of all HTML elements.

HTML attribute reference

Elements in HTML have attributes. These are additional values that configure the elements or adjust their behavior in various ways.

Global attributes

Global attributes may be specified on all HTML elements, even those not specified in the standard. This means that any non-standard elements must still permit these attributes, even though those elements make the document HTML5-noncompliant.

Inline-level elements and block-level elements

HTML elements are usually "inline-level" or "block-level" elements. An inline-level element occupies only the space bounded by the tags that define it. A block-level element occupies the entire space of its parent element (container), thereby creating a "block box".

HTML comments

HTML comments are used to add explanatory notes to the markup or to prevent the browser from interpreting specific parts of the document.

Guide to media types and formats on the web

The <audio> and <video> elements allow you to play audio and video media natively within your content without the need for external software support.

HTML content categories

HTML is comprised of several kinds of content, each of which is allowed to be used in certain contexts and is disallowed in others. Similarly, each context has a set of other content categories it can contain and elements that can or can't be used in them. This is a guide to these categories.

It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).
"Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.
HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special "elements" such as <head>, <title>, <body>, <header>, <footer>, <article>, <section>, <p>, <div>, <span>, <img>, <aside>, <audio>, <canvas>, <datalist>, <details>, <embed>, <nav>, <search>, <output>, <progress>, <video>, <ul>, <ol>, <li> and many others.
An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which consist of the element name surrounded by < and >. The name of an element inside a tag is case-insensitive. That is, it can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the <title> tag can be written as <Title>, <TITLE>, or in any other way. However, the convention and recommended practice is to write tags in lowercase.

Your first website: Creating the content

This article provides a brief tour of what HTML is and how to use it, aimed at people who are completely new to web development.

Structuring content with HTML

Our Learn web development section's HTML module teaches all the HTML fundamentals from the ground up.

Guides
HTML forms

Forms are a very important part of the Web — these provide much of the functionality you need for interacting with websites, e.g., registering and logging in, sending feedback, buying products, and more. This module gets you started with creating the client-side/front-end parts of forms.

CORS enabled image

The crossorigin attribute, in combination with an appropriate CORS header, allows images defined by the <img> element to be loaded from foreign origins and used in a <canvas> element as if they were being loaded from the current origin.

CORS settings attributes

Some HTML elements that provide support for CORS, such as <img> or <video>, have a crossorigin attribute (crossOrigin property), which lets you configure the CORS requests for the element's fetched data.

Preloading content with rel="preload"

The preload value of the <link> element's rel attribute allows you to write declarative fetch requests in your HTML <head>, specifying resources that your pages will need very soon after loading, which you therefore want to start preloading early in the lifecycle of a page load, before the browser's main rendering machinery kicks in.

HTML markup includes special "elements" such as <head>, <title>, <body>, <header>, <footer>, <article>, <section>, <p>, <div>, <span>, <img>, <aside>, <audio>, <canvas>, <datalist>, <details>, <embed>, <nav>, <search>, <output>, <progress>, <video>, <ul>, <ol>, <li> and many others.
An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which consist of the element name surrounded by < and >. The name of an element inside a tag is case-insensitive. That is, it can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the <title> tag can be written as <Title>, <TITLE>, or in any other way. However, the convention and recommended practice is to write tags in lowercase.

Your first website: Creating the content

This article provides a brief tour of what HTML is and how to use it, aimed at people who are completely new to web development.

Structuring content with HTML

Our Learn web development section's HTML module teaches all the HTML fundamentals from the ground up.

Guides
HTML forms

Forms are a very important part of the Web — these provide much of the functionality you need for interacting with websites, e.g., registering and logging in, sending feedback, buying products, and more. This module gets you started with creating the client-side/front-end parts of forms.

CORS enabled image

The crossorigin attribute, in combination with an appropriate CORS header, allows images defined by the <img> element to be loaded from foreign origins and used in a <canvas> element as if they were being loaded from the current origin.

CORS settings attributes

Some HTML elements that provide support for CORS, such as <img> or <video>, have a crossorigin attribute (crossOrigin property), which lets you configure the CORS requests for the element's fetched data.

Preloading content with rel="preload"

The preload value of the <link> element's rel attribute allows you to write declarative fetch requests in your HTML <head>, specifying resources that your pages will need very soon after loading, which you therefore want to start preloading early in the lifecycle of a page load, before the browser's main rendering machinery kicks in. This ensures that they are made available earlier and are less likely to block the page's first render, leading to performance improvements. This article provides a basic guide to how preload works.

Responsive images

In this article, we'll learn about the concept of responsive images — images that work well on devices with widely differing screen sizes, resolutions, and other such features — and look at what tools HTML provides to help implement them. This helps to improve performance across different devices.

Reference
HTML reference

HTML consists of elements, each of which may be modified by some number of attributes. HTML documents are connected to each other with links.

HTML element reference

Browse a list of all HTML elements.

HTML attribute reference

Elements in HTML have attributes. These are additional values that configure the elements or adjust their behavior in various ways.

Global attributes

Global attributes may be specified on all HTML elements, even those not specified in the standard. This means that any non-standard elements must still permit these attributes, even though those elements make the document HTML5-noncompliant.

Inline-level elements and block-level elements

HTML elements are usually "inline-level" or "block-level" elements. An inline-level element occupies only the space bounded by the tags that define it. A block-level element occupies the entire space of its parent element (container), thereby creating a "block box".

HTML comments

HTML comments are used to add explanatory notes to the markup or to prevent the browser from interpreting specific parts of the document.

Guide to media types and formats on the web

The <audio> and <video> elements allow you to play audio and video media natively within your content without the need for external software support.

HTML content categories

HTML is comprised of several kinds of content, each of which is allowed to be used in certain contexts and is disallowed in others. Similarly, each context has a set of other content categories it can contain and elements that can or can't be used in them. This is a guide to these categories.

Quirks mode and standards mode

Content categoriesMost HTML elements are a member of one or more content categories — these categories group elements that share common characteristics. This is a loose grouping (it doesn't actually create a relationship among elements of these categories), but they help define and describe the categories' shared behavior and their associated rules. It's possible for elements (such as track) to not be a member of any of these categories.HTML cheatsheet for syntax and common tasksWhile using HTML it can be very handy to have an easy way to remember how to use HTML tags properly and how to apply them. MDN provides you with extended HTML reference documentation as well as a deep instructional set of HTML guides. However, in many cases we just need some quick hints as we go. That's the whole purpose of the cheat sheet, to give you some quick accurate ready to use code snippets for common usages.Understanding quirks and standards modesIn the old days of the web, pages were typically written in two versions: One for Netscape Navigator, and one for Microsoft Internet Explorer. When the web standards were made at W3C, browsers could not just start using them, as doing so would break most existing sites on the web. Browsers therefore introduced two modes to treat new standards compliant sites differently from old legacy sites.Using date and time formats in HTMLCertain HTML elements use date and/or time values. The formats of the strings that specify these values are described in this article.Using HTML comments An HTML comment is used to add explanatory notes to the markup or to prevent the browser from interpreting specific parts of the document.Using HTML form validation and the Constraint Validation APIThe creation of web forms has always been a complex task. While marking up the form itself is easy, checking whether each field has a valid and coherent value is more difficult, and informing the user about the problem may become a headache. HTML5 introduced new mechanisms for forms: it added new semantic types for the input element and constraint validation to ease the work of checking the form content on the client side. Basic, usual constraints can be checked, without the need for JavaScript, by setting new attributes; more complex constraints can be tested using the Constraint Validation API.Using microdata in HTMLMicrodata is part of the WHATWG HTML Standard and is used to nest metadata within existing content on web pages. Search engines and web crawlers can extract and process microdata from a web page and use it to provide a richer browsing experience for users. Search engines benefit greatly from direct access to this structured data because it allows search engines to understand the information on web pages and provide more relevant results to users. Microdata uses a supporting vocabulary to describe an item and name-value pairs to assign values to its properties. Microdata is an attempt to provide a declarative way of annotating HTML elements with machine-readable tags than the similar approaches of using RDFa and classic microformats.Using microformats in HTMLMicroformats are standards used to embed semantics and structured data in HTML, and provide an API to be used by social web applications, search engines, aggregators, and other tools. These minimal patterns of HTML are used for marking up entities that range from fundamental to domain-specific information, such as people, organizations, events, and locations.Using responsive images in HTMLIn this article, we'll learn about the concept of responsive images — images that work well on devices with widely differing screen sizes, resolutions, and other such features — and look at what tools HTML provides to help implement them.

This is a loose grouping (it doesn't actually create a relationship among elements of these categories), but they help define and describe the categories' shared behavior and their associated rules. It's possible for elements (such as <track>) to not be a member of any of these categories.
The content categories are used to define the content model of elements, in other words what each element can take as descendants. For example, a <p> element can only contain phrasing content, while a <div> element can contain flow content.
There are seven main content categories, which can be summarized with the Venn diagram below:


Note:
A more detailed discussion of these content categories and their comparative functionalities is beyond the scope of this article; for that, you may wish to read the relevant portions of the HTML specification.
Metadata contentElements belonging to the metadata content category modify the presentation or the behavior of the rest of the document, set up links to other documents, or convey other out-of-band information. Everything in the <head>, including the <title>, <link>, <script>, <style>, and the lesser used <base>, is metadata content. There is a <meta> element for metadata that cannot be represented by these other elements.
The metadata elements are:

<base>
<link>
<meta>
<noscript>
<script>
<style>
<template>
<title>

Some of these elements belong to more than one content category. For example, <script> is a member of the metadata, flow, and phrasing content categories, and is a script-supporting element; <script> can be used where metadata content, phrasing content, or script-supporting elements are expected.Flow contentFlow content is a broad category that encompasses most elements that can go inside the <body> element, including heading elements, sectioning elements, phrasing elements, embedding elements, interactive elements, and form-related elements. It also includes text nodes (but not those that only consist of white space characters).
The flow elements are:

<a>
<abbr>
<address>
<article>
<aside>
<audio>

<bdi>
<bdo>

Plain text

A few other elements belong to this category, but only if a specific condition is fulfilled:

<area>, if it is a descendant of a <map> element
<link>, if the itemprop attribute is present
<meta>, if the itemprop attribute is present
Sectioning contentSectioning content, a subset of flow content, creates a section in the current outline defining the scope of <header> and <footer> elements.
The sectioning elements are:

<article>
<aside>
<nav>
<section>
Heading contentHeading content, a subset of flow content, defines the title of a section. This definition applies both to sections marked by an explicit sectioning content elements and to those implicitly defined by the heading content itself.
The heading elements are:

<h1>-<h6>
<hgroup>


Note:
Though likely to contain heading content, the <header> is not heading content itself.
Phrasing contentPhrasing content, a subset of flow content, refers to the text and the markup within a document. Sequences of phrasing content make up paragraphs.
The phrasing elements are:

<abbr>
<audio>

Embedded contentEmbedded content, a subset of flow content, imports another resource or inserts content from another markup language or namespace into the document.
The embedded content elements are:

<audio>
<canvas>
<embed>
<iframe>
<img>
<math>
<object>
<picture>
<svg>
<video>
Interactive contentInteractive content, a subset of flow content, includes elements that are specifically designed for user interaction.
The interactive content elements are:

<button>
<details>
<embed>
<iframe>
<label>
<select>
<textarea>

Some elements belong to this category only under specific conditions:

<a>, if the href attribute is present
<audio>, if the controls attribute is present
<img>, if the usemap attribute is present
<input>, if the type attribute is not in the hidden state
<object>, if the usemap attribute is present
<video>, if the controls attribute is present
Palpable contentPalpable content is content that is neither empty nor hidden; it is content that is rendered and substantive. Palpable content is not used to define content models but is used to define a general rule: Elements whose content model allows any flow content or phrasing content should have at least one node in its contents that is palpable content and that does not have the hidden attribute specified.
The palpable elements are:

<a>
<abbr>
<address>
<article>

Some elements belong to this category only under specific conditions:

<audio>, if the controls attribute is present
<dl>, if the element's children include at least one name-value group
<input>, if the type attribute is not in the hidden state
<ol>, if it's children include at least one <li> element
<ul>, if it's children include at least one <li> element
Script-supporting elementsScript-supporting elements are elements that don't directly contribute to a document's rendered output. Instead, they serve to support scripts, either by containing or specifying script code directly or by specifying data that will be used by scripts. Nearly all elements, including those that only take specific elements (such as <ul>, which takes <li> elements), can contain script-supporting elements.
The script-supporting elements are:

<script>
<template>
Form-associated contentForm-associated content is a subset of flow content comprising elements that have a form owner and can be used everywhere flow content is expected. A form owner is either the containing <form> element or the <form> whose id is specified in the element's form attribute.
The form-associated elements are:

<button>
<fieldset>
<input>
<object>
<output>
<select>
<textarea>
<img>

This category contains several sub-categories:

listed

Elements that are listed in the HTMLFormElement.elements and HTMLFieldSetElement.elements collections. Includes <button>, <fieldset>, <input>, <object>, <output>, <select>, and <textarea>.

submittable

Elements that can be used for constructing the form data set when the form is submitted. Includes <button>, <input>, <select>, and <textarea>.

resettable

Elements that can be affected when a form is reset. Includes <input>, <output>, <select>, and <textarea>.

autocapitalize-and-autocorrect-inheriting

Elements that inherit the autocapitalize and autocorrect attributes from their form owner. Includes <button>, <fieldset>, <input>, <output>, <select>, and <textarea>.

labelable

Elements that can be associated with <label> elements. Includes <button>, <input> (all types other than hidden), <meter>, <output>, <progress>, <select>, and <textarea>.

Transparent content modelIf an element has a transparent content model, then its contents must be structured such that they would be valid HTML, even if the transparent element were removed and replaced by the child elements.
For example, the <del> and <ins> elements are transparent:
html<p><del>Shopping</del> <ins>Returns</ins> list</p>
<ul>
  <del>
    <li>Oranges</li>
    <li>Toilet paper</li>
  </del>
  <li>Toothpaste</li>
</ul>

If those elements were removed, this fragment would still be valid HTML (if not correct English).
html<p>Shopping Returns list</p>
<ul>
  <li>Oranges</li>
  <li>Toilet paper</li>
  <li>Toothpaste</li>
</ul>\n\nContent categoriesMost HTML elements are a member of one or more content categories — these categories group elements that share common characteristics. This is a loose grouping (it doesn't actually create a relationship among elements of these categories), but they help define and describe the categories' shared behavior and their associated rules. It's possible for elements (such as <track>) to not be a member of any of these categories.

Palpable content is not used to define content models but is used to define a general rule: Elements whose content model allows any flow content or phrasing content should have at least one node in its contents that is palpable content and that does not have the hidden attribute specified.
The palpable elements are:

Autonomous custom elements
Plain text that is not inter-element whitespace

Some elements belong to this category only under specific conditions:

<audio>, if the controls attribute is present
<dl>, if the element's children include at least one name-value group
<input>, if the type attribute is not in the hidden state
<ol>, if it's children include at least one <li> element
<ul>, if it's children include at least one <li> element
Script-supporting elementsScript-supporting elements are elements that don't directly contribute to a document's rendered output. Instead, they serve to support scripts, either by containing or specifying script code directly or by specifying data that will be used by scripts. Nearly all elements, including those that only take specific elements (such as <ul>, which takes <li> elements), can contain script-supporting elements.
The script-supporting elements are:

<script>
<template>
Form-associated contentForm-associated content is a subset of flow content comprising elements that have a form owner and can be used everywhere flow content is expected. A form owner is either the containing <form> element or the <form> whose id is specified in the element's form attribute.
The form-associated elements are:

<button>
<fieldset>
<input>
<object>
<output>
<select>
<textarea>
<img>

This category contains several sub-categories:

listed

Elements that are listed in the HTMLFormElement.elements and HTMLFieldSetElement.elements collections. Includes <button>, <fieldset>, <input>, <object>, <output>, <select>, and <textarea>.

submittable

Elements that can be used for constructing the form data set when the form is submitted. Includes <button>, <input>, <select>, and <textarea>.

resettable

Elements that can be affected when a form is reset. Includes <input>, <output>, <select>, and <textarea>.

autocapitalize-and-autocorrect-inheriting

Elements that inherit the autocapitalize and autocorrect attributes from their form owner. Includes <button>, <fieldset>, <input>, <output>, <select>, and <textarea>.

labelable

Elements that can be associated with <label> elements. Includes <button>, <input> (all types other than hidden), <meter>, <output>, <progress>, <select>, and <textarea>.

Transparent content modelIf an element has a transparent content model, then its contents must be structured such that they would be valid HTML, even if the transparent element were removed and replaced by the child elements.
For example, the <del> and <ins> elements are transparent:
html<p><del>Shopping</del> <ins>Returns</ins> list</p>
<ul>
  <del>
    <li>Oranges</li>
    <li>Toilet paper</li>
  </del>
  <li>Toothpaste</li>
</ul>

If those elements were removed, this fragment would still be valid HTML (if not correct English).
html<p>Shopping Returns list</p>
<ul>
  <li>Oranges</li>
  <li>Toilet paper</li>
  <li>Toothpaste</li>
</ul>

This is a loose grouping (it doesn't actually create a relationship among elements of these categories), but they help define and describe the categories' shared behavior and their associated rules. It's possible for elements (such as <track>) to not be a member of any of these categories.
The content categories are used to define the content model of elements, in other words what each element can take as descendants. For example, a <p> element can only contain phrasing content, while a <div> element can contain flow content.
There are seven main content categories, which can be summarized with the Venn diagram below:


Note:
A more detailed discussion of these content categories and their comparative functionalities is beyond the scope of this article; for that, you may wish to read the relevant portions of the HTML specification.
Metadata contentElements belonging to the metadata content category modify the presentation or the behavior of the rest of the document, set up links to other documents, or convey other out-of-band information. Everything in the <head>, including the <title>, <link>, <script>, <style>, and the lesser used <base>, is metadata content. There is a <meta> element for metadata that cannot be represented by these other elements.
The metadata elements are:

<base>
<link>
<meta>
<noscript>
<script>
<style>
<template>
<title>

Some of these elements belong to more than one content category. For example, <script> is a member of the metadata, flow, and phrasing content categories, and is a script-supporting element; <script> can be used where metadata content, phrasing content, or script-supporting elements are expected.Flow contentFlow content is a broad category that encompasses most elements that can go inside the <body> element, including heading elements, sectioning elements, phrasing elements, embedding elements, interactive elements, and form-related elements. It also includes text nodes (but not those that only consist of white space characters).
The flow elements are:

<a>

A few other elements belong to this category, but only if a specific condition is fulfilled:

<area>, if it is a descendant of a <map> element
<link>, if the itemprop attribute is present
<meta>, if the itemprop attribute is present
Sectioning contentSectioning content, a subset of flow content, creates a section in the current outline defining the scope of <header> and <footer> elements.
The sectioning elements are:

<article>
<aside>
<nav>
<section>
Heading contentHeading content, a subset of flow content, defines the title of a section. This definition applies both to sections marked by an explicit sectioning content elements and to those implicitly defined by the heading content itself.
The heading elements are:

<h1>-<h6>
<hgroup>


Note:
Though likely to contain heading content, the <header> is not heading content itself.
Phrasing contentPhrasing content, a subset of flow content, refers to the text and the markup within a document. Sequences of phrasing content make up paragraphs.
The phrasing elements are:

The formats of the strings that specify these values are described in this article.
Elements that use such formats include certain forms of the <input> element that let the user choose or specify a date, time, or both, as well as the <ins> and <del> elements, whose datetime attribute specifies the date or date and time at which the insertion or deletion of content occurred.
For <input>, the type values of inputs whose value contains a string representing a date and/or time are:

date
datetime-local
month
time
week
ExamplesBefore getting into the intricacies of how date and time strings are written and parsed in HTML, here are some examples that should give you a good idea what the more commonly-used date and time string formats look like.

BasicsBefore looking at the various formats of date and time related strings used by HTML elements, it is helpful to understand a few fundamental facts about the way they're defined. HTML uses a variation of the ISO 8601 standard for its date and time strings. It's worth reviewing the descriptions of the formats you're using in order to ensure that your strings are in fact compatible with HTML, as the HTML specification includes algorithms for parsing these strings that is actually more precise than ISO 8601, so there can be subtle differences in how date and time strings are expected to look.Character setDates and times in HTML are always strings which use the ASCII character set.Year numbersIn order to simplify the basic format used for date strings in HTML, the specification requires that all years be given using the modern (or proleptic) Gregorian calendar. While user interfaces may allow entry of dates using other calendars, the underlying value always uses the Gregorian calendar.
While the Gregorian calendar wasn't created until the year 1582 (replacing the similar Julian calendar), for HTML's purposes, the Gregorian calendar is extended back to the year 1 C.E. Make sure any older dates account for this.
For the purposes of HTML dates, years are always at least four digits long; years prior to the year 1000 are padded with leading zeroes (0), so the year 72 is written as 0072. Years prior to the year 1 C.E. are not supported, so HTML doesn't support years 1 B.C.E. (1 B.C.) or earlier.
A year is normally 365 days long, except during leap years.
Leap years
A leap year is any year which is divisible by 400 or the year is divisible by 4 but not by 100. Although the calendar year is normally 365 days long, it actually takes the planet Earth approximately 365.2422 days to complete a single orbit around the sun. Leap years help to adjust the calendar to keep it synchronized with the actual position of the planet in its orbit. Adding a day to the year every four years essentially makes the average year 365.25 days long, which is close to correct.
The adjustments to the algorithm (taking a leap year when the year can be divided by 400, and skipping leap years when the year is divisible by 100) help to bring the average even closer to the correct number of days (365.2425 days). Scientists occasionally add leap seconds to the calendar (seriously) to handle the remaining three ten-thousandths of a day and to compensate for the gradual, naturally occurring slowing of Earth's rotation.
While month 02, February, normally has 28 days, it has 29 days in leap years.Months of the yearThere are 12 months in the year, numbered 1 through 12. They are always represented by a two-digit ASCII string whose value ranges from 01 through 12. See the table in the section Days of the month for the month numbers and their corresponding names (and lengths in days).Days of the monthMonth numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12 are 31 days long. Months 4, 6, 9, and 11 are 30 days long. Month 2, February, is 28 days long most years, but is 29 days long in leap years. This is detailed in the following table.

Week stringsA week string specifies a week within a particular year. A valid week string consists of a valid year number, followed by a hyphen character (-, or U+002D), then the capital letter W (U+0057), followed by a two-digit week of the year value.
The week of the year is a two-digit string between 01 and 53. Each week begins on Monday and ends on Sunday. That means it's possible for the first few days of January to be considered part of the previous week-year, and for the last few days of December to be considered part of the following week-year. The first week of the year is the week that contains the first Thursday of the year. For example, the first Thursday of 1953 was on January 1, so that week—beginning on Monday, December 29—is considered the first week of the year. Therefore, December 30, 1952 occurs during the week 1953-W01.
A year has 53 weeks if:

The first day of the calendar year (January 1) is a Thursday or
The first day of the year (January 1) is a Wednesday and the year is a leap year

All other years have 52 weeks.

Note that both the year and week numbers are padded with leading zeroes, with the year padded to four digits and the week to two.Month stringsA month string represents a specific month in time, rather than a generic month of the year. That is, rather than representing "January," an HTML month string represents a month and year paired, like "January 1972."
A valid month string consists of a valid year number (a string of at least four digits), followed by a hyphen character (-, or U+002D), followed by a two-digit numeric month number, where 01 represents January and 12 represents December.

Time stringsA time string can specify a time with precision to the minute, second, or to the millisecond. Specifying only the hour or minute isn't permitted. A valid time string minimally consists of a two-digit hour followed by a colon (:, U+003A), then a two-digit minute. The minute may optionally be followed by another colon and a two-digit number of seconds. Milliseconds may be specified, optionally, by adding a decimal point character (., U+002E) followed by one, two, or three digits.
There are some additional basic rules:

The hour is always specified using the 24-hour clock, with 00 being midnight and 11 PM being 23. No values outside the range 00 – 23 are permitted.
The minute must be a two-digit number between 00 and 59. No values outside that range are allowed.
If the number of seconds is omitted (to specify a time accurate only to the minute), no colon should follow the number of minutes.
If specified, the integer portion of the number of seconds must be between 00 and 59. You cannot specify leap seconds by using values like 60 or 61.
If the number of seconds is specified and is an integer, it must not be followed by a decimal point.
If a fraction of a second is included, it may be from one to three digits long, indicating the number of milliseconds. It follows the decimal point placed after the seconds component of the time string.

Local date and time stringsA valid datetime-local string consists of a date string and a time string concatenated together with either the letter T or a space character separating them. No information about the time zone is included in the string; the date and time is presumed to be in the user's local time zone.
When you set the value of a datetime-local input, the string is normalized into a standard form. Normalized datetime strings always use the letter T to separate the date and the time, and the time portion of the string is as short as possible. This is done by leaving out the seconds component if its value is :00.

          datetime-local string. The space has been replaced with
          the T character and the trailing zero in the fraction
          of a second has been removed to make the string as short as possible.

          Note that the normalized form of this date drops the
          :00 indicating the number of seconds to be zero,
          because the seconds are optional when zero, and the normalized string
          minimizes the length of the string.

Global date and time stringsA global date and time string specifies a date and time as well as the time zone in which it occurs. A valid global date and time string is the same format as a local date and time string, except it has a time zone string appended to the end, following the time.Time zone offset stringA time zone offset string specifies the offset in either a positive or a negative number of hours and minutes from the standard time base. There are two standard time bases, which are very close to the same, but not exactly the same:

For dates after the establishment of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) in the early 1960s, the time base is Z and the offset indicates a particular time zone's offset from the time at the prime meridian at 0º longitude (which passes through the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, England).
For dates prior to UTC, the time base is instead expressed in terms of UT1, which is the contemporary Earth solar time at the prime meridian.

The time zone string is appended immediately following the time in the date and time string. You can specify Z as the time zone offset string to indicate that the time is specified in UTC. Otherwise, the time zone string is constructed as follows:

A character indicating the sign of the offset: the plus character (+, or U+002B) for time zones to the east of the prime meridian or the minus character (-, or U+002D) for time zones to the west of the prime meridian.
A two-digit number of hours that the time zone is offset from the prime meridian. This value must be between 00 and 23.
An optional colon (:) character.
A two-digit number of minutes past the hour; this value must be between 00 and 59.

While this format allows for time zones between -23:59 and +23:59, the current range of time zone offsets is -12:00 to +14:00, and no time zones are currently offset from the hour by anything other than 00, 30, or 45 minutes. This may change at more or less anytime, since countries are free to tamper with their time zones at any time and in any way they wish to do so.

Date issuesBecause of data storage and precision issues, you may want to be aware of a few client-side and server-side issues.The Y2K38 Problem (often server-side)JavaScript uses double precision floating points to store dates, as with all numbers, meaning that JavaScript code will not suffer from the Y2K38 problem unless integer coercion/bit-hacks are used because all JavaScript bit operators use 32-bit signed 2s-complement integers.
The problem is with the server side of things: storage of dates greater than 2^31 - 1. To fix this problem, you must store all dates using either unsigned 32-bit integers, signed 64-bit integers, or double-precision floating points on the server. If your server is written in PHP, the fix may require upgrading your PHP to a more recent version, and upgrading your hardware to x86_64 or IA64. If you are stuck with other hardware, you can try to emulate 64-bit hardware inside a 32-bit virtual machine, but most VMs don't support this kind of virtualization, since stability may suffer, and performance will definitely suffer greatly.The Y10k Problem (often client-side)In many servers, dates are stored as numbers instead of as strings--numbers of a fixed size and agnostic of format (aside from endianness). After the year 10,000, those numbers will just be a bit bigger than before, so many servers will not see issues with forms submitted after the year 10,000.
The problem is with the client side of things: parsing of dates with more than 4 digits in the year.
html<!--midnight of January 1st, 10000: the exact time of Y10K-->
<input type="datetime-local" value="+010000-01-01T05:00" />

We need to prepare our code for any number of digits — not just 5. The following JavaScript function programmatically sets the value:
jsfunction setValue(element, date) {
  const isoString = date.toISOString();
  element.value = isoString.substring(0, isoString.indexOf("T") + 6);
}

Why worry about the Y10K problem if it is going to happen many centuries after your death? Exactly because you will already be dead, so the companies using your software will be stuck using your software without any other coder who knows the system well enough to come in and fix it.See also

BasicsBefore looking at the various formats of date and time related strings used by HTML elements, it is helpful to understand a few fundamental facts about the way they're defined. HTML uses a variation of the ISO 8601 standard for its date and time strings. It's worth reviewing the descriptions of the formats you're using in order to ensure that your strings are in fact compatible with HTML, as the HTML specification includes algorithms for parsing these strings that is actually more precise than ISO 8601, so there can be subtle differences in how date and time strings are expected to look.Character setDates and times in HTML are always strings which use the ASCII character set.Year numbersIn order to simplify the basic format used for date strings in HTML, the specification requires that all years be given using the modern (or proleptic) Gregorian calendar. While user interfaces may allow entry of dates using other calendars, the underlying value always uses the Gregorian calendar.
While the Gregorian calendar wasn't created until the year 1582 (replacing the similar Julian calendar), for HTML's purposes, the Gregorian calendar is extended back to the year 1 C.E. Make sure any older dates account for this.
For the purposes of HTML dates, years are always at least four digits long; years prior to the year 1000 are padded with leading zeroes (0), so the year 72 is written as 0072. Years prior to the year 1 C.E. are not supported, so HTML doesn't support years 1 B.C.E. (1 B.C.) or earlier.
A year is normally 365 days long, except during leap years.
Leap years
A leap year is any year which is divisible by 400 or the year is divisible by 4 but not by 100. Although the calendar year is normally 365 days long, it actually takes the planet Earth approximately 365.2422 days to complete a single orbit around the sun. Leap years help to adjust the calendar to keep it synchronized with the actual position of the planet in its orbit. Adding a day to the year every four years essentially makes the average year 365.25 days long, which is close to correct.
The adjustments to the algorithm (taking a leap year when the year can be divided by 400, and skipping leap years when the year is divisible by 100) help to bring the average even closer to the correct number of days (365.2425 days). Scientists occasionally add leap seconds to the calendar (seriously) to handle the remaining three ten-thousandths of a day and to compensate for the gradual, naturally occurring slowing of Earth's rotation.
While month 02, February, normally has 28 days, it has 29 days in leap years.Months of the yearThere are 12 months in the year, numbered 1 through 12. They are always represented by a two-digit ASCII string whose value ranges from 01 through 12. See the table in the section Days of the month for the month numbers and their corresponding names (and lengths in days).Days of the monthMonth numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12 are 31 days long. Months 4, 6, 9, and 11 are 30 days long. Month 2, February, is 28 days long most years, but is 29 days long in leap years. This is detailed in the following table.

Week stringsA week string specifies a week within a particular year. A valid week string consists of a valid year number, followed by a hyphen character (-, or U+002D), then the capital letter W (U+0057), followed by a two-digit week of the year value.
The week of the year is a two-digit string between 01 and 53. Each week begins on Monday and ends on Sunday. That means it's possible for the first few days of January to be considered part of the previous week-year, and for the last few days of December to be considered part of the following week-year. The first week of the year is the week that contains the first Thursday of the year. For example, the first Thursday of 1953 was on January 1, so that week—beginning on Monday, December 29—is considered the first week of the year. Therefore, December 30, 1952 occurs during the week 1953-W01.
A year has 53 weeks if:

The first day of the calendar year (January 1) is a Thursday or
The first day of the year (January 1) is a Wednesday and the year is a leap year

All other years have 52 weeks.

Time stringsA time string can specify a time with precision to the minute, second, or to the millisecond. Specifying only the hour or minute isn't permitted. A valid time string minimally consists of a two-digit hour followed by a colon (:, U+003A), then a two-digit minute. The minute may optionally be followed by another colon and a two-digit number of seconds. Milliseconds may be specified, optionally, by adding a decimal point character (., U+002E) followed by one, two, or three digits.
There are some additional basic rules:

The hour is always specified using the 24-hour clock, with 00 being midnight and 11 PM being 23. No values outside the range 00 – 23 are permitted.
The minute must be a two-digit number between 00 and 59. No values outside that range are allowed.
If the number of seconds is omitted (to specify a time accurate only to the minute), no colon should follow the number of minutes.
If specified, the integer portion of the number of seconds must be between 00 and 59. You cannot specify leap seconds by using values like 60 or 61.
If the number of seconds is specified and is an integer, it must not be followed by a decimal point.
If a fraction of a second is included, it may be from one to three digits long, indicating the number of milliseconds. It follows the decimal point placed after the seconds component of the time string.

Global date and time stringsA global date and time string specifies a date and time as well as the time zone in which it occurs. A valid global date and time string is the same format as a local date and time string, except it has a time zone string appended to the end, following the time.Time zone offset stringA time zone offset string specifies the offset in either a positive or a negative number of hours and minutes from the standard time base. There are two standard time bases, which are very close to the same, but not exactly the same:

For dates after the establishment of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) in the early 1960s, the time base is Z and the offset indicates a particular time zone's offset from the time at the prime meridian at 0º longitude (which passes through the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, England).
For dates prior to UTC, the time base is instead expressed in terms of UT1, which is the contemporary Earth solar time at the prime meridian.

The time zone string is appended immediately following the time in the date and time string. You can specify Z as the time zone offset string to indicate that the time is specified in UTC. Otherwise, the time zone string is constructed as follows:

A character indicating the sign of the offset: the plus character (+, or U+002B) for time zones to the east of the prime meridian or the minus character (-, or U+002D) for time zones to the west of the prime meridian.
A two-digit number of hours that the time zone is offset from the prime meridian. This value must be between 00 and 23.
An optional colon (:) character.
A two-digit number of minutes past the hour; this value must be between 00 and 59.

While this format allows for time zones between -23:59 and +23:59, the current range of time zone offsets is -12:00 to +14:00, and no time zones are currently offset from the hour by anything other than 00, 30, or 45 minutes. This may change at more or less anytime, since countries are free to tamper with their time zones at any time and in any way they wish to do so.

Date issuesBecause of data storage and precision issues, you may want to be aware of a few client-side and server-side issues.The Y2K38 Problem (often server-side)JavaScript uses double precision floating points to store dates, as with all numbers, meaning that JavaScript code will not suffer from the Y2K38 problem unless integer coercion/bit-hacks are used because all JavaScript bit operators use 32-bit signed 2s-complement integers.
The problem is with the server side of things: storage of dates greater than 2^31 - 1. To fix this problem, you must store all dates using either unsigned 32-bit integers, signed 64-bit integers, or double-precision floating points on the server. If your server is written in PHP, the fix may require upgrading your PHP to a more recent version, and upgrading your hardware to x86_64 or IA64. If you are stuck with other hardware, you can try to emulate 64-bit hardware inside a 32-bit virtual machine, but most VMs don't support this kind of virtualization, since stability may suffer, and performance will definitely suffer greatly.The Y10k Problem (often client-side)In many servers, dates are stored as numbers instead of as strings--numbers of a fixed size and agnostic of format (aside from endianness). After the year 10,000, those numbers will just be a bit bigger than before, so many servers will not see issues with forms submitted after the year 10,000.
The problem is with the client side of things: parsing of dates with more than 4 digits in the year.
html<!--midnight of January 1st, 10000: the exact time of Y10K-->
<input type="datetime-local" value="+010000-01-01T05:00" />

We need to prepare our code for any number of digits — not just 5. The following JavaScript function programmatically sets the value:
jsfunction setValue(element, date) {
  const isoString = date.toISOString();
  element.value = isoString.substring(0, isoString.indexOf("T") + 6);
}

Why worry about the Y10K problem if it is going to happen many centuries after your death? Exactly because you will already be dead, so the companies using your software will be stuck using your software without any other coder who knows the system well enough to come in and fix it.See also

BasicsBefore looking at the various formats of date and time related strings used by HTML elements, it is helpful to understand a few fundamental facts about the way they're defined. HTML uses a variation of the ISO 8601 standard for its date and time strings. It's worth reviewing the descriptions of the formats you're using in order to ensure that your strings are in fact compatible with HTML, as the HTML specification includes algorithms for parsing these strings that is actually more precise than ISO 8601, so there can be subtle differences in how date and time strings are expected to look.Character setDates and times in HTML are always strings which use the ASCII character set.Year numbersIn order to simplify the basic format used for date strings in HTML, the specification requires that all years be given using the modern (or proleptic) Gregorian calendar. While user interfaces may allow entry of dates using other calendars, the underlying value always uses the Gregorian calendar.
While the Gregorian calendar wasn't created until the year 1582 (replacing the similar Julian calendar), for HTML's purposes, the Gregorian calendar is extended back to the year 1 C.E. Make sure any older dates account for this.
For the purposes of HTML dates, years are always at least four digits long; years prior to the year 1000 are padded with leading zeroes (0), so the year 72 is written as 0072. Years prior to the year 1 C.E. are not supported, so HTML doesn't support years 1 B.C.E. (1 B.C.) or earlier.
A year is normally 365 days long, except during leap years.
Leap years
A leap year is any year which is divisible by 400 or the year is divisible by 4 but not by 100. Although the calendar year is normally 365 days long, it actually takes the planet Earth approximately 365.2422 days to complete a single orbit around the sun. Leap years help to adjust the calendar to keep it synchronized with the actual position of the planet in its orbit. Adding a day to the year every four years essentially makes the average year 365.25 days long, which is close to correct.
The adjustments to the algorithm (taking a leap year when the year can be divided by 400, and skipping leap years when the year is divisible by 100) help to bring the average even closer to the correct number of days (365.2425 days). Scientists occasionally add leap seconds to the calendar (seriously) to handle the remaining three ten-thousandths of a day and to compensate for the gradual, naturally occurring slowing of Earth's rotation.
While month 02, February, normally has 28 days, it has 29 days in leap years.Months of the yearThere are 12 months in the year, numbered 1 through 12. They are always represented by a two-digit ASCII string whose value ranges from 01 through 12. See the table in the section Days of the month for the month numbers and their corresponding names (and lengths in days).Days of the monthMonth numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12 are 31 days long. Months 4, 6, 9, and 11 are 30 days long. Month 2, February, is 28 days long most years, but is 29 days long in leap years. This is detailed in the following table.

Week stringsA week string specifies a week within a particular year. A valid week string consists of a valid year number, followed by a hyphen character (-, or U+002D), then the capital letter W (U+0057), followed by a two-digit week of the year value.
The week of the year is a two-digit string between 01 and 53. Each week begins on Monday and ends on Sunday. That means it's possible for the first few days of January to be considered part of the previous week-year, and for the last few days of December to be considered part of the following week-year. The first week of the year is the week that contains the first Thursday of the year. For example, the first Thursday of 1953 was on January 1, so that week—beginning on Monday, December 29—is considered the first week of the year. Therefore, December 30, 1952 occurs during the week 1953-W01.
A year has 53 weeks if:

The first day of the calendar year (January 1) is a Thursday or
The first day of the year (January 1) is a Wednesday and the year is a leap year

All other years have 52 weeks.

That is, rather than representing "January," an HTML month string represents a month and year paired, like "January 1972."
A valid month string consists of a valid year number (a string of at least four digits), followed by a hyphen character (-, or U+002D), followed by a two-digit numeric month number, where 01 represents January and 12 represents December.

Time stringsA time string can specify a time with precision to the minute, second, or to the millisecond. Specifying only the hour or minute isn't permitted. A valid time string minimally consists of a two-digit hour followed by a colon (:, U+003A), then a two-digit minute. The minute may optionally be followed by another colon and a two-digit number of seconds. Milliseconds may be specified, optionally, by adding a decimal point character (., U+002E) followed by one, two, or three digits.
There are some additional basic rules:

The hour is always specified using the 24-hour clock, with 00 being midnight and 11 PM being 23. No values outside the range 00 – 23 are permitted.
The minute must be a two-digit number between 00 and 59. No values outside that range are allowed.
If the number of seconds is omitted (to specify a time accurate only to the minute), no colon should follow the number of minutes.
If specified, the integer portion of the number of seconds must be between 00 and 59. You cannot specify leap seconds by using values like 60 or 61.
If the number of seconds is specified and is an integer, it must not be followed by a decimal point.
If a fraction of a second is included, it may be from one to three digits long, indicating the number of milliseconds. It follows the decimal point placed after the seconds component of the time string.

Local date and time stringsA valid datetime-local string consists of a date string and a time string concatenated together with either the letter T or a space character separating them. No information about the time zone is included in the string; the date and time is presumed to be in the user's local time zone.
When you set the value of a datetime-local input, the string is normalized into a standard form. Normalized datetime strings always use the letter T to separate the date and the time, and the time portion of the string is as short as possible. This is done by leaving out the seconds component if its value is :00.

          Note that after normalization, this is the same string as the previous
          datetime-local string. The space has been replaced with
          the T character and the trailing zero in the fraction
          of a second has been removed to make the string as short as possible.

        0170-07-31T22:00
        
          Note that the normalized form of this date drops the
          :00 indicating the number of seconds to be zero,
          because the seconds are optional when zero, and the normalized string
          minimizes the length of the string.

Global date and time stringsA global date and time string specifies a date and time as well as the time zone in which it occurs. A valid global date and time string is the same format as a local date and time string, except it has a time zone string appended to the end, following the time.Time zone offset stringA time zone offset string specifies the offset in either a positive or a negative number of hours and minutes from the standard time base. There are two standard time bases, which are very close to the same, but not exactly the same:

For dates after the establishment of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) in the early 1960s, the time base is Z and the offset indicates a particular time zone's offset from the time at the prime meridian at 0º longitude (which passes through the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, England).
For dates prior to UTC, the time base is instead expressed in terms of UT1, which is the contemporary Earth solar time at the prime meridian.

The time zone string is appended immediately following the time in the date and time string. You can specify Z as the time zone offset string to indicate that the time is specified in UTC. Otherwise, the time zone string is constructed as follows:

A character indicating the sign of the offset: the plus character (+, or U+002B) for time zones to the east of the prime meridian or the minus character (-, or U+002D) for time zones to the west of the prime meridian.
A two-digit number of hours that the time zone is offset from the prime meridian. This value must be between 00 and 23.
An optional colon (:) character.
A two-digit number of minutes past the hour; this value must be between 00 and 59.

While this format allows for time zones between -23:59 and +23:59, the current range of time zone offsets is -12:00 to +14:00, and no time zones are currently offset from the hour by anything other than 00, 30, or 45 minutes. This may change at more or less anytime, since countries are free to tamper with their time zones at any time and in any way they wish to do so.

While marking up the form itself is easy, checking whether each field has a valid and coherent value is more difficult, and informing the user about the problem may become a headache. HTML5 introduced new mechanisms for forms: it added new semantic types for the <input> element and constraint validation to ease the work of checking the form content on the client side. Basic, usual constraints can be checked, without the need for JavaScript, by setting new attributes; more complex constraints can be tested using the Constraint Validation API.
For a basic introduction to these concepts, with examples, see the Form validation tutorial.

Note:
HTML Constraint validation doesn't remove the need for validation on the server side. Even though far fewer invalid form requests are to be expected, invalid ones can still be sent in many ways:

By modifying HTML via the browser's developer tools.
By hand-crafting an HTTP request without using the form.
By programmatically writing content into the form (certain constraint validations are only run for user input, and not if you set the value of a form field using JavaScript).

Therefore, you should always validate form data on the server side, consistent with what is done on the client side.
Intrinsic and basic constraintsIn HTML, basic constraints are declared in two ways:

By choosing the most semantically appropriate value for the type attribute of the <input> element, e.g., choosing the email type automatically creates a constraint that checks whether the value is a valid email address.
By setting values on validation-related attributes, allowing basic constraints to be described without the need for JavaScript.
Semantic input typesThe intrinsic constraints for the type attribute are:



Input type
Constraint description
Associated violation




<input type="URL">
The value must be an absolute URL, as defined in the URL Living Standard.
TypeMismatch constraint violation


<input type="email">
The value must be a syntactically valid email address, which generally has the format username@hostname.tld but can also be local such as username@hostname.
TypeMismatch constraint violation



For both of these input types, if the multiple attribute is set, several values can be set, as a comma-separated list. If any of these do not satisfy the condition described here, the Type mismatch constraint violation is triggered.
Note that most input types don't have intrinsic constraints, as some are barred from constraint validation or have a sanitization algorithm transforming incorrect values to a correct default.Validation-related attributesIn addition to the type attribute described above, the following attributes are used to describe basic constraints:

Constraint validation processConstraint validation is done through the Constraint Validation API either on a single form element or at the form level, on the <form> element itself. The constraint validation is done in the following ways:

By a call to the checkValidity() or reportValidity() method of a form-associated DOM interface, (HTMLInputElement, HTMLSelectElement, HTMLButtonElement, HTMLOutputElement or HTMLTextAreaElement), which evaluates the constraints only on this element, allowing a script to get this information. The checkValidity() method returns a Boolean indicating whether the element's value passes its constraints. (This is typically done by the user-agent when determining which of the CSS pseudo-classes, :valid or :invalid, applies.) In contrast, the reportValidity() method reports any constraint failures to the user.
By a call to the checkValidity() or reportValidity() method on the HTMLFormElement interface.
By submitting the form itself.

Calling checkValidity() is called statically validating the constraints, while calling reportValidity() or submitting the form is called interactively validating the constraints.

Note:

If the novalidate attribute is set on the <form> element, interactive validation of the constraints doesn't happen.
Calling the submit() method on the HTMLFormElement interface doesn't trigger a constraint validation. In other words, this method sends the form data to the server even if it doesn't satisfy the constraints. Call the click() method on a submit button instead.
The minlength and maxlength constraints are only checked on user-provided input. They are not checked if a value is set programmatically, even when explicitly calling checkValidity() or reportValidity().

Complex constraints using the Constraint Validation APIUsing JavaScript and the Constraint API, it is possible to implement more complex constraints, for example, constraints combining several fields, or constraints involving complex calculations.
Basically, the idea is to trigger JavaScript on some form field event (like onchange) to calculate whether the constraint is violated, and then to use the method field.setCustomValidity() to set the result of the validation: an empty string means the constraint is satisfied, and any other string means there is an error and this string is the error message to display to the user.Constraint combining several fields: Postal code validationThe postal code format varies from one country to another. Not only do most countries allow an optional prefix with the country code (like D- in Germany, F- in France or Switzerland), but some countries have postal codes with only a fixed number of digits; others, like the UK, have more complex structures, allowing letters at some specific positions.

Note:
This is not a comprehensive postal code validation library, but rather a demonstration of the key concepts.

As an example, we will add a script checking the constraint validation for a form:
html<form>
  <label for="postal-code">Postal Code: </label>
  <input type="text" id="postal-code" />
  <label for="country">Country: </label>
  <select id="country">
    <option value="ch">Switzerland</option>
    <option value="fr">France</option>
    <option value="de">Germany</option>
    <option value="nl">The Netherlands</option>
  </select>
  <input type="submit" value="Validate" />
</form>

This displays the following form:

First, we write a function checking the constraint itself:
jsfunction checkPostalCode() {
  // For each country, defines the pattern that the postal code has to follow
  const constraints = {
    ch: [
      "^(CH-)?\\d{4}$",
      "Swiss postal codes must have exactly 4 digits: e.g. CH-1950 or 1950",
    ],
    fr: [
      "^(F-)?\\d{5}$",
      "French postal codes must have exactly 5 digits: e.g. F-75012 or 75012",
    ],
    de: [
      "^(D-)?\\d{5}$",
      "German postal codes must have exactly 5 digits: e.g. D-12345 or 12345",
    ],
    nl: [
      "^(NL-)?\\d{4}\ *([A-RT-Z][A-Z]|S[BCE-RT-Z])$",
      "Dutch postal codes must have exactly 4 digits, followed by 2 letters except SA, SD and SS",
    ],
  };

  // Read the country id
  const country = document.getElementById("country").value;

  // Get the NPA field
  const postalCodeField = document.getElementById("postal-code");

  // Build the constraint checker
  const constraint = new RegExp(constraints[country][0], "");
  console.log(constraint);

  // Check it!
  if (constraint.test(postalCodeField.value)) {
    // The postal code follows the constraint, we use the ConstraintAPI to tell it
    postalCodeField.setCustomValidity("");
  } else {
    // The postal code doesn't follow the constraint, we use the ConstraintAPI to
    // give a message about the format required for this country
    postalCodeField.setCustomValidity(constraints[country][1]);
  }
}

Then we link it to the onchange event for the <select> and the oninput event for the <input>:
jswindow.onload = () => {
  document.getElementById("country").onchange = checkPostalCode;
  document.getElementById("postal-code").oninput = checkPostalCode;
};
Limiting the size of a file before its uploadAnother common constraint is to limit the size of a file to be uploaded. Checking this on the client side before the file is transmitted to the server requires combining the Constraint Validation API, and especially the field.setCustomValidity() method, with another JavaScript API, here the File API.
Here is the HTML part:
html<label for="fs">Select a file smaller than 75 kB: </label>
<input type="file" id="fs" />

This displays:

The JavaScript reads the file selected, uses the File.size() method to get its size, compares it to the (hard coded) limit, and calls the Constraint API to inform the browser if there is a violation:
jsfunction checkFileSize() {
  const fs = document.getElementById("fs");
  const files = fs.files;

  // If there is (at least) one file selected
  if (files.length > 0) {
    if (files[0].size > 75 * 1000) {
      // Check the constraint
      fs.setCustomValidity("The selected file must not be larger than 75 kB");
      fs.reportValidity();
      return;
    }
  }
  // No custom constraint violation
  fs.setCustomValidity("");
}

Finally, we hook the method with the correct event:
jswindow.onload = () => {
  document.getElementById("fs").onchange = checkFileSize;
};
Visual styling of constraint validationApart from setting constraints, web developers want to control what messages are displayed to the users and how they are styled.Controlling the look of elementsThe look of elements can be controlled via CSS pseudo-classes.
:required and :optional CSS pseudo-classes
The :required and :optional pseudo-classes allow writing selectors that match form elements that have the required attribute, or that don't have it.
:placeholder-shown CSS pseudo-class
See :placeholder-shown.
:valid :invalid CSS pseudo-classes
The :valid and :invalid pseudo-classes are used to represent <input> elements whose content validates and fails to validate respectively according to the input's type setting. These classes allow the user to style valid or invalid form elements to make it easier to identify elements that are either formatted correctly or incorrectly.Controlling the text of constraint violationThe following items can help with controlling the text of a constraint violation:


The setCustomValidity(message) method on the following elements:

<fieldset>. Note: Setting a custom validity message on fieldset elements will not prevent form submission in most browsers.
<input>
<output>
<select>
Submit buttons (created with either a <button> element with the submit type, or an input element with the submit type. Other types of buttons do not participate in constraint validation.
<textarea>



The ValidityState interface describes the object returned by the validity property of the element types listed above. It represents various ways that an entered value can be invalid. Together, they help explain why an element's value fails to validate, if it's not valid.\n\nUsing HTML form validation and the Constraint Validation APIThe creation of web forms has always been a complex task. While marking up the form itself is easy, checking whether each field has a valid and coherent value is more difficult, and informing the user about the problem may become a headache. HTML5 introduced new mechanisms for forms: it added new semantic types for the <input> element and constraint validation to ease the work of checking the form content on the client side. Basic, usual constraints can be checked, without the need for JavaScript, by setting new attributes; more complex constraints can be tested using the Constraint Validation API.
For a basic introduction to these concepts, with examples, see the Form validation tutorial.

Note:
HTML Constraint validation doesn't remove the need for validation on the server side. Even though far fewer invalid form requests are to be expected, invalid ones can still be sent in many ways:

By modifying HTML via the browser's developer tools.
By hand-crafting an HTTP request without using the form.
By programmatically writing content into the form (certain constraint validations are only run for user input, and not if you set the value of a form field using JavaScript).

Therefore, you should always validate form data on the server side, consistent with what is done on the client side.
Intrinsic and basic constraintsIn HTML, basic constraints are declared in two ways:

By choosing the most semantically appropriate value for the type attribute of the <input> element, e.g., choosing the email type automatically creates a constraint that checks whether the value is a valid email address.
By setting values on validation-related attributes, allowing basic constraints to be described without the need for JavaScript.
Semantic input typesThe intrinsic constraints for the type attribute are:



Input type
Constraint description
Associated violation




<input type="URL">
The value must be an absolute URL, as defined in the URL Living Standard.
TypeMismatch constraint violation


<input type="email">
The value must be a syntactically valid email address, which generally has the format username@hostname.tld but can also be local such as username@hostname.
TypeMismatch constraint violation



For both of these input types, if the multiple attribute is set, several values can be set, as a comma-separated list. If any of these do not satisfy the condition described here, the Type mismatch constraint violation is triggered.
Note that most input types don't have intrinsic constraints, as some are barred from constraint validation or have a sanitization algorithm transforming incorrect values to a correct default.Validation-related attributesIn addition to the type attribute described above, the following attributes are used to describe basic constraints:

  
    
      Attribute
      Input types supporting the attribute

Note that most input types don't have intrinsic constraints, as some are barred from constraint validation or have a sanitization algorithm transforming incorrect values to a correct default.Validation-related attributesIn addition to the type attribute described above, the following attributes are used to describe basic constraints:

Constraint validation processConstraint validation is done through the Constraint Validation API either on a single form element or at the form level, on the <form> element itself. The constraint validation is done in the following ways:

By a call to the checkValidity() or reportValidity() method of a form-associated DOM interface, (HTMLInputElement, HTMLSelectElement, HTMLButtonElement, HTMLOutputElement or HTMLTextAreaElement), which evaluates the constraints only on this element, allowing a script to get this information. The checkValidity() method returns a Boolean indicating whether the element's value passes its constraints. (This is typically done by the user-agent when determining which of the CSS pseudo-classes, :valid or :invalid, applies.) In contrast, the reportValidity() method reports any constraint failures to the user.
By a call to the checkValidity() or reportValidity() method on the HTMLFormElement interface.
By submitting the form itself.

Calling checkValidity() is called statically validating the constraints, while calling reportValidity() or submitting the form is called interactively validating the constraints.

Note:

If the novalidate attribute is set on the <form> element, interactive validation of the constraints doesn't happen.
Calling the submit() method on the HTMLFormElement interface doesn't trigger a constraint validation. In other words, this method sends the form data to the server even if it doesn't satisfy the constraints. Call the click() method on a submit button instead.
The minlength and maxlength constraints are only checked on user-provided input. They are not checked if a value is set programmatically, even when explicitly calling checkValidity() or reportValidity().

Complex constraints using the Constraint Validation APIUsing JavaScript and the Constraint API, it is possible to implement more complex constraints, for example, constraints combining several fields, or constraints involving complex calculations.
Basically, the idea is to trigger JavaScript on some form field event (like onchange) to calculate whether the constraint is violated, and then to use the method field.setCustomValidity() to set the result of the validation: an empty string means the constraint is satisfied, and any other string means there is an error and this string is the error message to display to the user.Constraint combining several fields: Postal code validationThe postal code format varies from one country to another. Not only do most countries allow an optional prefix with the country code (like D- in Germany, F- in France or Switzerland), but some countries have postal codes with only a fixed number of digits; others, like the UK, have more complex structures, allowing letters at some specific positions.

Note:
This is not a comprehensive postal code validation library, but rather a demonstration of the key concepts.

As an example, we will add a script checking the constraint validation for a form:
html<form>
  <label for="postal-code">Postal Code: </label>
  <input type="text" id="postal-code" />
  <label for="country">Country: </label>
  <select id="country">
    <option value="ch">Switzerland</option>
    <option value="fr">France</option>
    <option value="de">Germany</option>
    <option value="nl">The Netherlands</option>
  </select>
  <input type="submit" value="Validate" />
</form>

This displays the following form:

First, we write a function checking the constraint itself:
jsfunction checkPostalCode() {
  // For each country, defines the pattern that the postal code has to follow
  const constraints = {
    ch: [
      "^(CH-)?\\d{4}$",
      "Swiss postal codes must have exactly 4 digits: e.g. CH-1950 or 1950",
    ],
    fr: [
      "^(F-)?\\d{5}$",
      "French postal codes must have exactly 5 digits: e.g. F-75012 or 75012",
    ],
    de: [
      "^(D-)?\\d{5}$",
      "German postal codes must have exactly 5 digits: e.g. D-12345 or 12345",
    ],
    nl: [
      "^(NL-)?\\d{4}\ *([A-RT-Z][A-Z]|S[BCE-RT-Z])$",
      "Dutch postal codes must have exactly 4 digits, followed by 2 letters except SA, SD and SS",
    ],
  };

  // Read the country id
  const country = document.getElementById("country").value;

  // Get the NPA field
  const postalCodeField = document.getElementById("postal-code");

  // Build the constraint checker
  const constraint = new RegExp(constraints[country][0], "");
  console.log(constraint);

  // Check it!
  if (constraint.test(postalCodeField.value)) {
    // The postal code follows the constraint, we use the ConstraintAPI to tell it
    postalCodeField.setCustomValidity("");
  } else {
    // The postal code doesn't follow the constraint, we use the ConstraintAPI to
    // give a message about the format required for this country
    postalCodeField.setCustomValidity(constraints[country][1]);
  }
}

Then we link it to the onchange event for the <select> and the oninput event for the <input>:
jswindow.onload = () => {
  document.getElementById("country").onchange = checkPostalCode;
  document.getElementById("postal-code").oninput = checkPostalCode;
};
Limiting the size of a file before its uploadAnother common constraint is to limit the size of a file to be uploaded. Checking this on the client side before the file is transmitted to the server requires combining the Constraint Validation API, and especially the field.setCustomValidity() method, with another JavaScript API, here the File API.
Here is the HTML part:
html<label for="fs">Select a file smaller than 75 kB: </label>
<input type="file" id="fs" />

This displays:

The JavaScript reads the file selected, uses the File.size() method to get its size, compares it to the (hard coded) limit, and calls the Constraint API to inform the browser if there is a violation:
jsfunction checkFileSize() {
  const fs = document.getElementById("fs");
  const files = fs.files;

  // If there is (at least) one file selected
  if (files.length > 0) {
    if (files[0].size > 75 * 1000) {
      // Check the constraint
      fs.setCustomValidity("The selected file must not be larger than 75 kB");
      fs.reportValidity();
      return;
    }
  }
  // No custom constraint violation
  fs.setCustomValidity("");
}

Finally, we hook the method with the correct event:
jswindow.onload = () => {
  document.getElementById("fs").onchange = checkFileSize;
};
Visual styling of constraint validationApart from setting constraints, web developers want to control what messages are displayed to the users and how they are styled.Controlling the look of elementsThe look of elements can be controlled via CSS pseudo-classes.
:required and :optional CSS pseudo-classes
The :required and :optional pseudo-classes allow writing selectors that match form elements that have the required attribute, or that don't have it.
:placeholder-shown CSS pseudo-class
See :placeholder-shown.
:valid :invalid CSS pseudo-classes
The :valid and :invalid pseudo-classes are used to represent <input> elements whose content validates and fails to validate respectively according to the input's type setting. These classes allow the user to style valid or invalid form elements to make it easier to identify elements that are either formatted correctly or incorrectly.Controlling the text of constraint violationThe following items can help with controlling the text of a constraint violation:


The setCustomValidity(message) method on the following elements:

<fieldset>. Note: Setting a custom validity message on fieldset elements will not prevent form submission in most browsers.
<input>
<output>
<select>
Submit buttons (created with either a <button> element with the submit type, or an input element with the submit type. Other types of buttons do not participate in constraint validation.
<textarea>



The ValidityState interface describes the object returned by the validity property of the element types listed above. It represents various ways that an entered value can be invalid. Together, they help explain why an element's value fails to validate, if it's not valid.

This is often not the same size as the rendered page, in which case the browser provides scrollbars for the user to scroll around and access all the content.
Some mobile devices and other narrow screens render pages in a virtual window or viewport, which is usually wider than the screen, and then shrink the rendered result down so it can all be seen at once. Users can then zoom and pan to look more closely at different areas of the page. For example, if a mobile screen has a width of 640px, pages might be rendered with a virtual viewport of 980px, and then it will be shrunk down to fit into the 640px space.
This is done because not all pages are optimized for mobile and break (or at least look bad) when rendered at a small viewport width. This virtual viewport is a way to make non-mobile-optimized sites in general look better on narrow screen devices.
However, this mechanism is not so good for pages that are optimized for narrow screens using media queries — if the virtual viewport is 980px for example, media queries that kick in at 640px or 480px or less will never be used, limiting the effectiveness of such responsive design techniques. The viewport <meta> element mitigates this problem of virtual viewport on narrow screen devices.Viewport basicsThe viewport is a comma-separated list of feature and value pairs. A typical mobile-optimized site contains something like the following:
html<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />

Not all devices are the same width; you should make sure that your pages work well in a large variation of screen sizes and orientations.
The basic attributes of the "viewport" <meta> element include:

width

Controls the (minimum) size of the viewport (see viewport width and screen width). It can be set to a specific number of pixels like width=600 or to the special value device-width, which is the physical size of the device screen in CSS pixels. This value establishes the value of the vw unit. Minimum: 1. Maximum: 10000. Negative values: ignored.

height

Controls the (minimum) size of the viewport (see viewport width and screen width). It can be set to a specific number of pixels like height=400 or to the special value device-height, which is the physical size of the device screen in CSS pixels. This value establishes the value of the vh unit. Minimum: 1. Maximum: 10000. Negative values: ignored.

initial-scale

Controls the zoom level when the page is first loaded. Minimum: 0.1. Maximum: 10. Default: 1. Negative values: ignored.

minimum-scale

Controls how much zoom out is allowed on the page. Minimum: 0.1. Maximum: 10. Default: 0.1. Negative values: ignored.

maximum-scale

Controls how much zoom in is allowed on the page. Any value less than 3 fails accessibility. Minimum: 0.1. Maximum: 10. Default: 10. Negative values: ignored.

user-scalable

Controls whether zoom in and zoom out actions are allowed on the page. Valid values: 0, 1, yes, or no. Default: 1, which is the same as yes. Setting the value to 0, which is the same as no, is against Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).

interactive-widget

Specifies the effect that interactive UI widgets, such as a virtual keyboard, have on the page's viewports. Valid values: resizes-visual, resizes-content, or overlays-content. Default: resizes-visual.



Warning:
Usage of user-scalable=no can cause accessibility issues to users with visual impairments such as low vision. WCAG requires a minimum of 2× scaling; however, the best practice is to enable a 5× zoom.
Screen densityScreen resolutions have risen to the size that individual pixels are indistinguishable by the human eye. For example, smartphones often have small screens with resolutions upwards of 1920–1080 pixels (≈400dpi). Because of this, many browsers can display their pages in a smaller physical size by translating multiple hardware pixels for each CSS "pixel". Initially, this caused usability and readability problems on many touch-optimized websites.
On high dpi screens, pages with initial-scale=1 will effectively be zoomed by browsers. Their text will be smooth and crisp, but their bitmap images may not take advantage of the full screen resolution. To get sharper images on these screens, web developers may want to design images – or whole layouts – at a higher scale than their final size and then scale them down using CSS or viewport properties.
The default pixel ratio depends on the display density. On a display with density less than 200dpi, the ratio is 1.0. On displays with density between 200 and 300dpi, the ratio is 1.5. For displays with density over 300dpi, the ratio is the integer floor (density/150dpi). Note that the default ratio is true only when the viewport scale equals 1. Otherwise, the relationship between CSS pixels and device pixels depends on the current zoom level.Viewport width and screen widthSites can set their viewport to a specific size. For example, the definition "width=320, initial-scale=1" can be used to fit precisely onto a small phone display in portrait mode. This can cause problems when the browser renders a page at a larger size. To fix this, browsers will expand the viewport width if necessary to fill the screen at the requested scale. This is especially useful on large-screen devices.
For pages that set an initial or maximum scale, this means the width property actually translates into a minimum viewport width. For example, if your layout needs at least 500 pixels of width then you can use the following markup. When the screen is more than 500 pixels wide, the browser will expand the viewport (rather than zoom in) to fit the screen:
html<meta name="viewport" content="width=500, initial-scale=1" />

Other attributes that are available are minimum-scale, maximum-scale, and user-scalable. These properties affect the initial scale and width, as well as limiting changes in zoom level.The effect of interactive UI widgetsInteractive UI widgets of the browser can influence the size of the page's viewports. The most common such UI widget is a virtual keyboard. To control which resize behavior the browser should use, set the interactive-widget property.
Allowed values are:

resizes-visual

The visual viewport gets resized by the interactive widget.

resizes-content

The viewport gets resized by the interactive widget.

overlays-content

Neither the viewport nor the visual viewport gets resized by the interactive widget.


html<meta name="viewport" content="interactive-widget=resizes-content" />

When the viewport gets resized, the initial containing block also gets resized, thereby affecting the computed size of viewport units.Common viewport sizes for mobile and tablet devicesIf you want to know what mobile and tablet devices have which viewport widths, there is a comprehensive list of mobile and tablet viewport sizes here.

Controls how much zoom in is allowed on the page. Any value less than 3 fails accessibility. Minimum: 0.1. Maximum: 10. Default: 10. Negative values: ignored.

user-scalable

Controls whether zoom in and zoom out actions are allowed on the page. Valid values: 0, 1, yes, or no. Default: 1, which is the same as yes. Setting the value to 0, which is the same as no, is against Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).

interactive-widget

Specifies the effect that interactive UI widgets, such as a virtual keyboard, have on the page's viewports. Valid values: resizes-visual, resizes-content, or overlays-content. Default: resizes-visual.



Warning:
Usage of user-scalable=no can cause accessibility issues to users with visual impairments such as low vision. WCAG requires a minimum of 2× scaling; however, the best practice is to enable a 5× zoom.
Screen densityScreen resolutions have risen to the size that individual pixels are indistinguishable by the human eye. For example, smartphones often have small screens with resolutions upwards of 1920–1080 pixels (≈400dpi). Because of this, many browsers can display their pages in a smaller physical size by translating multiple hardware pixels for each CSS "pixel". Initially, this caused usability and readability problems on many touch-optimized websites.
On high dpi screens, pages with initial-scale=1 will effectively be zoomed by browsers. Their text will be smooth and crisp, but their bitmap images may not take advantage of the full screen resolution. To get sharper images on these screens, web developers may want to design images – or whole layouts – at a higher scale than their final size and then scale them down using CSS or viewport properties.
The default pixel ratio depends on the display density. On a display with density less than 200dpi, the ratio is 1.0. On displays with density between 200 and 300dpi, the ratio is 1.5. For displays with density over 300dpi, the ratio is the integer floor (density/150dpi). Note that the default ratio is true only when the viewport scale equals 1. Otherwise, the relationship between CSS pixels and device pixels depends on the current zoom level.Viewport width and screen widthSites can set their viewport to a specific size. For example, the definition "width=320, initial-scale=1" can be used to fit precisely onto a small phone display in portrait mode. This can cause problems when the browser renders a page at a larger size. To fix this, browsers will expand the viewport width if necessary to fill the screen at the requested scale. This is especially useful on large-screen devices.
For pages that set an initial or maximum scale, this means the width property actually translates into a minimum viewport width. For example, if your layout needs at least 500 pixels of width then you can use the following markup. When the screen is more than 500 pixels wide, the browser will expand the viewport (rather than zoom in) to fit the screen:
html<meta name="viewport" content="width=500, initial-scale=1" />

Other attributes that are available are minimum-scale, maximum-scale, and user-scalable. These properties affect the initial scale and width, as well as limiting changes in zoom level.The effect of interactive UI widgetsInteractive UI widgets of the browser can influence the size of the page's viewports. The most common such UI widget is a virtual keyboard. To control which resize behavior the browser should use, set the interactive-widget property.
Allowed values are:

resizes-visual

The visual viewport gets resized by the interactive widget.

resizes-content

The viewport gets resized by the interactive widget.

overlays-content

Neither the viewport nor the visual viewport gets resized by the interactive widget.


html<meta name="viewport" content="interactive-widget=resizes-content" />

When the viewport gets resized, the initial containing block also gets resized, thereby affecting the computed size of viewport units.Common viewport sizes for mobile and tablet devicesIf you want to know what mobile and tablet devices have which viewport widths, there is a comprehensive list of mobile and tablet viewport sizes here. This gives information such as viewport width on portrait and landscape orientation as well as physical screen size, operating system and the pixel density of the device.SpecificationsSpecificationCSS Viewport Module Level 1 # viewport-metaSee also

This helps to improve performance across different devices.Why responsive images?Let's examine a typical scenario. A typical website may contain a header image and some content images below the header. The header image will likely span the whole of the width of the header, and the content image will fit somewhere inside the content column. Here's an example:

This works well on a wide screen device, such as a laptop or desktop (you can see the example live and find the source code on GitHub.) We won't discuss the CSS much in this lesson, except to say that:

The body content has been set to a maximum width of 1200 pixels — in viewports above that width, the body remains at 1200px and centers itself in the available space. In viewports below that width, the body will stay at 100% of the width of the viewport.
The header image has been set so that its center always stays in the center of the header, no matter what width the heading is set at. If the site is being viewed on a narrower screen, the important detail in the center of the image (the people) can still be seen, and the excess is lost off either side. It is 200px high.
The content images have been set so that if the body element becomes smaller than the image, the images start to shrink so that they always stay inside the body, rather than overflowing it.

However, issues arise when you start to view the site on a narrow screen device. The header below looks OK, but it's starting to take up a lot of the screen height for a mobile device. And at this size, it is difficult to see faces of the two people within the first content image.

An improvement would be to display a cropped version of the image which displays the important details of the image when the site is viewed on a narrow screen. A second cropped image could be displayed for a medium-width screen device, like a tablet. The general problem whereby you want to serve different cropped images in that way, for various layouts, is commonly known as the art direction problem.
In addition, there is no need to embed such large images on the page if it is being viewed on a mobile screen. Doing so can waste bandwidth; in particular, mobile users don't want to waste bandwidth by downloading a large image intended for desktop users, when a small image would do for their device. Conversely, a small raster image starts to look grainy when displayed larger than its original size (a raster image is a set number of pixels wide and a set number of pixels tall). Ideally, multiple resolutions would be made available to the user's web browser. The browser could then determine the optimal resolution to load based on the screen size of the user's device. This is called the resolution switching problem.
To make things more complicated, some devices have high resolution screens that need larger images than you might expect to display nicely. This is essentially the same problem, but in a slightly different context.
You might think that vector images would solve these problems, and they do to a certain degree — they are small in file size and scale well, and you should use them wherever possible. However, they aren't suitable for all image types. Vector images are great for simple graphics, patterns, interface elements, etc., but it starts to get very complex to create a vector-based image with the kind of detail that you'd find in say, a photo. Raster image formats such as JPEGs are more suited to the kind of images we see in the above example.
This kind of problem didn't exist when the web first existed, in the early to mid 90s — back then the only devices in existence to browse the Web were desktops and laptops, so browser engineers and spec writers didn't even think to implement solutions. Responsive image technologies were implemented recently to solve the problems indicated above by letting you offer the browser several image files, either all showing the same thing but containing different numbers of pixels (resolution switching), or different images suitable for different space allocations (art direction).

Note:
The new features discussed in this article — srcset/sizes/<picture> — are all supported in modern desktop and mobile browsers.
How do you create responsive images?In this section, we'll look at the two problems illustrated above and show how to solve them using HTML's responsive image features. You should note that we will be focusing on <img> elements for this section, as seen in the content area of the example above — the image in the site header is only for decoration, and therefore implemented using CSS background images. CSS arguably has better tools for responsive design than HTML, and we'll talk about those in a future CSS module.Resolution switching: Different sizesSo, what is the problem that we want to solve with resolution switching? We want to display identical image content, just larger or smaller depending on the device — this is the situation we have with the second content image in our example. The standard <img> element traditionally only lets you point the browser to a single source file:
html<img src="elva-fairy-800w.jpg" alt="Elva dressed as a fairy" />

We can however use two attributes — srcset and sizes — to provide several additional source images along with hints to help the browser pick the right one. You can see an example of this in our responsive.html example on GitHub (see also the source code):
html<img
  srcset="elva-fairy-480w.jpg 480w, elva-fairy-800w.jpg 800w"
  sizes="(max-width: 600px) 480px,
         800px"
  src="elva-fairy-800w.jpg"
  alt="Elva dressed as a fairy" />

The srcset and sizes attributes look complicated, but they're not too hard to understand if you format them as shown above, with a different part of the attribute value on each line. Each value contains a comma-separated list, and each part of those lists is made up of three sub-parts. Let's run through the contents of each now:
srcset defines the set of images we will allow the browser to choose between, and what size each image is. Each set of image information is separated from the previous one by a comma. For each one, we write:

An image filename (elva-fairy-480w.jpg)
A space
The image's intrinsic width in pixels (480w) — note that this uses the w unit, not px as you might expect. An image's intrinsic size is its real size, which can be found by inspecting the image file on your computer (for example, on a Mac you can select the image in Finder and press Cmd + I to bring up the info screen).

sizes defines a set of media conditions (e.g., screen widths) and indicates what image size would be best to choose, when certain media conditions are true — these are the hints we talked about earlier. In this case, before each comma we write:

A media condition ((max-width:600px)) — you'll learn more about these in the CSS topic, but for now let's just say that a media condition describes a possible state that the screen can be in. In this case, we are saying "when the viewport width is 600 pixels or less".
A space
The width of the slot the image will fill when the media condition is true (480px)


Note:
In sizes, you can use any length value. For example, rather than providing an absolute width (for example, 480px), you can alternatively provide a width relative to the viewport (for example, 50vw). However, you cannot use a percentage as the slot width. You may have noticed that the last slot width has no media condition (this is the default that is chosen when none of the media conditions are true). The browser ignores everything after the first matching condition, so be careful how you order the media conditions.

So, with these attributes in place, the browser will:

Look at screen size, pixel density, zoom level, screen orientation, and network speed.
Work out which media condition in the sizes list is the first one to be true.
Look at the slot size given to that media query.
Load the image referenced in the srcset list that has the same size as the slot or, if there isn't one, the first image that is bigger than the chosen slot size.

And that's it! At this point, if a supporting browser with a viewport width of 480px loads the page, the (max-width: 600px) media condition will be true, and so the browser chooses the 480px slot. The elva-fairy-480w.jpg will be loaded, as its inherent width (480w) is closest to the slot size. The 800px picture is 128KB on disk, whereas the 480px version is only 63KB — a saving of 65KB. Now, imagine if this was a page that had many pictures on it. Using this technique could save mobile users a lot of bandwidth.

Note:
When testing this with a desktop browser, if the browser fails to load the narrower images when you've got its window set to the narrowest width, have a look at what the viewport is (you can approximate it by going into the browser's JavaScript console and typing in document.querySelector('html').clientWidth). Different browsers have minimum sizes that they'll let you reduce the window width to, and they might be wider than you'd think. When testing it with a mobile browser, you can use tools like Firefox's about:debugging page to inspect the page loaded on the mobile using the desktop developer tools.
To see which images were loaded, you can use Firefox DevTools's Network Monitor tab or Chrome DevTools's Network panel. For Chrome, you may also want to disable cache to prevent it from picking already downloaded images.

Older browsers that don't support these features will just ignore them. Instead, those browsers will go ahead and load the image referenced in the src attribute as normal.

Note:
In the <head> of the example linked above, you'll find the line <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">: this forces mobile browsers to adopt their real viewport width for loading web pages (some mobile browsers lie about their viewport width, and instead load pages at a larger viewport width then shrink the loaded page down, which is not very helpful for responsive images or design).
Resolution switching: Same size, different resolutionsSuppose you have an image that will be rendered at the same real-world size on displays that have different screen resolutions. You can provide a better user experience on high resolution displays by serving a higher resolution version of the image.
To achieve this you can allow the browser to choose an appropriate resolution image by using srcset with x-descriptors and without sizes — a somewhat easier syntax! You can find an example of what this looks like in srcset-resolutions.html (see also the source code):
html<img
  srcset="elva-fairy-320w.jpg, elva-fairy-480w.jpg 1.5x, elva-fairy-640w.jpg 2x"
  src="elva-fairy-640w.jpg"
  alt="Elva dressed as a fairy" />

Note that even though the image is always displayed with the same size, on higher resolution displays you get to see more details.

In this example, the following CSS is applied to the image so that it will have a width of 320 pixels on the screen (also called CSS pixels):
cssimg {
  width: 320px;
}

In this case, sizes is not needed — the browser works out what resolution the display is that it is being shown on, and serves the most appropriate image referenced in the srcset. So if the device accessing the page has a standard/low resolution display, with one device pixel representing each CSS pixel, the elva-fairy-320w.jpg image will be loaded (the 1x is implied, so you don't need to include it.) If the device has a high resolution of two device pixels per CSS pixel or more, the elva-fairy-640w.jpg image will be loaded. The 640px image is 93KB, whereas the 320px image is only 39KB.Art directionTo recap, the art direction problem involves wanting to change the image displayed to suit different image display sizes. For example, a web page includes a large landscape shot with a person in the middle when viewed on a desktop browser. When viewed on a mobile browser, that same image is shrunk down, making the person in the image very small and hard to see. It would probably be better to show a smaller, portrait image on mobile, which zooms in on the person. The <picture> element allows us to implement just this kind of solution.
Returning to our original not-responsive.html example, we have an image that badly needs art direction:
html<img src="elva-800w.jpg" alt="Chris standing up holding his daughter Elva" />

Let's fix this, with <picture>! Like <video> and <audio>, the <picture> element is a wrapper containing several <source> elements that provide different sources for the browser to choose from, followed by the all-important <img> element. The code in responsive.html looks like so:
html<picture>
  <source media="(max-width: 799px)" srcset="elva-480w-close-portrait.jpg" />
  <source media="(min-width: 800px)" srcset="elva-800w.jpg" />
  <img src="elva-800w.jpg" alt="Chris standing up holding his daughter Elva" />
</picture>


The <source> elements include a media attribute that contains a media condition — as with the first srcset example, these conditions are tests that decide which image is shown — the first one that returns true will be displayed. In this case, if the viewport width is 799px wide or less, the first <source> element's image will be displayed. If the viewport width is 800px or more, it'll be the second one.
The srcset attributes contain the path to the image to display. Just as we saw with <img> above, <source> can take a srcset attribute with multiple images referenced, as well as a sizes attribute. So, you could offer multiple images via a <picture> element, but then also offer multiple resolutions of each one. Realistically, you probably won't want to do this kind of thing very often.
In all cases, you must provide an <img> element, with src and alt, right before </picture>, otherwise no images will appear. This provides a default case that will apply when none of the media conditions return true (you could actually remove the second <source> element in this example), and a fallback for browsers that don't support the <picture> element.

This code allows us to display a suitable image on both wide screen and narrow screen displays, as shown below:


Note:
You should use the media attribute only in art direction scenarios; when you do use media, don't also offer media conditions within the sizes attribute.
Why can't we just do this using CSS or JavaScript?When the browser starts to load a page, it starts to download (preload) any images before the main parser has started to load and interpret the page's CSS and JavaScript. That mechanism is useful in general for reducing page load times, but it is not helpful for responsive images — hence the need to implement solutions like srcset. For example, you couldn't load the <img> element, then detect the viewport width with JavaScript, and then dynamically change the source image to a smaller one if desired. By then, the original image would already have been loaded, and you would load the small image as well, which is even worse in responsive image terms.Active learning: Implementing your own responsive imagesFor this active learning, we're expecting you to be brave and do it alone, mostly. We want you to implement your own suitable art-directed narrow screen/wide screenshot using <picture>, and a resolution switching example that uses srcset.

Write some HTML to contain your code (use not-responsive.html as a starting point, if you like).
Find a nice wide screen landscape image with some kind of detail contained in it somewhere. Create a web-sized version of it using a graphics editor, then crop it to show a smaller part that zooms in on the detail, and create a second image (about 480px wide is good for this).
Use the <picture> element to implement an art direction picture switcher!
Create multiple image files of different sizes, each showing the same picture.
Use srcset/sizes to create a resolution switcher example, either to serve the same size image at different resolutions depending on the device resolution or to serve different image sizes depending on the viewport widths.
SummaryThat's a wrap for responsive images — we hope you enjoyed playing with these new techniques. As a recap, there are two distinct problems we've been discussing here:

Art direction: The problem whereby you want to serve cropped images for different layouts — for example a landscape image showing a full scene for a desktop layout, and a portrait image showing the main subject zoomed in for a mobile layout. You can solve this problem using the <picture> element.
Resolution switching: The problem whereby you want to serve smaller image files to narrow-screen devices, as they don't need huge images like desktop displays do — and to serve different resolution images to high density/low density screens. You can solve this problem using vector graphics (SVG images) and the srcset with sizes attributes.

The 640px image is 93KB, whereas the 320px image is only 39KB.Art directionTo recap, the art direction problem involves wanting to change the image displayed to suit different image display sizes. For example, a web page includes a large landscape shot with a person in the middle when viewed on a desktop browser. When viewed on a mobile browser, that same image is shrunk down, making the person in the image very small and hard to see. It would probably be better to show a smaller, portrait image on mobile, which zooms in on the person. The <picture> element allows us to implement just this kind of solution.
Returning to our original not-responsive.html example, we have an image that badly needs art direction:
html<img src="elva-800w.jpg" alt="Chris standing up holding his daughter Elva" />

Let's fix this, with <picture>! Like <video> and <audio>, the <picture> element is a wrapper containing several <source> elements that provide different sources for the browser to choose from, followed by the all-important <img> element. The code in responsive.html looks like so:
html<picture>
  <source media="(max-width: 799px)" srcset="elva-480w-close-portrait.jpg" />
  <source media="(min-width: 800px)" srcset="elva-800w.jpg" />
  <img src="elva-800w.jpg" alt="Chris standing up holding his daughter Elva" />
</picture>


The <source> elements include a media attribute that contains a media condition — as with the first srcset example, these conditions are tests that decide which image is shown — the first one that returns true will be displayed. In this case, if the viewport width is 799px wide or less, the first <source> element's image will be displayed. If the viewport width is 800px or more, it'll be the second one.
The srcset attributes contain the path to the image to display. Just as we saw with <img> above, <source> can take a srcset attribute with multiple images referenced, as well as a sizes attribute. So, you could offer multiple images via a <picture> element, but then also offer multiple resolutions of each one. Realistically, you probably won't want to do this kind of thing very often.
In all cases, you must provide an <img> element, with src and alt, right before </picture>, otherwise no images will appear. This provides a default case that will apply when none of the media conditions return true (you could actually remove the second <source> element in this example), and a fallback for browsers that don't support the <picture> element.

This code allows us to display a suitable image on both wide screen and narrow screen displays, as shown below:


Note:
You should use the media attribute only in art direction scenarios; when you do use media, don't also offer media conditions within the sizes attribute.
Why can't we just do this using CSS or JavaScript?When the browser starts to load a page, it starts to download (preload) any images before the main parser has started to load and interpret the page's CSS and JavaScript. That mechanism is useful in general for reducing page load times, but it is not helpful for responsive images — hence the need to implement solutions like srcset. For example, you couldn't load the <img> element, then detect the viewport width with JavaScript, and then dynamically change the source image to a smaller one if desired. By then, the original image would already have been loaded, and you would load the small image as well, which is even worse in responsive image terms.Active learning: Implementing your own responsive imagesFor this active learning, we're expecting you to be brave and do it alone, mostly. We want you to implement your own suitable art-directed narrow screen/wide screenshot using <picture>, and a resolution switching example that uses srcset.

Write some HTML to contain your code (use not-responsive.html as a starting point, if you like).
Find a nice wide screen landscape image with some kind of detail contained in it somewhere. Create a web-sized version of it using a graphics editor, then crop it to show a smaller part that zooms in on the detail, and create a second image (about 480px wide is good for this).
Use the <picture> element to implement an art direction picture switcher!
Create multiple image files of different sizes, each showing the same picture.
Use srcset/sizes to create a resolution switcher example, either to serve the same size image at different resolutions depending on the device resolution or to serve different image sizes depending on the viewport widths.
SummaryThat's a wrap for responsive images — we hope you enjoyed playing with these new techniques. As a recap, there are two distinct problems we've been discussing here:

Art direction: The problem whereby you want to serve cropped images for different layouts — for example a landscape image showing a full scene for a desktop layout, and a portrait image showing the main subject zoomed in for a mobile layout. You can solve this problem using the <picture> element.
Resolution switching: The problem whereby you want to serve smaller image files to narrow-screen devices, as they don't need huge images like desktop displays do — and to serve different resolution images to high density/low density screens. You can solve this problem using vector graphics (SVG images) and the srcset with sizes attributes.

This helps to improve performance across different devices.Why responsive images?Let's examine a typical scenario. A typical website may contain a header image and some content images below the header. The header image will likely span the whole of the width of the header, and the content image will fit somewhere inside the content column. Here's an example:

This works well on a wide screen device, such as a laptop or desktop (you can see the example live and find the source code on GitHub.) We won't discuss the CSS much in this lesson, except to say that:

The body content has been set to a maximum width of 1200 pixels — in viewports above that width, the body remains at 1200px and centers itself in the available space. In viewports below that width, the body will stay at 100% of the width of the viewport.
The header image has been set so that its center always stays in the center of the header, no matter what width the heading is set at. If the site is being viewed on a narrower screen, the important detail in the center of the image (the people) can still be seen, and the excess is lost off either side. It is 200px high.
The content images have been set so that if the body element becomes smaller than the image, the images start to shrink so that they always stay inside the body, rather than overflowing it.

However, issues arise when you start to view the site on a narrow screen device. The header below looks OK, but it's starting to take up a lot of the screen height for a mobile device. And at this size, it is difficult to see faces of the two people within the first content image.

An improvement would be to display a cropped version of the image which displays the important details of the image when the site is viewed on a narrow screen. A second cropped image could be displayed for a medium-width screen device, like a tablet. The general problem whereby you want to serve different cropped images in that way, for various layouts, is commonly known as the art direction problem.
In addition, there is no need to embed such large images on the page if it is being viewed on a mobile screen. Doing so can waste bandwidth; in particular, mobile users don't want to waste bandwidth by downloading a large image intended for desktop users, when a small image would do for their device. Conversely, a small raster image starts to look grainy when displayed larger than its original size (a raster image is a set number of pixels wide and a set number of pixels tall). Ideally, multiple resolutions would be made available to the user's web browser. The browser could then determine the optimal resolution to load based on the screen size of the user's device. This is called the resolution switching problem.
To make things more complicated, some devices have high resolution screens that need larger images than you might expect to display nicely. This is essentially the same problem, but in a slightly different context.
You might think that vector images would solve these problems, and they do to a certain degree — they are small in file size and scale well, and you should use them wherever possible. However, they aren't suitable for all image types. Vector images are great for simple graphics, patterns, interface elements, etc., but it starts to get very complex to create a vector-based image with the kind of detail that you'd find in say, a photo. Raster image formats such as JPEGs are more suited to the kind of images we see in the above example.
This kind of problem didn't exist when the web first existed, in the early to mid 90s — back then the only devices in existence to browse the Web were desktops and laptops, so browser engineers and spec writers didn't even think to implement solutions. Responsive image technologies were implemented recently to solve the problems indicated above by letting you offer the browser several image files, either all showing the same thing but containing different numbers of pixels (resolution switching), or different images suitable for different space allocations (art direction).

Note:
The new features discussed in this article — srcset/sizes/<picture> — are all supported in modern desktop and mobile browsers.
How do you create responsive images?In this section, we'll look at the two problems illustrated above and show how to solve them using HTML's responsive image features. You should note that we will be focusing on <img> elements for this section, as seen in the content area of the example above — the image in the site header is only for decoration, and therefore implemented using CSS background images. CSS arguably has better tools for responsive design than HTML, and we'll talk about those in a future CSS module.Resolution switching: Different sizesSo, what is the problem that we want to solve with resolution switching? We want to display identical image content, just larger or smaller depending on the device — this is the situation we have with the second content image in our example. The standard <img> element traditionally only lets you point the browser to a single source file:
html<img src="elva-fairy-800w.jpg" alt="Elva dressed as a fairy" />

We can however use two attributes — srcset and sizes — to provide several additional source images along with hints to help the browser pick the right one. You can see an example of this in our responsive.html example on GitHub (see also the source code):
html<img
  srcset="elva-fairy-480w.jpg 480w, elva-fairy-800w.jpg 800w"
  sizes="(max-width: 600px) 480px,
         800px"
  src="elva-fairy-800w.jpg"
  alt="Elva dressed as a fairy" />

The srcset and sizes attributes look complicated, but they're not too hard to understand if you format them as shown above, with a different part of the attribute value on each line. Each value contains a comma-separated list, and each part of those lists is made up of three sub-parts. Let's run through the contents of each now:
srcset defines the set of images we will allow the browser to choose between, and what size each image is. Each set of image information is separated from the previous one by a comma. For each one, we write:

An image filename (elva-fairy-480w.jpg)
A space
The image's intrinsic width in pixels (480w) — note that this uses the w unit, not px as you might expect. An image's intrinsic size is its real size, which can be found by inspecting the image file on your computer (for example, on a Mac you can select the image in Finder and press Cmd + I to bring up the info screen).

sizes defines a set of media conditions (e.g., screen widths) and indicates what image size would be best to choose, when certain media conditions are true — these are the hints we talked about earlier. In this case, before each comma we write:

A media condition ((max-width:600px)) — you'll learn more about these in the CSS topic, but for now let's just say that a media condition describes a possible state that the screen can be in. In this case, we are saying "when the viewport width is 600 pixels or less".
A space
The width of the slot the image will fill when the media condition is true (480px)


Note:
In sizes, you can use any length value. For example, rather than providing an absolute width (for example, 480px), you can alternatively provide a width relative to the viewport (for example, 50vw). However, you cannot use a percentage as the slot width. You may have noticed that the last slot width has no media condition (this is the default that is chosen when none of the media conditions are true). The browser ignores everything after the first matching condition, so be careful how you order the media conditions.

So, with these attributes in place, the browser will:

Look at screen size, pixel density, zoom level, screen orientation, and network speed.
Work out which media condition in the sizes list is the first one to be true.
Look at the slot size given to that media query.
Load the image referenced in the srcset list that has the same size as the slot or, if there isn't one, the first image that is bigger than the chosen slot size.

And that's it! At this point, if a supporting browser with a viewport width of 480px loads the page, the (max-width: 600px) media condition will be true, and so the browser chooses the 480px slot. The elva-fairy-480w.jpg will be loaded, as its inherent width (480w) is closest to the slot size. The 800px picture is 128KB on disk, whereas the 480px version is only 63KB — a saving of 65KB. Now, imagine if this was a page that had many pictures on it. Using this technique could save mobile users a lot of bandwidth.

Note:
When testing this with a desktop browser, if the browser fails to load the narrower images when you've got its window set to the narrowest width, have a look at what the viewport is (you can approximate it by going into the browser's JavaScript console and typing in document.querySelector('html').clientWidth). Different browsers have minimum sizes that they'll let you reduce the window width to, and they might be wider than you'd think. When testing it with a mobile browser, you can use tools like Firefox's about:debugging page to inspect the page loaded on the mobile using the desktop developer tools.
To see which images were loaded, you can use Firefox DevTools's Network Monitor tab or Chrome DevTools's Network panel. For Chrome, you may also want to disable cache to prevent it from picking already downloaded images.

Older browsers that don't support these features will just ignore them. Instead, those browsers will go ahead and load the image referenced in the src attribute as normal.

Note:
In the <head> of the example linked above, you'll find the line <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">: this forces mobile browsers to adopt their real viewport width for loading web pages (some mobile browsers lie about their viewport width, and instead load pages at a larger viewport width then shrink the loaded page down, which is not very helpful for responsive images or design).
Resolution switching: Same size, different resolutionsSuppose you have an image that will be rendered at the same real-world size on displays that have different screen resolutions. You can provide a better user experience on high resolution displays by serving a higher resolution version of the image.
To achieve this you can allow the browser to choose an appropriate resolution image by using srcset with x-descriptors and without sizes — a somewhat easier syntax! You can find an example of what this looks like in srcset-resolutions.html (see also the source code):
html<img
  srcset="elva-fairy-320w.jpg, elva-fairy-480w.jpg 1.5x, elva-fairy-640w.jpg 2x"
  src="elva-fairy-640w.jpg"
  alt="Elva dressed as a fairy" />

Note that even though the image is always displayed with the same size, on higher resolution displays you get to see more details.

In this example, the following CSS is applied to the image so that it will have a width of 320 pixels on the screen (also called CSS pixels):
cssimg {
  width: 320px;
}

In this case, sizes is not needed — the browser works out what resolution the display is that it is being shown on, and serves the most appropriate image referenced in the srcset. So if the device accessing the page has a standard/low resolution display, with one device pixel representing each CSS pixel, the elva-fairy-320w.jpg image will be loaded (the 1x is implied, so you don't need to include it.) If the device has a high resolution of two device pixels per CSS pixel or more, the elva-fairy-640w.jpg image will be loaded. The 640px image is 93KB, whereas the 320px image is only 39KB.Art directionTo recap, the art direction problem involves wanting to change the image displayed to suit different image display sizes. For example, a web page includes a large landscape shot with a person in the middle when viewed on a desktop browser. When viewed on a mobile browser, that same image is shrunk down, making the person in the image very small and hard to see. It would probably be better to show a smaller, portrait image on mobile, which zooms in on the person. The <picture> element allows us to implement just this kind of solution.

html<img src="elva-800w.jpg" alt="Chris standing up holding his daughter Elva" />

  <source media="(min-width: 800px)" srcset="elva-800w.jpg" />
  <img src="elva-800w.jpg" alt="Chris standing up holding his daughter Elva" />
</picture>


The <source> elements include a media attribute that contains a media condition — as with the first srcset example, these conditions are tests that decide which image is shown — the first one that returns true will be displayed. In this case, if the viewport width is 799px wide or less, the first <source> element's image will be displayed. If the viewport width is 800px or more, it'll be the second one.

Search engines and web crawlers can extract and process microdata from a web page and use it to provide a richer browsing experience for users. Search engines benefit greatly from direct access to this structured data because it allows search engines to understand the information on web pages and provide more relevant results to users. Microdata uses a supporting vocabulary to describe an item and name-value pairs to assign values to its properties. Microdata is an attempt to provide a declarative way of annotating HTML elements with machine-readable tags than the similar approaches of using RDFa and classic microformats.
At a high level, microdata consists of a group of name-value pairs. The groups are called items, and each name-value pair is a property. Items and properties are represented by regular elements.

To create an item, the itemscope attribute is used.
To add a property to an item, the itemprop attribute is used on one of the item's descendants.
VocabulariesGoogle and other major search engines support the Schema.org vocabulary for structured data.

In this case, Schema.org Music Event would be the URL used by itemtype and startDate and location would be itemprop's that Schema.org Music Event defines.

Note:

Microdata vocabularies provide the semantics or meaning of an Item. Web developers can design a custom vocabulary or use vocabularies available on the web, such as the widely used schema.org vocabulary. A collection of commonly used markup vocabularies are provided by Schema.org.

For others, a vocabulary will need to be designed. Where possible, authors are encouraged to re-use existing vocabularies, as this makes content re-use easier.LocalizationIn some cases, search engines covering specific regions may provide locally-specific extensions of microdata. For example, Yandex, a major search engine in Russia, supports microformats such as hCard (company contact information), hRecipe (food recipe), hReview (market reviews) and hProduct (product data) and provides its own format for the definition of the terms and encyclopedic articles. This extension was made to solve transliteration problems between the Cyrillic and Latin alphabets. Due to the implementation of additional marking parameters of Schema's vocabulary, the indexation of information in Russian-language web-pages became considerably more successful.Global attributesitemid – The unique, global identifier of an item.
itemprop – Used to add properties to an item. Every HTML element may have an itemprop attribute specified, where an itemprop consists of a name and value pair.
itemref – Properties that are not descendants of an element with the itemscope attribute can be associated with the item using an itemref. itemref provides a list of element ids (not itemids) with additional properties elsewhere in the document.
itemscope – The itemscope attribute (usually) works along with itemtype to specify that the HTML contained in a block is about a particular item. The itemscope attribute creates the Item and defines the scope of the itemtype associated with it. The itemtype attribute is a valid URL of a vocabulary (such as schema.org) that describes the item and its properties context.
itemtype – Specifies the URL of the vocabulary that will be used to define itemprop's (item properties) in the data structure.

itemref – Properties that are not descendants of an element with the itemscope attribute can be associated with the item using an itemref. itemref provides a list of element ids (not itemids) with additional properties elsewhere in the document.
itemscope – The itemscope attribute (usually) works along with itemtype to specify that the HTML contained in a block is about a particular item. The itemscope attribute creates the Item and defines the scope of the itemtype associated with it. The itemtype attribute is a valid URL of a vocabulary (such as schema.org) that describes the item and its properties context.
itemtype – Specifies the URL of the vocabulary that will be used to define itemprop's (item properties) in the data structure. The itemscope attribute is used to set the scope of where in the data structure the vocabulary set by itemtype will be active.ExampleHTMLhtml<div itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/SoftwareApplication">

Search engines and web crawlers can extract and process microdata from a web page and use it to provide a richer browsing experience for users. Search engines benefit greatly from direct access to this structured data because it allows search engines to understand the information on web pages and provide more relevant results to users. Microdata uses a supporting vocabulary to describe an item and name-value pairs to assign values to its properties. Microdata is an attempt to provide a declarative way of annotating HTML elements with machine-readable tags than the similar approaches of using RDFa and classic microformats.
At a high level, microdata consists of a group of name-value pairs. The groups are called items, and each name-value pair is a property. Items and properties are represented by regular elements.

To create an item, the itemscope attribute is used.
To add a property to an item, the itemprop attribute is used on one of the item's descendants.
VocabulariesGoogle and other major search engines support the Schema.org vocabulary for structured data. This vocabulary defines a standard set of type names and property names, for example, Schema.org Music Event indicates a concert performance, with startDate and location properties to specify the concert's key details. In this case, Schema.org Music Event would be the URL used by itemtype and startDate and location would be itemprop's that Schema.org Music Event defines.

Note:
More about itemtype attributes can be found at https://schema.org/Thing.

Microdata vocabularies provide the semantics or meaning of an Item. Web developers can design a custom vocabulary or use vocabularies available on the web, such as the widely used schema.org vocabulary. A collection of commonly used markup vocabularies are provided by Schema.org.
Commonly used vocabularies:

Creative works: CreativeWork, Book, Movie, MusicRecording, Recipe, TVSeries
Embedded non-text objects: AudioObject, ImageObject, VideoObject
Event
Health and medical types: Notes on the health and medical types under MedicalEntity
Organization
Person
Place, LocalBusiness, Restaurant
Product, Offer, AggregateOffer
Review, AggregateRating
Action
Thing
Intangible

Major search engine operators like Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo! rely on the schema.org vocabulary to improve search results. For some purposes, an ad hoc vocabulary is adequate. For others, a vocabulary will need to be designed. Where possible, authors are encouraged to re-use existing vocabularies, as this makes content re-use easier.LocalizationIn some cases, search engines covering specific regions may provide locally-specific extensions of microdata. For example, Yandex, a major search engine in Russia, supports microformats such as hCard (company contact information), hRecipe (food recipe), hReview (market reviews) and hProduct (product data) and provides its own format for the definition of the terms and encyclopedic articles. This extension was made to solve transliteration problems between the Cyrillic and Latin alphabets. Due to the implementation of additional marking parameters of Schema's vocabulary, the indexation of information in Russian-language web-pages became considerably more successful.Global attributesitemid – The unique, global identifier of an item.

Help improve MDNWas this page helpful to you?YesNoLearn how to contribute.This page was last modified on Apr 10, 2025 by MDN contributors.View this page on GitHub • Report a problem with this content\n\n\n\nUsing microformats in HTMLMicroformats are standards used to embed semantics and structured data in HTML, and provide an API to be used by social web applications, search engines, aggregators, and other tools. These minimal patterns of HTML are used for marking up entities that range from fundamental to domain-specific information, such as people, organizations, events, and locations.

To create a microformats object, h-* class names are used in the class attribute.
To add a property to an object, the p-*, u-*, dt-*, e-* class names are used on one of the object's descendants.

Microformats use supporting vocabularies to describe objects and name-value pairs to assign values to their properties. The properties are carried in class attributes that can be added to any HTML element, while the data values re-use HTML element content and semantic attributes.
Microformats2 (sometimes referred to as mf2) is an update to microformats that provides a method of annotating HTML structured syntax and vocabularies than previous approaches of using RDFa and microdata. These previous approaches require learning new attributes.
There are open source parsing libraries for most languages for microformats2.How Microformats WorkAn author of a webpage can add microformats to their HTML. For example if they wanted to identify themselves they could use an h-card such as:HTML Examplehtml<a class="h-card" href="https://alice.example.com">Alice Blogger</a>

When a parser encounters this data, it will know that this page contains a "card" which describes a person or organization named Alice Blogger with a URL of https://alice.example.com/. The parser makes this data available via APIs that can be used for different applications. For example, an application could scan a page for a h-card to use as profile information for someone who has signed up to a service.
As in this example, some markup patterns require only a single microformat root class name, which parsers use to find a few generic properties such as name, url, photo.Microformats Use CasesMicroformats have numerous use cases. First, the Webmention standard uses microformats to provide a way in which messages and comments can be sent from one site to another. The Webmention specification defines specific attributes that sites may publish and consume to create a rich, interoperable way of publishing messages and comments. Microformats can also be used with Webmentions to enable sending social reactions such as likes, reposts, and bookmarks from one site to another.
Microformats also enable easy syndication across sites. An aggregator could parse a page with published microformats to look for information such as a post title, a post body, and the author of a post. This aggregator could then use the semantic information gathered to render a result on their site. For instance, news aggregators and community posting boards could facilitate submissions and use microformats to exact relevant content from a page. Further, a website could use microformats to send crafted requests to third-parties to publish content, such as social networks.
All major search engines support reading and interpreting microformats. Search engines benefit greatly from direct access to this structured data because it allows them to understand the information on web pages. With this information, search engines can provide more relevant results to users. Some search engines may render special snippets such as star ratings on a search result page based on the data provided in microformats.
In addition to being machine-readable, microformats are designed to be easily read by humans. This approach makes it easy for people to understand and maintain microformats data.Microformats PrefixesAll microformats consist of a root, and a collection of properties. Properties are all optional and potentially multivalued - applications needing a singular value may use the first instance of a property. Hierarchical data is represented with nested microformats, typically as property values themselves.
All microformats class names use prefixes. Prefixes are syntax independent of vocabularies, which are developed separately.


"h-*" for root class names, e.g., "h-card", "h-entry", "h-feed", and many more. These top-level root classes usually indicate a type and corresponding expected vocabulary of properties. For example:

h-card describes a person or organization
h-entry describes episodic or date stamped online content like a blog post
h-feed describes a stream or feed of posts
You can find many more vocabularies on the microformats2 wiki.



"p-*" for plain (text) properties, e.g., "p-name", "p-summary"

Generic plain text parsing, element text in general. On certain HTML elements, use special attributes first, e.g., img/alt, abbr/title.



"u-*" for URL properties, e.g., "u-url", "u-photo", "u-logo"

Special parsing: element attributes a/href, img/src, object/data etc. attributes over element contents.



"dt-*" for datetime properties, e.g., "dt-start", "dt-end", "dt-bday"

Special parsing: time element datetime attribute, value-class-pattern and separate date time value parsing for readability.



"e-*" for element tree properties where the entire contained element hierarchy is the value, e.g., "e-content". The "e-" prefix can also be mnemonically remembered as "element tree", "embedded markup", or "encapsulated markup".

Some microformats examplesh-cardThe h-card microformat represents a person or organization.
The value of each property is defined in HTML using the class property any element can carry
Example h-card
html<p class="h-card">
  <img class="u-photo" src="https://example.org/photo.png" alt="" />
  <a class="p-name u-url" href="https://example.org">Joe Bloggs</a>
  <a class="u-email" href="mailto:jbloggs@example.com">jbloggs@example.com</a>,
  <span class="p-street-address">17 Austerstræti</span>
  <span class="p-locality">Reykjavík</span>
  <span class="p-country-name">Iceland</span>
</p>




Property
Description




p-name
The full/formatted name of the person or organization.


u-email
email address


u-photo
a photo of the person or organization


u-url
home page or other URL representing the person or organization


u-uid
universally unique identifier, preferably canonical URL


p-street-address
street number + name


p-locality
city/town/village


p-country-name
country name



Nested h-card example
html<div class="h-card">
  <a class="p-name u-url" href="https://blog.lizardwrangler.com/">
    Mitchell Baker
  </a>
  (<a class="p-org h-card" href="https://mozilla.org/">Mozilla Foundation</a>)
</div>

Parsed JSON:
json{
  "items": [
    {
      "type": ["h-card"],
      "properties": {
        "name": ["Mitchell Baker"],
        "url": ["https://blog.lizardwrangler.com/"],
        "org": [
          {
            "value": "Mozilla Foundation",
            "type": ["h-card"],
            "properties": {
              "name": ["Mozilla Foundation"],

            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}

In this example, a h-card is specified for both a person and the organization they represent. The person's affiliation with the linked organization is specified using the p-org property.
Note: the nested h-card has implied 'name' and 'url' properties, just like any other root-class-name-only h-card on an <a href> would.h-entryThe h-entry microformat represents episodic or datestamped content on the web. h-entry is often used with content intended to be syndicated, e.g., blog posts and short notes.
Example h-entry as a blog post:
html<article class="h-entry">
  <h1 class="p-name">Microformats are amazing</h1>
  <p>

Microformats rel property examplesThere are some microformats that are applied to a page by using a special rel= property. These microformats describe a relation between a current document and a linked document. For a full list of these, see the rel property on the microformats wiki.rel=authorThis attribute states that the linked document represents the author of the current page.
html<a rel="author" href="https://jamesg.blog">James Gallagher</a>
rel=licenseThis attribute states that the linked document contains the license under which the current page is published.
html<a rel="license" href="https://mit-license.org/">MIT License</a>
rel=nofollowThis attribute states that the linked document should not be given any weight by search engine ranking algorithms that may derive from the current page. This is useful to prevent link graph algorithms from weighing a page higher than it otherwise would after seeing a link to a document.

Microformats on IndieWebCamp\n\nUsing microformats in HTMLMicroformats are standards used to embed semantics and structured data in HTML, and provide an API to be used by social web applications, search engines, aggregators, and other tools. These minimal patterns of HTML are used for marking up entities that range from fundamental to domain-specific information, such as people, organizations, events, and locations.

To create a microformats object, h-* class names are used in the class attribute.
To add a property to an object, the p-*, u-*, dt-*, e-* class names are used on one of the object's descendants.

Microformats use supporting vocabularies to describe objects and name-value pairs to assign values to their properties. The properties are carried in class attributes that can be added to any HTML element, while the data values re-use HTML element content and semantic attributes.
Microformats2 (sometimes referred to as mf2) is an update to microformats that provides a method of annotating HTML structured syntax and vocabularies than previous approaches of using RDFa and microdata. These previous approaches require learning new attributes.
There are open source parsing libraries for most languages for microformats2.How Microformats WorkAn author of a webpage can add microformats to their HTML. For example if they wanted to identify themselves they could use an h-card such as:HTML Examplehtml<a class="h-card" href="https://alice.example.com">Alice Blogger</a>

When a parser encounters this data, it will know that this page contains a "card" which describes a person or organization named Alice Blogger with a URL of https://alice.example.com/. The parser makes this data available via APIs that can be used for different applications. For example, an application could scan a page for a h-card to use as profile information for someone who has signed up to a service.
As in this example, some markup patterns require only a single microformat root class name, which parsers use to find a few generic properties such as name, url, photo.Microformats Use CasesMicroformats have numerous use cases. First, the Webmention standard uses microformats to provide a way in which messages and comments can be sent from one site to another. The Webmention specification defines specific attributes that sites may publish and consume to create a rich, interoperable way of publishing messages and comments. Microformats can also be used with Webmentions to enable sending social reactions such as likes, reposts, and bookmarks from one site to another.
Microformats also enable easy syndication across sites. An aggregator could parse a page with published microformats to look for information such as a post title, a post body, and the author of a post. This aggregator could then use the semantic information gathered to render a result on their site. For instance, news aggregators and community posting boards could facilitate submissions and use microformats to exact relevant content from a page. Further, a website could use microformats to send crafted requests to third-parties to publish content, such as social networks.
All major search engines support reading and interpreting microformats. Search engines benefit greatly from direct access to this structured data because it allows them to understand the information on web pages. With this information, search engines can provide more relevant results to users. Some search engines may render special snippets such as star ratings on a search result page based on the data provided in microformats.
In addition to being machine-readable, microformats are designed to be easily read by humans. This approach makes it easy for people to understand and maintain microformats data.Microformats PrefixesAll microformats consist of a root, and a collection of properties. Properties are all optional and potentially multivalued - applications needing a singular value may use the first instance of a property. Hierarchical data is represented with nested microformats, typically as property values themselves.
All microformats class names use prefixes. Prefixes are syntax independent of vocabularies, which are developed separately.


"h-*" for root class names, e.g., "h-card", "h-entry", "h-feed", and many more. These top-level root classes usually indicate a type and corresponding expected vocabulary of properties. For example:

h-card describes a person or organization
h-entry describes episodic or date stamped online content like a blog post
h-feed describes a stream or feed of posts
You can find many more vocabularies on the microformats2 wiki.



"p-*" for plain (text) properties, e.g., "p-name", "p-summary"

Generic plain text parsing, element text in general. On certain HTML elements, use special attributes first, e.g., img/alt, abbr/title.



"u-*" for URL properties, e.g., "u-url", "u-photo", "u-logo"

Special parsing: element attributes a/href, img/src, object/data etc. attributes over element contents.



"dt-*" for datetime properties, e.g., "dt-start", "dt-end", "dt-bday"

Special parsing: time element datetime attribute, value-class-pattern and separate date time value parsing for readability.



"e-*" for element tree properties where the entire contained element hierarchy is the value, e.g., "e-content". The "e-" prefix can also be mnemonically remembered as "element tree", "embedded markup", or "encapsulated markup".

Some microformats examplesh-cardThe h-card microformat represents a person or organization.
The value of each property is defined in HTML using the class property any element can carry
Example h-card
html<p class="h-card">
  <img class="u-photo" src="https://example.org/photo.png" alt="" />
  <a class="p-name u-url" href="https://example.org">Joe Bloggs</a>
  <a class="u-email" href="mailto:jbloggs@example.com">jbloggs@example.com</a>,
  <span class="p-street-address">17 Austerstræti</span>
  <span class="p-locality">Reykjavík</span>
  <span class="p-country-name">Iceland</span>
</p>




Property
Description




p-name
The full/formatted name of the person or organization.


u-email
email address


u-photo
a photo of the person or organization


u-url
home page or other URL representing the person or organization


u-uid
universally unique identifier, preferably canonical URL


p-street-address
street number + name


p-locality
city/town/village


p-country-name
country name



Nested h-card example
html<div class="h-card">
  <a class="p-name u-url" href="https://blog.lizardwrangler.com/">
    Mitchell Baker
  </a>
  (<a class="p-org h-card" href="https://mozilla.org/">Mozilla Foundation</a>)
</div>

Parsed JSON:
json{
  "items": [
    {
      "type": ["h-card"],
      "properties": {
        "name": ["Mitchell Baker"],
        "url": ["https://blog.lizardwrangler.com/"],
        "org": [
          {
            "value": "Mozilla Foundation",

            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}

In this example, a h-card is specified for both a person and the organization they represent. The person's affiliation with the linked organization is specified using the p-org property.
Note: the nested h-card has implied 'name' and 'url' properties, just like any other root-class-name-only h-card on an <a href> would.h-entryThe h-entry microformat represents episodic or datestamped content on the web. h-entry is often used with content intended to be syndicated, e.g., blog posts and short notes.
Example h-entry as a blog post:
html<article class="h-entry">

"e-*" for element tree properties where the entire contained element hierarchy is the value, e.g., "e-content". The "e-" prefix can also be mnemonically remembered as "element tree", "embedded markup", or "encapsulated markup".

Some microformats examplesh-cardThe h-card microformat represents a person or organization.
The value of each property is defined in HTML using the class property any element can carry
Example h-card
html<p class="h-card">
  <img class="u-photo" src="https://example.org/photo.png" alt="" />
  <a class="p-name u-url" href="https://example.org">Joe Bloggs</a>
  <a class="u-email" href="mailto:jbloggs@example.com">jbloggs@example.com</a>,
  <span class="p-street-address">17 Austerstræti</span>
  <span class="p-locality">Reykjavík</span>
  <span class="p-country-name">Iceland</span>

Property
Description




p-name
The full/formatted name of the person or organization.


u-email
email address


u-photo
a photo of the person or organization


u-url
home page or other URL representing the person or organization


u-uid
universally unique identifier, preferably canonical URL


p-street-address

  <a class="p-name u-url" href="https://blog.lizardwrangler.com/">
    Mitchell Baker
  </a>
  (<a class="p-org h-card" href="https://mozilla.org/">Mozilla Foundation</a>)

In this example, a h-card is specified for both a person and the organization they represent. The person's affiliation with the linked organization is specified using the p-org property.
Note: the nested h-card has implied 'name' and 'url' properties, just like any other root-class-name-only h-card on an <a href> would.h-entryThe h-entry microformat represents episodic or datestamped content on the web. h-entry is often used with content intended to be syndicated, e.g., blog posts and short notes.
Example h-entry as a blog post:

Microformats rel property examplesThere are some microformats that are applied to a page by using a special rel= property. These microformats describe a relation between a current document and a linked document. For a full list of these, see the rel property on the microformats wiki.rel=authorThis attribute states that the linked document represents the author of the current page.
html<a rel="author" href="https://jamesg.blog">James Gallagher</a>
rel=licenseThis attribute states that the linked document contains the license under which the current page is published.
html<a rel="license" href="https://mit-license.org/">MIT License</a>
rel=nofollowThis attribute states that the linked document should not be given any weight by search engine ranking algorithms that may derive from the current page. This is useful to prevent link graph algorithms from weighing a page higher than it otherwise would after seeing a link to a document.
html<a rel="nofollow" href="https://jamesg.blog">James Gallagher</a>

When the web standards were made at W3C, browsers could not just start using them, as doing so would break most existing sites on the web. Browsers therefore introduced two modes to treat new standards compliant sites differently from old legacy sites.
There are now three modes used by the layout engines in web browsers: quirks mode, limited-quirks mode, and no-quirks mode. In quirks mode, layout emulates behavior in Navigator 4 and Internet Explorer 5. This is essential in order to support websites that were built before the widespread adoption of web standards. In no-quirks mode, the behavior is (hopefully) the desired behavior described by the modern HTML and CSS specifications. In limited-quirks mode, there are only a very small number of quirks implemented.
The limited-quirks and no-quirks modes used to be called "almost-standards" mode and "full standards" mode, respectively. These names have been changed as the behavior is now standardized.How do browsers determine which mode to use?For HTML documents, browsers use a doctype in the beginning of the document to decide whether to handle it in quirks mode or standards mode. To ensure that your page uses full standards mode, make sure that your page has a doctype like in this example:
html<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>Hello World!</title>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>

The doctype shown in the example, <!doctype html>, is the simplest possible, and the one recommended by current HTML standards. Earlier versions of the HTML standard recommended other variants, but all existing browsers today will use full standards mode for this doctype. There are no valid reasons to use a more complicated doctype. If you do use another doctype, you may risk choosing one which triggers almost standards mode or quirks mode.
Put the doctype right at the beginning of your HTML document, before any other content.
The only purpose of <!doctype html> is to activate no-quirks mode. Older versions of HTML standard doctypes provided additional meaning, but no browser ever used the doctype for anything other than switching between render modes.
See also a detailed description of when different browsers choose various modes.XHTMLIf you serve your page as XHTML using the application/xhtml+xml MIME type in the Content-Type HTTP header, you do not need a doctype to enable standards mode, as such documents always use 'full standards mode'.
If you serve XHTML-like content using the text/html MIME type, browsers will read it as HTML, and you will need the doctype to use standards mode.How do I see which mode is used?If the page is rendered in quirks or limited-quirks mode, Firefox will log a warning to the console tab in the developer tools. If this warning is not shown, Firefox is using no-quirks mode.
The value of document.compatMode in JavaScript will show whether or not the document is in quirks mode. If its value is "BackCompat", the document is in quirks mode. If it isn't, it will have value "CSS1Compat".\n\nUnderstanding quirks and standards modesIn the old days of the web, pages were typically written in two versions: One for Netscape Navigator, and one for Microsoft Internet Explorer.

MDN provides you with extended HTML reference documentation as well as a deep instructional set of HTML guides. However, in many cases we just need some quick hints as we go. That's the whole purpose of the cheat sheet, to give you some quick accurate ready to use code snippets for common usages.

Note:
HTML tags must be used for their semantic value, not their appearance. It's always possible to totally change the look and feel of a given tag using CSS so, when using HTML, take the time to focus on the meaning rather than the appearance.
Inline elementsAn "element" is a single part of a webpage. Some elements are large and hold smaller elements like containers. Some elements are small and are "nested" inside larger ones. By default, "inline elements" appear next to one another in a webpage. They take up only as much width as they need in a page and fit together horizontally like words in a sentence or books shelved side-by-side in a row. All inline elements can be placed within the <body> element.

MDN provides you with extended HTML reference documentation as well as a deep instructional set of HTML guides. However, in many cases we just need some quick hints as we go. That's the whole purpose of the cheat sheet, to give you some quick accurate ready to use code snippets for common usages.

Note:
HTML tags must be used for their semantic value, not their appearance. It's always possible to totally change the look and feel of a given tag using CSS so, when using HTML, take the time to focus on the meaning rather than the appearance.
Inline elementsAn "element" is a single part of a webpage. Some elements are large and hold smaller elements like containers. Some elements are small and are "nested" inside larger ones. By default, "inline elements" appear next to one another in a webpage. They take up only as much width as they need in a page and fit together horizontally like words in a sentence or books shelved side-by-side in a row. All inline elements can be placed within the <body> element.

In this article, we'll cover how to properly mark up keywords when you're defining them.

  
    
      Prerequisites:
      
        You need to be familiar with how to
        create a basic HTML document.
      
    
    
      Objective:
      
        Learn how to introduce new keywords and how to build description lists.
      
    
  

When you need a term defined, you probably go straight to a dictionary or glossary. Dictionaries and glossaries formally associate keywords with one or more descriptions, as in this case:


Blue (Adjective)

Of a color like the sky in a sunny day.
"The clear blue sky"



But we're constantly defining keywords informally, as here:

Firefox is the web browser created by the Mozilla Foundation.

To deal with these use cases, HTML provides tags to mark descriptions and words described, so that your meaning gets across properly to your readers.How to mark informal descriptionIn textbooks, the first time a keyword occurs, it's common to put the keyword in bold and define it right away.
We do that in HTML too, except HTML is not a visual medium and so we don't use bold. We use <dfn>, which is a special element just for marking the first occurrence of keywords. Note that <dfn> tags go around the word to be defined, not the definition (the definition consists of the entire paragraph):
html<p><dfn>Firefox</dfn> is the web browser created by the Mozilla Foundation.</p>


Note:
Another use for bold is to emphasize content. Bold itself is a concept foreign to HTML, but there are tags for indicating emphasis.
Special case: AbbreviationsIt's best to mark abbreviations specially with <abbr>, so that screen readers read them appropriately and so that you can operate on all abbreviations uniformly. Just as with any new keyword, you should define your abbreviations the first time they occur.
html<p>
  <dfn><abbr>HTML</abbr> (hypertext markup language)</dfn>
  is a description language used to structure documents on the web.
</p>


Note:
The HTML spec does indeed set aside the title attribute for expanding the abbreviation. However, this is not an acceptable alternative for providing an inline expansion. The contents of title are completely hidden from your users, unless they're using a mouse and they happen to hover over the abbreviation. The spec duly acknowledges this as well.
Improve accessibility<dfn> marks the keyword defined, and indicates that the current paragraph defines the keyword. In other words, there's an implicit relationship between the <dfn> element and its container. If you want a more formal relationship, or your definition consists of only one sentence rather than the whole paragraph, you can use the aria-describedby attribute to associate a term more formally with its definition:
html<p>
  <span id="ff">
    <dfn aria-describedby="ff">Firefox</dfn>
    is the web browser created by the Mozilla Foundation.
  </span>
  You can download it at <a href="https://www.mozilla.org">mozilla.org</a>
</p>

Assistive technology can often use this attribute to find a text alternative to a given term. You can use aria-describedby on any tag enclosing a keyword to be defined (not just the <dfn> element). aria-describedby references the id of the element containing the description.How to build a description listDescription lists are just what they claim to be: a list of terms and their matching descriptions (e.g., definition lists, dictionary entries, FAQs, and key-value pairs).

Note:
Description lists are not suitable for marking up dialog, because conversation does not directly describe the speakers. Here are recommendations for marking up dialog.

The terms described go inside <dt> elements. The matching description follows immediately, contained within one or more <dd> elements. Enclose the whole description list with a <dl> element.A simple exampleHere's an example describing kinds of food and drink:
html<dl>
  <dt>jambalaya</dt>
  <dd>
    rice-based entree typically containing chicken, sausage, seafood, and spices
  </dd>

  <dt>sukiyaki</dt>
  <dd>
    Japanese specialty consisting of thinly sliced meat, vegetables, and
    noodles, cooked in sake and soy sauce
  </dd>

  <dt>chianti</dt>
  <dd>dry Italian red wine originating in Tuscany</dd>
</dl>


Note:
The basic pattern, as you can see, is to alternate <dt> terms with <dd> descriptions. If two or more terms occur in a row, the following description applies to all of them. If two or more descriptions occur in a row, they all apply to the last given term.
Improving the visual outputHere's how a graphical browser displays the foregoing list:

If you want the keywords to stand out better, you could try bolding them. Remember, HTML is not a visual medium; we need CSS for all visual effects. The CSS font-weight property is what you need here:
cssdt {
  font-weight: bold;
}

This produces the slightly more readable result below:

Any attribute on any element whose attribute name starts with data- is a data attribute. Say you have some articles and you want to store some extra information that doesn't have any visual representation. Just use data attributes for that:
html<main>
  <article
    id="electric-cars"
    data-columns="3"
    data-index-number="12314"
    data-parent="cars">
    <!-- Electric car content -->
  </article>

  <article
    id="solar-cars"
    data-columns="3"
    data-index-number="12315"
    data-parent="cars">
    <!-- Solar car content -->
  </article>

  <article
    id="flying-cars"
    data-columns="4"
    data-index-number="12316"
    data-parent="cars">
    <!-- Flying car content -->
  </article>
</main>
JavaScript accessReading the values of these attributes out in JavaScript is also very simple. You could use getAttribute() with their full HTML name to read them, but the standard defines a simpler way: a DOMStringMap you can read out via a dataset property.
To get a data attribute through the dataset object, get the property by the part of the attribute name after data- (note that dashes are converted to camel case).
jsconst article = document.querySelector("#electric-cars");
// The following would also work:
// const article = document.getElementById("electric-cars")

article.dataset.columns; // "3"
article.dataset.indexNumber; // "12314"
article.dataset.parent; // "cars"

Each property is a string and can be read and written. In the above case setting article.dataset.columns = 5 would change that attribute to "5".
You can also use document.querySelector() or document.querySelectorAll() with data attribute selectors to find one element or all elements that match:
js// Find all elements with a data-columns attribute
const articles = document.querySelectorAll("[data-columns]");

// Find all elements with data-columns="3"
const threeColumnArticles = document.querySelectorAll('[data-columns="3"]');
// You can then iterate over the results
threeColumnArticles.forEach((article) => {
  console.log(article.dataset.indexNumber);
});
CSS accessNote that, as data attributes are plain HTML attributes, you can even access them from CSS. For example to show the parent data on the article you can use generated content in CSS with the attr() function:
cssarticle::before {
  content: attr(data-parent);
}

You can also use the attribute selectors in CSS to change styles according to the data:
cssarticle[data-columns="3"] {
  width: 400px;
}
article[data-columns="4"] {
  width: 600px;
}

You can see all this working together in this JS Bin example.
Data attributes can also be stored to contain information that is constantly changing, like scores in a game. Using the CSS selectors and JavaScript access here this allows you to build some nifty effects without having to write your own display routines. See this screencast for an example using generated content and CSS transitions (JS Bin example).
Data values are strings. Number values must be quoted in the selector for the styling to take effect.IssuesDo not store content that should be visible and accessible in data attributes, because assistive technology may not access them. In addition, search crawlers may not index data attributes' values.See also

See CORS settings attributes for details on how the crossorigin attribute is used.Security and tainted canvasesBecause the pixels in a canvas's bitmap can come from a variety of sources, including images or videos retrieved from other hosts, it's inevitable that security problems may arise.
As soon as you draw into a canvas any data that was loaded from another origin without CORS approval, the canvas becomes tainted. A tainted canvas is one which is no longer considered secure, and any attempts to retrieve image data back from the canvas will cause an exception to be thrown.
If the source of the foreign content is an HTML <img> or SVG <svg> element, attempting to retrieve the contents of the canvas isn't allowed.
If the foreign content comes from an image obtained from either as HTMLCanvasElement or ImageBitMap, and the image source doesn't meet the same origin rules, attempts to read the canvas's contents are blocked.
Calling any of the following on a tainted canvas will result in an error:

Calling getImageData() on the canvas's context
Calling toBlob(), toDataURL() or captureStream() on the <canvas> element itself

Attempting any of these when the canvas is tainted will cause a SecurityError to be thrown. This protects users from having private data exposed by using images to pull information from remote websites without permission.Storing an image from a foreign originIn this example, we wish to permit images from a foreign origin to be retrieved and saved to local storage. Implementing this requires configuring the server as well as writing code for the website itself.Web server configurationThe first thing we need is a server that's configured to host images with the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header configured to permit cross-origin access to image files.
Let's assume we're serving our site using Apache. Consider the HTML5 Boilerplate Apache server configuration file for CORS images, shown below:
xml<IfModule mod_setenvif.c>
  <IfModule mod_headers.c>
    <FilesMatch "\.(avifs?|bmp|cur|gif|ico|jpe?g|jxl|a?png|svgz?|webp)$">
      SetEnvIf Origin ":" IS_CORS
      Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*" env=IS_CORS
    </FilesMatch>
  </IfModule>
</IfModule>

In short, this configures the server to allow graphic files (those with the extensions ".bmp", ".cur", ".gif", ".ico", ".jpg", ".jpeg", ".png", ".svg", ".svgz", and ".webp") to be accessed cross-origin from anywhere on the internet.Implementing the save featureNow that the server has been configured to allow retrieval of the images cross-origin, we can write the code that allows the user to save them to local storage, just as if they were being served from the same domain the code is running on.
The key is to use the crossorigin attribute by setting crossOrigin on the HTMLImageElement into which the image will be loaded. This tells the browser to request cross-origin access when downloading the image data.
Starting the download
The code that starts the download (say, when the user clicks a "Download" button), looks like this:
jsfunction startDownload() {
  let imageURL =
    "https://cdn.glitch.com/4c9ebeb9-8b9a-4adc-ad0a-238d9ae00bb5%2Fmdn_logo-only_color.svg?1535749917189";
  let imageDescription = "The Mozilla logo";

  downloadedImg = new Image();
  downloadedImg.crossOrigin = "anonymous";
  downloadedImg.addEventListener("load", imageReceived, false);
  downloadedImg.alt = imageDescription;
  downloadedImg.src = imageURL;
}

We're using a hard-coded URL (imageURL) and associated descriptive text (imageDescription) here, but that could easily come from anywhere. To begin downloading the image, we create a new HTMLImageElement object by using the Image() constructor. The image is then configured to allow cross-origin downloading by setting its crossOrigin attribute to "anonymous" (that is, allow non-authenticated downloading of the image cross-origin). An event listener is added for the load event being fired on the image element, which means the image data has been received. Alternative text is added to the image; while <canvas> does not support the alt attribute, the value can be used to set an aria-label or the canvas's inner content.
Finally, the image's src attribute is set to the URL of the image to download; this triggers the download to begin.
Receiving and saving the image
The code that handles the newly-downloaded image is found in the imageReceived() method:
jsfunction imageReceived() {
  const canvas = document.createElement("canvas");
  const context = canvas.getContext("2d");

  canvas.width = downloadedImg.width;
  canvas.height = downloadedImg.height;
  canvas.innerText = downloadedImg.alt;

  context.drawImage(downloadedImg, 0, 0);
  imageBox.appendChild(canvas);

  try {
    localStorage.setItem("saved-image-example", canvas.toDataURL("image/png"));
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(`Error: ${err}`);
  }
}

imageReceived() is called to handle the "load" event on the HTMLImageElement that receives the downloaded image. This event is triggered once the downloaded data is all available. It begins by creating a new <canvas> element that we'll use to convert the image into a data URL, and by getting access to the canvas's 2D drawing context (CanvasRenderingContext2D) in the variable context.
The canvas's size is adjusted to match the received image, the inner text is set to the image description, then the image is drawn into the canvas using drawImage(). The canvas is then inserted into the document so the image is visible.
Now it's time to actually save the image locally. To do this, we use the Web Storage API's local storage mechanism, which is accessed through the localStorage global. The canvas method toDataURL() is used to convert the image into a data:// URL representing a PNG image, which is then saved into local storage using setItem().See also

HTML Specification - the crossorigin attribute
Web Storage API\n\nUse <img> with cross-origin images and <canvas>HTML provides a crossorigin attribute for images that, in combination with an appropriate CORS header, allows images defined by the <img> element that are loaded from foreign origins to be used in a <canvas> as if they had been loaded from the current origin.
See CORS settings attributes for details on how the crossorigin attribute is used.Security and tainted canvasesBecause the pixels in a canvas's bitmap can come from a variety of sources, including images or videos retrieved from other hosts, it's inevitable that security problems may arise.
As soon as you draw into a canvas any data that was loaded from another origin without CORS approval, the canvas becomes tainted. A tainted canvas is one which is no longer considered secure, and any attempts to retrieve image data back from the canvas will cause an exception to be thrown.
If the source of the foreign content is an HTML <img> or SVG <svg> element, attempting to retrieve the contents of the canvas isn't allowed.
If the foreign content comes from an image obtained from either as HTMLCanvasElement or ImageBitMap, and the image source doesn't meet the same origin rules, attempts to read the canvas's contents are blocked.
Calling any of the following on a tainted canvas will result in an error:

Calling getImageData() on the canvas's context
Calling toBlob(), toDataURL() or captureStream() on the <canvas> element itself

Attempting any of these when the canvas is tainted will cause a SecurityError to be thrown. This protects users from having private data exposed by using images to pull information from remote websites without permission.Storing an image from a foreign originIn this example, we wish to permit images from a foreign origin to be retrieved and saved to local storage.

Here are some things you need to know
  
    
      Prerequisites:
      
        You should already know how to create a basic HTML document and how to add accessible images to a webpage.
      
    
    
      Objective:
      
        Learn how to make different regions of one image link to different pages.
      
    
  


Warning:
This article discusses client-side image maps only. Do not use server-side image maps, which require the user to have a mouse.
Image maps, and their drawbacksWhen you nest an image inside <a>, the entire image links to one webpage. An image map, on the other hand, contains several active regions (called "hotspots") that each link to a different resource.
Formerly, image maps were a popular navigation device, but it's important to thoroughly consider their performance and accessibility ramifications.

Warning:
Multiple images referencing the same image map may lead to unexpected browser behavior, severely degrading usability and accessibility. For example, when a user keyboard navigates an image with a re-used image map in Safari and Chromium-based browsers, latter image instances using that same image map are skipped entirely. In Firefox, all image maps get keyboard focus simultaneously and when the user keyboard navigates past the image, the next focused element is the one after the last image instance, effectively skipping everything between the two images.

Text links (perhaps styled with CSS) are preferable to image maps for several reasons: text links are lightweight, maintainable, often more SEO-friendly, and support accessibility needs (e.g., screen readers, text-only browsers, translation services).How to insert an image map, properlyStep 1: The imageNot just any image is acceptable.

The image must make it clear what happens when people follow image links. alt text is mandatory, of course, but many people never see it.
The image must clearly indicate where hotspots begin and end.
Hotspots must be large enough to tap comfortably, at any viewport size. How large is large enough? 72 × 72 CSS pixels is a good minimum, with additional generous gaps between touch targets. The map of the world at 50languages.com (as of time of writing) illustrates the problem perfectly. It's much easier to tap Russia or North America than Albania or Estonia.

You insert your image much the same way as always (with an <img> element and alt text). If the image is only present as a navigation device, you may write alt="", provided you furnish appropriate alt text in the <area> elements later on.
You will need a special usemap attribute. Come up with a unique name, containing no spaces, for your image map. Then assign that name (preceded by a hash) as the value for the usemap attribute:
html<img src="image-map.png" alt="" usemap="#example-map-1" />
Step 2: Activate your hotspotsIn this step, put all your code inside a <map> element. <map> only needs one attribute, the same map name as you used in your usemap attribute above:
html<map name="example-map-1"> </map>

Inside the <map> element, we need <area> elements. An <area> element corresponds to a single hotspot. To keep keyboard navigation intuitive, make sure the source order of <area> elements corresponds to the visual order of hotspots.
<area> elements are void elements, but do require four attributes:

shape

The shape attribute takes one of four values: circle, rect, poly, and default. An <area> whose shape is default occupies the entire image, minus any other hotspots you've defined.
If there is any overlap between the defined areas, the source order determines which area takes preference.
The shape you choose determines the coordinate information you'll need to provide in coords.

coords

Coordinates are given in CSS pixels, and its value is dependent on the shape selected.

For a circle, provide the center's x and y coordinates, followed by the length of the radius.
For a rectangle, provide the x and y coordinates of the upper-left and bottom-right corners.
For a polygon, to provide the x and y coordinates of each corner (so, at least six values).


href

The URL of the resource you're linking to. You may leave this attribute blank if you don't want the current area to link anywhere (say, if you're making a hollow circle.)

alt

A mandatory attribute, telling people where the link goes or what it does. alt text only displays when the image is unavailable. Please refer to our guidelines for writing accessible link text.
You may write alt="" if the href attribute is blank and the entire image already has an alt attribute.


html<map name="example-map-1">
  <area
    shape="circle"
    coords="200,250,25"
    href="page-2.html"
    alt="circle example" />

  <area
    shape="rect"
    coords="10, 5, 20, 15"
    href="page-3.html"
    alt="rectangle example" />
</map>
Step 3: Make sure it works for everybodyYou aren't done until you test image maps rigorously on many browsers and devices. Try following links with your keyboard alone. Try turning images off.
If your image map is wider than about 240px, you'll need to make further adjustments to make your website responsive. It's not enough to resize the image for small screens, because the coordinates stay the same and no longer match the image.Learn more

The shape attribute takes one of four values: circle, rect, poly, and default. An <area> whose shape is default occupies the entire image, minus any other hotspots you've defined.
If there is any overlap between the defined areas, the source order determines which area takes preference.
The shape you choose determines the coordinate information you'll need to provide in coords.

coords

Coordinates are given in CSS pixels, and its value is dependent on the shape selected.

For a circle, provide the center's x and y coordinates, followed by the length of the radius.
For a rectangle, provide the x and y coordinates of the upper-left and bottom-right corners.
For a polygon, to provide the x and y coordinates of each corner (so, at least six values).


href

The URL of the resource you're linking to. You may leave this attribute blank if you don't want the current area to link anywhere (say, if you're making a hollow circle.)

alt

A mandatory attribute, telling people where the link goes or what it does. alt text only displays when the image is unavailable. Please refer to our guidelines for writing accessible link text.
You may write alt="" if the href attribute is blank and the entire image already has an alt attribute.


html<map name="example-map-1">
  <area
    shape="circle"
    coords="200,250,25"
    href="page-2.html"
    alt="circle example" />

  <area
    shape="rect"
    coords="10, 5, 20, 15"
    href="page-3.html"
    alt="rectangle example" />
</map>
Step 3: Make sure it works for everybodyYou aren't done until you test image maps rigorously on many browsers and devices. Try following links with your keyboard alone. Try turning images off.
If your image map is wider than about 240px, you'll need to make further adjustments to make your website responsive. It's not enough to resize the image for small screens, because the coordinates stay the same and no longer match the image.Learn more

An optimized web page not only provides for a more responsive site for your visitors but also reduces the load on your web servers and internet connection. This can be crucial for high volume sites or sites which have a spike in traffic due to unusual circumstances such as breaking news stories.
Optimizing page load performance is not just for content which will be viewed by narrowband dial-up or mobile device visitors. It is just as important for broadband content and can lead to dramatic improvements even for your visitors with the fastest connections.TipsReduce page weightPage weight is by far the most important factor in page-load performance.
Reducing page weight through the elimination of unnecessary whitespace and comments, commonly known as minimization, and by moving inline script and CSS into external files, can improve download performance with minimal need for other changes in the page structure.
Tools such as HTML Tidy can automatically strip leading whitespace and extra blank lines from valid HTML source. Other tools can "compress" JavaScript by reformatting the source or by obfuscating the source and replacing long identifiers with shorter versions.Minimize the number of filesReducing the number of files referenced in a web page lowers the number of HTTP connections required to download a page, thereby reducing the time for these requests to be sent, and for their responses to be received.
Depending on a browser's cache settings, it may send a request with the If-Modified-Since header for each referenced file, asking whether the file has been modified since the last time it was downloaded. Too much time spent querying the last modified time of the referenced files can delay the initial display of the web page, since the browser must check the modification time for each of these files, before rendering the page.
If you use background images a lot in your CSS, you can reduce the number of HTTP lookups needed by combining the images into one, known as an image sprite. Then you just apply the same image each time you need it for a background and adjust the x/y coordinates appropriately. This technique works best with elements that will have limited dimensions, and will not work for every use of a background image. However, the fewer HTTP requests and single image caching can help reduce page-load time.Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN)For the purposes of this article, a CDN is a means to reduce the physical distance between your server and your visitor. As the distance between your server origin and visitor increases, the load times will increase. Suppose your website server is located in the United States and it has a visitor from India; the page load time will be much higher for the Indian visitor compared to a visitor from the US.
A CDN is a geographically distributed network of servers that work together to shorten the distance between the user and your website. CDNs store cached versions of your website and serve them to visitors via the network node closest to the user, thereby reducing latency.

Understanding CDNs
Reduce domain lookupsSince each separate domain costs time in a DNS lookup, the page load time will grow along with the number of separate domains appearing in CSS link(s) and JavaScript and image src(es).
This may not always be practical; however, you should always take care to use only the minimum necessary number of different domains in your pages.Cache reused contentMake sure that any content that can be cached, is cached, and with appropriate expiration times.
In particular, pay attention to the Last-Modified header. It allows for efficient page caching; by means of this header, information is conveyed to the user agent about the file it wants to load, such as when it was last modified. Most web servers automatically append the Last-Modified header to static pages (e.g., .html, .css), based on the last-modified date stored in the file system. With dynamic pages (e.g., .php, .aspx), this, of course, can't be done, and the header is not sent.
So, in particular, for pages which are generated dynamically, a little research on this subject is beneficial. It can be somewhat involved, but it will save a lot in page requests on pages which would normally not be cacheable.

Optimally order the components of the pageDownload page content first, along with any CSS or JavaScript that may be required for its initial display, so that the user gets the quickest apparent response during the page loading. This content is typically text, and can, therefore, benefit from text compression in transit, thus providing an even quicker response to the user.
Any dynamic features that require the page to complete loading before being used, should be initially disabled, and then only enabled after the page has loaded. This will cause the JavaScript to be loaded after the page contents, which will improve the overall appearance of the page load.Reduce the number of inline scriptsInline scripts can be expensive for page loading since the parser must assume that an inline script could modify the page structure while parsing is in progress. Reducing the use of inline scripts in general, and reducing the use of document.write() to output content in particular, can improve overall page loading. Use DOM APIs to manipulate page content, rather than document.write().Use modern CSS and valid markupUse of modern CSS reduces the amount of markup, can reduce the need for (spacer) images, in terms of layout, and can very often replace images of stylized text — that "cost" much more than the equivalent text-and-CSS.
Using valid markup has other advantages. First, browsers will have no need to perform error-correction when parsing the HTML (this is aside from the philosophical issue of whether to allow format variation in user input and then programmatically "correct" or normalize it; or whether, instead, to enforce a strict, no-tolerance input format).
Moreover, valid markup allows for the free use of other tools that can pre-process your web pages. For example, HTML Tidy can remove whitespace and optional ending tags; however, it will refuse to run on a page with serious markup errors.Chunk your contentTables for layouts are a legacy method that should not be used anymore. Layouts utilizing floats, positioning, flexbox, or grids should be used instead.
Tables are still considered valid markup but should be used for displaying tabular data. To help the browser render your page quicker, you should avoid nesting your tables.
Rather than deeply nesting tables as in:
html<table>
  <table>
    <table>
      …
    </table>
  </table>
</table>

use non-nested tables or divs as in
html<table>
  …
</table>
<table>
  …
</table>
<table>
  …
</table>

Configure your servers, apply gzip compression for SVG assets.Minify and compress your imagesLarge images cause your page to take more time to load. Consider compressing your images before adding them to your page, using compression features built into image-manipulation tools such as Photoshop, or using a specialized tool such as Compress JPEG or Tiny PNG.Specify sizes for images and tablesIf the browser can immediately determine the height and/or width of your images and tables, it will be able to display a web page without having to reflow the content. This not only speeds the display of the page but prevents annoying changes in a page's layout when the page completes loading. For this reason, height and width should be specified for images, whenever possible.
Tables should use the CSS selector: property combination:
csstable-layout: fixed;

and should specify widths of columns using the <col> and the <colgroup> elements.Use lazy loading for imagesBy default, images are loaded eagerly; that is, the image is fetched and rendered as soon as it's processed in the HTML. All eagerly loaded images are rendered before the window's load event is sent. Switching to lazy loading of images tells the browser to hold off on loading images until they're about to be needed to draw the visual viewport.
To mark an image for lazy loading, specify its loading attribute with a value of lazy. With this set, the image will only be loaded when it's needed.
html<img src="./images/footerlogo.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="MDN logo" />

Note that lazily-loaded images may not be available when the load event is fired. You can determine if a given image is loaded by checking to see if the value of its Boolean complete property is true.Choose your user-agent requirements wiselyTo achieve the greatest improvements in page design, make sure that reasonable user-agent requirements are specified for projects. Do not require your content to appear pixel-perfect in all browsers, especially not in down-version browsers.
Ideally, your basic minimum requirements should be based on the consideration of modern browsers that support the relevant standards. This can include recent versions of Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera, and Safari.
Note, however, that many of the tips listed in this article are common-sense techniques which apply to any user agent, and can be applied to any web page, regardless of browser-support requirements.Use async and defer, if possibleMake the JavaScript scripts such that they are compatible with both the async and the defer attributes, and use async whenever possible, especially if you have multiple script elements.
With that, the page can stop rendering while JavaScript is still loading. Otherwise, the browser will not render anything that is after the script elements that do not have these attributes.
Note: Even though these attributes do help a lot the first time a page is loaded, you should use them but not assume they will work in all browsers. If you already follow all JavaScript best practices, there is no need to change your code.Example page structure

<html>


<head>


<link>
CSS files required for page appearance. Minimize the number of files for performance while keeping unrelated CSS in separate files for maintenance.


<script>

<body>

<script>

There is no need to load these scripts before the page content. That only slows down the initial appearance of the page load.

About JavaScriptJavaScript is a programming language mostly used client-side to make webpages interactive. You can create amazing webpages without JavaScript, but JavaScript opens up a whole new level of possibilities.

If you already know something about JavaScript or if you have a background with other programming languages, we suggest you jump directly into our JavaScript Guide.
How to trigger JavaScript from HTMLWithin a browser, JavaScript doesn't do anything by itself. You run JavaScript from inside your HTML webpages. To call JavaScript code from within HTML, you need the <script> element. There are two ways to use script, depending on whether you're linking to an external script or embedding a script right in your webpage.Linking an external scriptUsually, you'll be writing scripts in their own .js files. If you want to execute a .js script from your webpage, just use <script> with an src attribute pointing to the script file, using its URL:
html<script src="path/to/my/script.js"></script>
Writing JavaScript within HTMLYou may also add JavaScript code between <script> tags rather than providing an src attribute.
html<script>
  window.addEventListener("load", () => {
    console.log("This function is executed once the page is fully loaded");
  });
</script>

That's convenient when you just need a small bit of JavaScript, but if you keep JavaScript in separate files you'll find it easier to

focus on your work
write self-sufficient HTML
write structured JavaScript applications
Use scripting accessiblyAccessibility is a major issue in any software development. JavaScript can make your website more accessible if you use it wisely, or it can become a disaster if you use scripting without care. To make JavaScript work in your favor, it's worth knowing about certain best practices for adding JavaScript:


Make all content available as (structured) text. Rely on HTML for your content as much as possible. For example, if you've implemented a nice JavaScript progress bar, make sure to supplement it with matching text percentages inside the HTML. Likewise, your drop-down menus should be structured as unordered lists of links.


Make all functionality accessible from the keyboard.

Let users Tab through all controls (e.g., links and form input) in a logical order.
If you use pointer events (like mouse events or touch events), duplicate the functionality with keyboard events.
Test your site using a keyboard only.



Don't set nor even guess time limits. It takes extra time to navigate with the keyboard or hear content read out. You can hardly ever predict just how long it will take for users or browsers to complete a process (especially asynchronous actions such as loading resources).


Keep animations subtle and brief with no flashing. Flashing is annoying and can cause seizures. Additionally, if an animation lasts more than a couple seconds, give the user a way to cancel it.


Let users initiate interactions. That means, don't update content, redirect, or refresh automatically. Don't use carousels or display popups without warning.


Have a plan B for users without JavaScript. People may have JavaScript turned off to improve speed and security, and users often face network issues that prevent loading scripts. Moreover, third-party scripts (ads, tracking scripts, browser extensions) might break your scripts.

At a minimum, leave a short message with <noscript> like this: <noscript>To use this site, please enable JavaScript.</noscript>
Ideally, replicate the JavaScript functionality with HTML and server-side scripting when possible.
If you're only looking for simple visual effects, CSS can often get the job done even more intuitively.
Since almost everybody does have JavaScript enabled, <noscript> is no excuse for writing inaccessible scripts.

Main root


Element
Description




<html>
Represents the root (top-level element) of an HTML document, so it is also referred to as the root element. All other elements must be descendants of this element.


Document metadataMetadata contains information about the page. This includes information about styles, scripts and data to help software (search engines, browsers, etc.) use and render the page. Metadata for styles and scripts may be defined in the page or linked to another file that has the information.



Element
Description




<base>
Specifies the base URL to use for all relative URLs in a document. There can be only one such element in a document.


<head>
Contains machine-readable information (metadata) about the document, like its title, scripts, and style sheets.


<link>
Specifies relationships between the current document and an external resource. This element is most commonly used to link to CSS but is also used to establish site icons (both "favicon" style icons and icons for the home screen and apps on mobile devices) among other things.


<meta>
Represents metadata that cannot be represented by other HTML meta-related elements, like <base>, <link>, <script>, <style> and <title>.


<style>
Contains style information for a document or part of a document. It contains CSS, which is applied to the contents of the document containing this element.


<title>
Defines the document's title that is shown in a browser's title bar or a page's tab. It only contains text; HTML tags within the element, if any, are also treated as plain text.


Sectioning root


Element
Description




<body>
Represents the content of an HTML document. There can be only one such element in a document.


Content sectioningContent sectioning elements allow you to organize the document content into logical pieces. Use the sectioning elements to create a broad outline for your page content, including header and footer navigation, and heading elements to identify sections of content.



Element
Description




<address>
Indicates that the enclosed HTML provides contact information for a person or people, or for an organization.


<article>
Represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication). Examples include a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, a blog entry, a product card, a user-submitted comment, an interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent item of content.


<aside>
Represents a portion of a document whose content is only indirectly related to the document's main content. Asides are frequently presented as sidebars or call-out boxes.


<footer>
Represents a footer for its nearest ancestor sectioning content or sectioning root element. A <footer> typically contains information about the author of the section, copyright data, or links to related documents.


<header>
Represents introductory content, typically a group of introductory or navigational aids. It may contain some heading elements but also a logo, a search form, an author name, and other elements.


<h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>
Represent six levels of section headings. <h1> is the highest section level and <h6> is the lowest.


<hgroup>
Represents a heading grouped with any secondary content, such as subheadings, an alternative title, or a tagline.


<main>
Represents the dominant content of the body of a document. The main content area consists of content that is directly related to or expands upon the central topic of a document, or the central functionality of an application.


<nav>
Represents a section of a page whose purpose is to provide navigation links, either within the current document or to other documents. Common examples of navigation sections are menus, tables of contents, and indexes.


<section>
Represents a generic standalone section of a document, which doesn't have a more specific semantic element to represent it. Sections should always have a heading, with very few exceptions.


<search>
Represents a part that contains a set of form controls or other content related to performing a search or filtering operation.


Text contentUse HTML text content elements to organize blocks or sections of content placed between the opening <body> and closing </body> tags. Important for accessibility and SEO, these elements identify the purpose or structure of that content.



Element
Description




<blockquote>
Indicates that the enclosed text is an extended quotation. Usually, this is rendered visually by indentation. A URL for the source of the quotation may be given using the cite attribute, while a text representation of the source can be given using the <cite> element.


<dd>
Provides the description, definition, or value for the preceding term (<dt>) in a description list (<dl>).


<div>
The generic container for flow content. It has no effect on the content or layout until styled in some way using CSS (e.g., styling is directly applied to it, or some kind of layout model like flexbox is applied to its parent element).


<dl>
Represents a description list. The element encloses a list of groups of terms (specified using the <dt> element) and descriptions (provided by <dd> elements). Common uses for this element are to implement a glossary or to display metadata (a list of key-value pairs).


<dt>
Specifies a term in a description or definition list, and as such must be used inside a <dl> element. It is usually followed by a <dd> element; however, multiple <dt> elements in a row indicate several terms that are all defined by the immediate next <dd> element.


<figcaption>
Represents a caption or legend describing the rest of the contents of its parent <figure> element.


<figure>
Represents self-contained content, potentially with an optional caption, which is specified using the <figcaption> element. The figure, its caption, and its contents are referenced as a single unit.


<hr>
Represents a thematic break between paragraph-level elements: for example, a change of scene in a story, or a shift of topic within a section.


<li>
Represents an item in a list. It must be contained in a parent element: an ordered list (<ol>), an unordered list (<ul>), or a menu (<menu>). In menus and unordered lists, list items are usually displayed using bullet points. In ordered lists, they are usually displayed with an ascending counter on the left, such as a number or letter.


<menu>
A semantic alternative to <ul>, but treated by browsers (and exposed through the accessibility tree) as no different than <ul>. It represents an unordered list of items (which are represented by <li> elements).


<ol>
Represents an ordered list of items — typically rendered as a numbered list.


<p>
Represents a paragraph. Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields.


<pre>
Represents preformatted text which is to be presented exactly as written in the HTML file. The text is typically rendered using a non-proportional, or monospaced, font. Whitespace inside this element is displayed as written.


<ul>
Represents an unordered list of items, typically rendered as a bulleted list.


Inline text semanticsUse the HTML inline text semantic to define the meaning, structure, or style of a word, line, or any arbitrary piece of text.



Element
Description




<a>
Together with its href attribute, creates a hyperlink to web pages, files, email addresses, locations within the current page, or anything else a URL can address.


<abbr>
Represents an abbreviation or acronym.


<b>
Used to draw the reader's attention to the element's contents, which are not otherwise granted special importance. This was formerly known as the Boldface element, and most browsers still draw the text in boldface. However, you should not use <b> for styling text or granting importance. If you wish to create boldface text, you should use the CSS font-weight property. If you wish to indicate an element is of special importance, you should use the <strong> element.


<bdi>
Tells the browser's bidirectional algorithm to treat the text it contains in isolation from its surrounding text. It's particularly useful when a website dynamically inserts some text and doesn't know the directionality of the text being inserted.


<bdo>
Overrides the current directionality of text, so that the text within is rendered in a different direction.


<br>
Produces a line break in text (carriage-return). It is useful for writing a poem or an address, where the division of lines is significant.


<cite>
Used to mark up the title of a creative work. The reference may be in an abbreviated form according to context-appropriate conventions related to citation metadata.


<code>
Displays its contents styled in a fashion intended to indicate that the text is a short fragment of computer code. By default, the content text is displayed using the user agent's default monospace font.


<data>
Links a given piece of content with a machine-readable translation. If the content is time- or date-related, the <time> element must be used.


<dfn>
Used to indicate the term being defined within the context of a definition phrase or sentence. The ancestor <p> element, the <dt>/<dd> pairing, or the nearest section ancestor of the <dfn> element, is considered to be the definition of the term.


<em>
Marks text that has stress emphasis. The <em> element can be nested, with each nesting level indicating a greater degree of emphasis.


<i>
Represents a range of text that is set off from the normal text for some reason, such as idiomatic text, technical terms, and taxonomical designations, among others. Historically, these have been presented using italicized type, which is the original source of the <i> naming of this element.


<kbd>
Represents a span of inline text denoting textual user input from a keyboard, voice input, or any other text entry device. By convention, the user agent defaults to rendering the contents of a <kbd> element using its default monospace font, although this is not mandated by the HTML standard.


<mark>
Represents text which is marked or highlighted for reference or notation purposes due to the marked passage's relevance in the enclosing context.


<q>
Indicates that the enclosed text is a short inline quotation. Most modern browsers implement this by surrounding the text in quotation marks. This element is intended for short quotations that don't require paragraph breaks; for long quotations use the <blockquote> element.


<rp>
Used to provide fall-back parentheses for browsers that do not support the display of ruby annotations using the <ruby> element. One <rp> element should enclose each of the opening and closing parentheses that wrap the <rt> element that contains the annotation's text.


<rt>
Specifies the ruby text component of a ruby annotation, which is used to provide pronunciation, translation, or transliteration information for East Asian typography. The <rt> element must always be contained within a <ruby> element.


<ruby>
Represents small annotations that are rendered above, below, or next to base text, usually used for showing the pronunciation of East Asian characters. It can also be used for annotating other kinds of text, but this usage is less common.


<s>
Renders text with a strikethrough, or a line through it. Use the <s> element to represent things that are no longer relevant or no longer accurate. However, <s> is not appropriate when indicating document edits; for that, use the <del> and <ins> elements, as appropriate.


<samp>
Used to enclose inline text which represents sample (or quoted) output from a computer program. Its contents are typically rendered using the browser's default monospaced font (such as Courier or Lucida Console).


<small>
Represents side-comments and small print, like copyright and legal text, independent of its styled presentation. By default, it renders text within it one font size smaller, such as from small to x-small.


<span>
A generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the class or id attributes), or because they share attribute values, such as lang. It should be used only when no other semantic element is appropriate. <span> is very much like a div element, but div is a block-level element whereas a <span> is an inline-level element.


<strong>
Indicates that its contents have strong importance, seriousness, or urgency. Browsers typically render the contents in bold type.


<sub>
Specifies inline text which should be displayed as subscript for solely typographical reasons. Subscripts are typically rendered with a lowered baseline using smaller text.


<sup>
Specifies inline text which is to be displayed as superscript for solely typographical reasons. Superscripts are usually rendered with a raised baseline using smaller text.


<time>
Represents a specific period in time. It may include the datetime attribute to translate dates into machine-readable format, allowing for better search engine results or custom features such as reminders.


<u>
Represents a span of inline text which should be rendered in a way that indicates that it has a non-textual annotation. This is rendered by default as a single solid underline but may be altered using CSS.


<var>
Represents the name of a variable in a mathematical expression or a programming context. It's typically presented using an italicized version of the current typeface, although that behavior is browser-dependent.


<wbr>
Represents a word break opportunity—a position within text where the browser may optionally break a line, though its line-breaking rules would not otherwise create a break at that location.


Image and multimediaHTML supports various multimedia resources such as images, audio, and video.



Element
Description




<area>
Defines an area inside an image map that has predefined clickable areas. An image map allows geometric areas on an image to be associated with hyperlink.


<audio>
Used to embed sound content in documents. It may contain one or more audio sources, represented using the src attribute or the source element: the browser will choose the most suitable one. It can also be the destination for streamed media, using a MediaStream.


<img>
Embeds an image into the document.


<map>
Used with <area> elements to define an image map (a clickable link area).


<track>
Used as a child of the media elements, audio and video. It lets you specify timed text tracks (or time-based data), for example to automatically handle subtitles. The tracks are formatted in WebVTT format (.vtt files)—Web Video Text Tracks.


<video>
Embeds a media player which supports video playback into the document. You can also use <video> for audio content, but the audio element may provide a more appropriate user experience.


Embedded contentIn addition to regular multimedia content, HTML can include a variety of other content, even if it's not always easy to interact with.



Element
Description




<embed>
Embeds external content at the specified point in the document. This content is provided by an external application or other source of interactive content such as a browser plug-in.


<fencedframe>
Represents a nested browsing context, like <iframe> but with more native privacy features built in.


<iframe>
Represents a nested browsing context, embedding another HTML page into the current one.


<object>
Represents an external resource, which can be treated as an image, a nested browsing context, or a resource to be handled by a plugin.


<picture>
Contains zero or more <source> elements and one <img> element to offer alternative versions of an image for different display/device scenarios.


<source>
Specifies multiple media resources for the picture, the audio element, or the video element. It is a void element, meaning that it has no content and does not have a closing tag. It is commonly used to offer the same media content in multiple file formats in order to provide compatibility with a broad range of browsers given their differing support for image file formats and media file formats.


SVG and MathMLYou can embed SVG and MathML content directly into HTML documents, using the <svg> and <math> elements.



Element
Description




<svg>
Container defining a new coordinate system and viewport. It is used as the outermost element of SVG documents, but it can also be used to embed an SVG fragment inside an SVG or HTML document.


<math>
The top-level element in MathML. Every valid MathML instance must be wrapped in it. In addition, you must not nest a second <math> element in another, but you can have an arbitrary number of other child elements in it.


ScriptingTo create dynamic content and Web applications, HTML supports the use of scripting languages, most prominently JavaScript. Certain elements support this capability.



Element
Description




<canvas>
Container element to use with either the canvas scripting API or the WebGL API to draw graphics and animations.


<noscript>
Defines a section of HTML to be inserted if a script type on the page is unsupported or if scripting is currently turned off in the browser.


<script>
Used to embed executable code or data; this is typically used to embed or refer to JavaScript code. The <script> element can also be used with other languages, such as WebGL's GLSL shader programming language and JSON.


Demarcating editsThese elements let you provide indications that specific parts of the text have been altered.



Element
Description




<del>
Represents a range of text that has been deleted from a document. This can be used when rendering "track changes" or source code diff information, for example. The <ins> element can be used for the opposite purpose: to indicate text that has been added to the document.


<ins>
Represents a range of text that has been added to a document. You can use the <del> element to similarly represent a range of text that has been deleted from the document.


Table contentThe elements here are used to create and handle tabular data.



Element
Description




<caption>
Specifies the caption (or title) of a table.


<col>
Defines one or more columns in a column group represented by its implicit or explicit parent <colgroup> element. The <col> element is only valid as a child of a <colgroup> element that has no span attribute defined.


<colgroup>
Defines a group of columns within a table.


<table>
Represents tabular data—that is, information presented in a two-dimensional table comprised of rows and columns of cells containing data.


<tbody>
Encapsulates a set of table rows (<tr> elements), indicating that they comprise the body of a table's (main) data.


<td>
A child of the <tr> element, it defines a cell of a table that contains data.


<tfoot>
Encapsulates a set of table rows (<tr> elements), indicating that they comprise the foot of a table with information about the table's columns. This is usually a summary of the columns, e.g., a sum of the given numbers in a column.


<th>
A child of the <tr> element, it defines a cell as the header of a group of table cells. The nature of this group can be explicitly defined by the scope and headers attributes.


<thead>
Encapsulates a set of table rows (<tr> elements), indicating that they comprise the head of a table with information about the table's columns. This is usually in the form of column headers (<th> elements).


<tr>
Defines a row of cells in a table. The row's cells can then be established using a mix of <td> (data cell) and <th> (header cell) elements.


FormsHTML provides several elements that can be used together to create forms that the user can fill out and submit to the website or application. Further information about this available in the HTML forms guide.



Element
Description




<button>
An interactive element activated by a user with a mouse, keyboard, finger, voice command, or other assistive technology. Once activated, it performs an action, such as submitting a form or opening a dialog.


<datalist>
Contains a set of <option> elements that represent the permissible or recommended options available to choose from within other controls.


<fieldset>
Used to group several controls as well as labels (<label>) within a web form.


<form>
Represents a document section containing interactive controls for submitting information.


<input>
Used to create interactive controls for web-based forms to accept data from the user; a wide variety of types of input data and control widgets are available, depending on the device and user agent. The <input> element is one of the most powerful and complex in all of HTML due to the sheer number of combinations of input types and attributes.


<label>
Represents a caption for an item in a user interface.


<legend>
Represents a caption for the content of its parent <fieldset>.


<meter>
Represents either a scalar value within a known range or a fractional value.


<optgroup>
Creates a grouping of options within a <select> element.


<option>
Used to define an item contained in a select, an <optgroup>, or a <datalist> element. As such, <option> can represent menu items in popups and other lists of items in an HTML document.


<output>
Container element into which a site or app can inject the results of a calculation or the outcome of a user action.


<progress>
Displays an indicator showing the completion progress of a task, typically displayed as a progress bar.


<select>
Represents a control that provides a menu of options.


<selectedcontent>
Displays the content of the currently selected <option> inside a closed <select> element.


<textarea>
Represents a multi-line plain-text editing control, useful when you want to allow users to enter a sizeable amount of free-form text, for example, a comment on a review or feedback form.


Interactive elementsHTML offers a selection of elements that help to create interactive user interface objects.



Element
Description




<details>
Creates a disclosure widget in which information is visible only when the widget is toggled into an "open" state. A summary or label must be provided using the <summary> element.


<dialog>
Represents a dialog box or other interactive component, such as a dismissible alert, inspector, or subwindow.


<summary>
Specifies a summary, caption, or legend for a details element's disclosure box. Clicking the <summary> element toggles the state of the parent <details> element open and closed.


Web ComponentsWeb Components is an HTML-related technology that makes it possible to, essentially, create and use custom elements as if it were regular HTML. In addition, you can create custom versions of standard HTML elements.



Element
Description




<slot>
Part of the Web Components technology suite, this element is a placeholder inside a web component that you can fill with your own markup, which lets you create separate DOM trees and present them together.


<template>
A mechanism for holding HTML that is not to be rendered immediately when a page is loaded but may be instantiated subsequently during runtime using JavaScript.


Obsolete and deprecated elements
Warning:
These are old HTML elements that are deprecated and should not be used. You should never use them in new projects, and you should replace them in old projects as soon as you can. They are listed here for completeness only.




Element
Description




<acronym>
Allows authors to clearly indicate a sequence of characters that compose an acronym or abbreviation for a word.


<big>
Renders the enclosed text at a font size one level larger than the surrounding text (medium becomes large, for example). The size is capped at the browser's maximum permitted font size.


<center>
Displays its block-level or inline contents centered horizontally within its containing element.


<content>
An obsolete part of the Web Components suite of technologies—was used inside of Shadow DOM as an insertion point, and wasn't meant to be used in ordinary HTML. It has now been replaced by the <slot> element, which creates a point in the DOM at which a shadow DOM can be inserted. Consider using <slot> instead.


<dir>
Container for a directory of files and/or folders, potentially with styles and icons applied by the user agent. Do not use this obsolete element; instead, you should use the <ul> element for lists, including lists of files.


<font>
Defines the font size, color and face for its content.


<frame>
Defines a particular area in which another HTML document can be displayed. A frame should be used within a <frameset>.


<frameset>
Used to contain <frame> elements.


<image>
An ancient and poorly supported precursor to the <img> element. It should not be used.


<marquee>
Used to insert a scrolling area of text. You can control what happens when the text reaches the edges of its content area using its attributes.


<menuitem>
Represents a command that a user is able to invoke through a popup menu. This includes context menus, as well as menus that might be attached to a menu button.


<nobr>
Prevents the text it contains from automatically wrapping across multiple lines, potentially resulting in the user having to scroll horizontally to see the entire width of the text.


<noembed>
An obsolete, non-standard way to provide alternative, or "fallback", content for browsers that do not support the embed element or do not support the type of embedded content an author wishes to use. This element was deprecated in HTML 4.01 and above in favor of placing fallback content between the opening and closing tags of an <object> element.


<noframes>
Provides content to be presented in browsers that don't support (or have disabled support for) the <frame> element. Although most commonly-used browsers support frames, there are exceptions, including certain special-use browsers including some mobile browsers, as well as text-mode browsers.


<param>
Defines parameters for an <object> element.


<plaintext>
Renders everything following the start tag as raw text, ignoring any following HTML. There is no closing tag, since everything after it is considered raw text.


<rb>
Used to delimit the base text component of a ruby annotation, i.e., the text that is being annotated. One <rb> element should wrap each separate atomic segment of the base text.


<rtc>
Embraces semantic annotations of characters presented in a ruby of <rb> elements used inside of <ruby> element. <rb> elements can have both pronunciation (<rt>) and semantic (<rtc>) annotations.


<shadow>
An obsolete part of the Web Components technology suite that was intended to be used as a shadow DOM insertion point. You might have used it if you have created multiple shadow roots under a shadow host. Consider using <slot> instead.


<strike>
Places a strikethrough (horizontal line) over text.


<tt>
Creates inline text which is presented using the user agent default monospace font face. This element was created for the purpose of rendering text as it would be displayed on a fixed-width display such as a teletype, text-only screen, or line printer.


<xmp>
Renders text between the start and end tags without interpreting the HTML in between and using a monospaced font. The HTML2 specification recommended that it should be rendered wide enough to allow 80 characters per line.

Main root


Element
Description




<html>
Represents the root (top-level element) of an HTML document, so it is also referred to as the root element. All other elements must be descendants of this element.


Document metadataMetadata contains information about the page. This includes information about styles, scripts and data to help software (search engines, browsers, etc.) use and render the page. Metadata for styles and scripts may be defined in the page or linked to another file that has the information.



Element
Description




<base>
Specifies the base URL to use for all relative URLs in a document. There can be only one such element in a document.


<head>
Contains machine-readable information (metadata) about the document, like its title, scripts, and style sheets.


<link>
Specifies relationships between the current document and an external resource. This element is most commonly used to link to CSS but is also used to establish site icons (both "favicon" style icons and icons for the home screen and apps on mobile devices) among other things.


<meta>
Represents metadata that cannot be represented by other HTML meta-related elements, like <base>, <link>, <script>, <style> and <title>.


<style>
Contains style information for a document or part of a document. It contains CSS, which is applied to the contents of the document containing this element.


<title>
Defines the document's title that is shown in a browser's title bar or a page's tab. It only contains text; HTML tags within the element, if any, are also treated as plain text.


Sectioning root


Element
Description




<body>
Represents the content of an HTML document. There can be only one such element in a document.


Content sectioningContent sectioning elements allow you to organize the document content into logical pieces. Use the sectioning elements to create a broad outline for your page content, including header and footer navigation, and heading elements to identify sections of content.



Element
Description




<address>
Indicates that the enclosed HTML provides contact information for a person or people, or for an organization.


<article>
Represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication). Examples include a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, a blog entry, a product card, a user-submitted comment, an interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent item of content.


<aside>
Represents a portion of a document whose content is only indirectly related to the document's main content. Asides are frequently presented as sidebars or call-out boxes.


<footer>
Represents a footer for its nearest ancestor sectioning content or sectioning root element. A <footer> typically contains information about the author of the section, copyright data, or links to related documents.


<header>
Represents introductory content, typically a group of introductory or navigational aids. It may contain some heading elements but also a logo, a search form, an author name, and other elements.


<h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>
Represent six levels of section headings. <h1> is the highest section level and <h6> is the lowest.


<hgroup>
Represents a heading grouped with any secondary content, such as subheadings, an alternative title, or a tagline.


<main>
Represents the dominant content of the body of a document. The main content area consists of content that is directly related to or expands upon the central topic of a document, or the central functionality of an application.


<nav>
Represents a section of a page whose purpose is to provide navigation links, either within the current document or to other documents. Common examples of navigation sections are menus, tables of contents, and indexes.


<section>
Represents a generic standalone section of a document, which doesn't have a more specific semantic element to represent it. Sections should always have a heading, with very few exceptions.


<search>
Represents a part that contains a set of form controls or other content related to performing a search or filtering operation.


Text contentUse HTML text content elements to organize blocks or sections of content placed between the opening <body> and closing </body> tags. Important for accessibility and SEO, these elements identify the purpose or structure of that content.



Element
Description




<blockquote>
Indicates that the enclosed text is an extended quotation. Usually, this is rendered visually by indentation. A URL for the source of the quotation may be given using the cite attribute, while a text representation of the source can be given using the <cite> element.


<dd>
Provides the description, definition, or value for the preceding term (<dt>) in a description list (<dl>).


<div>
The generic container for flow content. It has no effect on the content or layout until styled in some way using CSS (e.g., styling is directly applied to it, or some kind of layout model like flexbox is applied to its parent element).


<dl>
Represents a description list. The element encloses a list of groups of terms (specified using the <dt> element) and descriptions (provided by <dd> elements). Common uses for this element are to implement a glossary or to display metadata (a list of key-value pairs).


<dt>
Specifies a term in a description or definition list, and as such must be used inside a <dl> element. It is usually followed by a <dd> element; however, multiple <dt> elements in a row indicate several terms that are all defined by the immediate next <dd> element.


<figcaption>
Represents a caption or legend describing the rest of the contents of its parent <figure> element.


<figure>
Represents self-contained content, potentially with an optional caption, which is specified using the <figcaption> element. The figure, its caption, and its contents are referenced as a single unit.


<hr>
Represents a thematic break between paragraph-level elements: for example, a change of scene in a story, or a shift of topic within a section.


<li>
Represents an item in a list. It must be contained in a parent element: an ordered list (<ol>), an unordered list (<ul>), or a menu (<menu>). In menus and unordered lists, list items are usually displayed using bullet points. In ordered lists, they are usually displayed with an ascending counter on the left, such as a number or letter.


<menu>
A semantic alternative to <ul>, but treated by browsers (and exposed through the accessibility tree) as no different than <ul>. It represents an unordered list of items (which are represented by <li> elements).


<ol>
Represents an ordered list of items — typically rendered as a numbered list.


<p>
Represents a paragraph. Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields.


<pre>
Represents preformatted text which is to be presented exactly as written in the HTML file. The text is typically rendered using a non-proportional, or monospaced, font. Whitespace inside this element is displayed as written.


<ul>
Represents an unordered list of items, typically rendered as a bulleted list.


Inline text semanticsUse the HTML inline text semantic to define the meaning, structure, or style of a word, line, or any arbitrary piece of text.



Element
Description




<a>
Together with its href attribute, creates a hyperlink to web pages, files, email addresses, locations within the current page, or anything else a URL can address.


<abbr>
Represents an abbreviation or acronym.


<b>
Used to draw the reader's attention to the element's contents, which are not otherwise granted special importance. This was formerly known as the Boldface element, and most browsers still draw the text in boldface. However, you should not use <b> for styling text or granting importance. If you wish to create boldface text, you should use the CSS font-weight property. If you wish to indicate an element is of special importance, you should use the <strong> element.


<bdi>
Tells the browser's bidirectional algorithm to treat the text it contains in isolation from its surrounding text. It's particularly useful when a website dynamically inserts some text and doesn't know the directionality of the text being inserted.


<bdo>
Overrides the current directionality of text, so that the text within is rendered in a different direction.


<br>
Produces a line break in text (carriage-return). It is useful for writing a poem or an address, where the division of lines is significant.


<cite>
Used to mark up the title of a creative work. The reference may be in an abbreviated form according to context-appropriate conventions related to citation metadata.


<code>
Displays its contents styled in a fashion intended to indicate that the text is a short fragment of computer code. By default, the content text is displayed using the user agent's default monospace font.


<data>
Links a given piece of content with a machine-readable translation. If the content is time- or date-related, the <time> element must be used.


<dfn>
Used to indicate the term being defined within the context of a definition phrase or sentence. The ancestor <p> element, the <dt>/<dd> pairing, or the nearest section ancestor of the <dfn> element, is considered to be the definition of the term.


<em>
Marks text that has stress emphasis. The <em> element can be nested, with each nesting level indicating a greater degree of emphasis.


<i>
Represents a range of text that is set off from the normal text for some reason, such as idiomatic text, technical terms, and taxonomical designations, among others. Historically, these have been presented using italicized type, which is the original source of the <i> naming of this element.


<kbd>
Represents a span of inline text denoting textual user input from a keyboard, voice input, or any other text entry device. By convention, the user agent defaults to rendering the contents of a <kbd> element using its default monospace font, although this is not mandated by the HTML standard.


<mark>
Represents text which is marked or highlighted for reference or notation purposes due to the marked passage's relevance in the enclosing context.


<q>
Indicates that the enclosed text is a short inline quotation. Most modern browsers implement this by surrounding the text in quotation marks. This element is intended for short quotations that don't require paragraph breaks; for long quotations use the <blockquote> element.


<rp>
Used to provide fall-back parentheses for browsers that do not support the display of ruby annotations using the <ruby> element. One <rp> element should enclose each of the opening and closing parentheses that wrap the <rt> element that contains the annotation's text.


<rt>
Specifies the ruby text component of a ruby annotation, which is used to provide pronunciation, translation, or transliteration information for East Asian typography. The <rt> element must always be contained within a <ruby> element.


<ruby>
Represents small annotations that are rendered above, below, or next to base text, usually used for showing the pronunciation of East Asian characters. It can also be used for annotating other kinds of text, but this usage is less common.


<s>
Renders text with a strikethrough, or a line through it. Use the <s> element to represent things that are no longer relevant or no longer accurate. However, <s> is not appropriate when indicating document edits; for that, use the <del> and <ins> elements, as appropriate.


<samp>
Used to enclose inline text which represents sample (or quoted) output from a computer program. Its contents are typically rendered using the browser's default monospaced font (such as Courier or Lucida Console).


<small>
Represents side-comments and small print, like copyright and legal text, independent of its styled presentation. By default, it renders text within it one font size smaller, such as from small to x-small.


<span>
A generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the class or id attributes), or because they share attribute values, such as lang. It should be used only when no other semantic element is appropriate. <span> is very much like a div element, but div is a block-level element whereas a <span> is an inline-level element.


<strong>
Indicates that its contents have strong importance, seriousness, or urgency. Browsers typically render the contents in bold type.


<sub>
Specifies inline text which should be displayed as subscript for solely typographical reasons. Subscripts are typically rendered with a lowered baseline using smaller text.


<sup>
Specifies inline text which is to be displayed as superscript for solely typographical reasons. Superscripts are usually rendered with a raised baseline using smaller text.


<time>
Represents a specific period in time. It may include the datetime attribute to translate dates into machine-readable format, allowing for better search engine results or custom features such as reminders.


<u>
Represents a span of inline text which should be rendered in a way that indicates that it has a non-textual annotation. This is rendered by default as a single solid underline but may be altered using CSS.


<var>
Represents the name of a variable in a mathematical expression or a programming context. It's typically presented using an italicized version of the current typeface, although that behavior is browser-dependent.


<wbr>
Represents a word break opportunity—a position within text where the browser may optionally break a line, though its line-breaking rules would not otherwise create a break at that location.


Image and multimediaHTML supports various multimedia resources such as images, audio, and video.



Element
Description




<area>
Defines an area inside an image map that has predefined clickable areas. An image map allows geometric areas on an image to be associated with hyperlink.


<audio>
Used to embed sound content in documents. It may contain one or more audio sources, represented using the src attribute or the source element: the browser will choose the most suitable one. It can also be the destination for streamed media, using a MediaStream.


<img>
Embeds an image into the document.


<map>
Used with <area> elements to define an image map (a clickable link area).


<track>
Used as a child of the media elements, audio and video. It lets you specify timed text tracks (or time-based data), for example to automatically handle subtitles. The tracks are formatted in WebVTT format (.vtt files)—Web Video Text Tracks.


<video>
Embeds a media player which supports video playback into the document. You can also use <video> for audio content, but the audio element may provide a more appropriate user experience.


Embedded contentIn addition to regular multimedia content, HTML can include a variety of other content, even if it's not always easy to interact with.



Element
Description




<embed>
Embeds external content at the specified point in the document. This content is provided by an external application or other source of interactive content such as a browser plug-in.


<fencedframe>
Represents a nested browsing context, like <iframe> but with more native privacy features built in.


<iframe>
Represents a nested browsing context, embedding another HTML page into the current one.


<object>
Represents an external resource, which can be treated as an image, a nested browsing context, or a resource to be handled by a plugin.


<picture>
Contains zero or more <source> elements and one <img> element to offer alternative versions of an image for different display/device scenarios.


<source>
Specifies multiple media resources for the picture, the audio element, or the video element. It is a void element, meaning that it has no content and does not have a closing tag. It is commonly used to offer the same media content in multiple file formats in order to provide compatibility with a broad range of browsers given their differing support for image file formats and media file formats.


SVG and MathMLYou can embed SVG and MathML content directly into HTML documents, using the <svg> and <math> elements.



Element
Description




<svg>
Container defining a new coordinate system and viewport. It is used as the outermost element of SVG documents, but it can also be used to embed an SVG fragment inside an SVG or HTML document.


<math>
The top-level element in MathML. Every valid MathML instance must be wrapped in it. In addition, you must not nest a second <math> element in another, but you can have an arbitrary number of other child elements in it.


ScriptingTo create dynamic content and Web applications, HTML supports the use of scripting languages, most prominently JavaScript. Certain elements support this capability.



Element
Description




<canvas>
Container element to use with either the canvas scripting API or the WebGL API to draw graphics and animations.


<noscript>
Defines a section of HTML to be inserted if a script type on the page is unsupported or if scripting is currently turned off in the browser.


<script>
Used to embed executable code or data; this is typically used to embed or refer to JavaScript code. The <script> element can also be used with other languages, such as WebGL's GLSL shader programming language and JSON.


Demarcating editsThese elements let you provide indications that specific parts of the text have been altered.



Element
Description




<del>
Represents a range of text that has been deleted from a document. This can be used when rendering "track changes" or source code diff information, for example. The <ins> element can be used for the opposite purpose: to indicate text that has been added to the document.


<ins>
Represents a range of text that has been added to a document. You can use the <del> element to similarly represent a range of text that has been deleted from the document.


Table contentThe elements here are used to create and handle tabular data.



Element
Description




<caption>
Specifies the caption (or title) of a table.


<col>
Defines one or more columns in a column group represented by its implicit or explicit parent <colgroup> element. The <col> element is only valid as a child of a <colgroup> element that has no span attribute defined.

This element was deprecated in HTML 4.01 and above in favor of placing fallback content between the opening and closing tags of an <object> element.


<noframes>
Provides content to be presented in browsers that don't support (or have disabled support for) the <frame> element. Although most commonly-used browsers support frames, there are exceptions, including certain special-use browsers including some mobile browsers, as well as text-mode browsers.


<param>
Defines parameters for an <object> element.


<plaintext>
Renders everything following the start tag as raw text, ignoring any following HTML. There is no closing tag, since everything after it is considered raw text.


<rb>
Used to delimit the base text component of a ruby annotation, i.e., the text that is being annotated. One <rb> element should wrap each separate atomic segment of the base text.


<rtc>
Embraces semantic annotations of characters presented in a ruby of <rb> elements used inside of <ruby> element. <rb> elements can have both pronunciation (<rt>) and semantic (<rtc>) annotations.


<shadow>
An obsolete part of the Web Components technology suite that was intended to be used as a shadow DOM insertion point. You might have used it if you have created multiple shadow roots under a shadow host. Consider using <slot> instead.


<strike>
Places a strikethrough (horizontal line) over text.


<tt>
Creates inline text which is presented using the user agent default monospace font face. This element was created for the purpose of rendering text as it would be displayed on a fixed-width display such as a teletype, text-only screen, or line printer.


<xmp>
Renders text between the start and end tags without interpreting the HTML in between and using a monospaced font. The HTML2 specification recommended that it should be rendered wide enough to allow 80 characters per line.

They are grouped by function to help you find what you have in mind easily. An alphabetical list of all elements is provided in the sidebar on every element's page as well as this one.

Note:
For more information about the basics of HTML elements and attributes, see Anatomy of an HTML element.
Main root


Element
Description




<html>
Represents the root (top-level element) of an HTML document, so it is also referred to as the root element. All other elements must be descendants of this element.


Document metadataMetadata contains information about the page. This includes information about styles, scripts and data to help software (search engines, browsers, etc.) use and render the page. Metadata for styles and scripts may be defined in the page or linked to another file that has the information.



Element
Description




<base>
Specifies the base URL to use for all relative URLs in a document. There can be only one such element in a document.


<head>
Contains machine-readable information (metadata) about the document, like its title, scripts, and style sheets.


<link>
Specifies relationships between the current document and an external resource. This element is most commonly used to link to CSS but is also used to establish site icons (both "favicon" style icons and icons for the home screen and apps on mobile devices) among other things.


<meta>
Represents metadata that cannot be represented by other HTML meta-related elements, like <base>, <link>, <script>, <style> and <title>.


<style>
Contains style information for a document or part of a document. It contains CSS, which is applied to the contents of the document containing this element.


<title>
Defines the document's title that is shown in a browser's title bar or a page's tab. It only contains text; HTML tags within the element, if any, are also treated as plain text.


Sectioning root


Element
Description




<body>
Represents the content of an HTML document. There can be only one such element in a document.


Content sectioningContent sectioning elements allow you to organize the document content into logical pieces. Use the sectioning elements to create a broad outline for your page content, including header and footer navigation, and heading elements to identify sections of content.



Element
Description




<address>
Indicates that the enclosed HTML provides contact information for a person or people, or for an organization.


<article>
Represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication). Examples include a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, a blog entry, a product card, a user-submitted comment, an interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent item of content.


<aside>
Represents a portion of a document whose content is only indirectly related to the document's main content. Asides are frequently presented as sidebars or call-out boxes.


<footer>
Represents a footer for its nearest ancestor sectioning content or sectioning root element. A <footer> typically contains information about the author of the section, copyright data, or links to related documents.


<header>
Represents introductory content, typically a group of introductory or navigational aids. It may contain some heading elements but also a logo, a search form, an author name, and other elements.


<h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>
Represent six levels of section headings. <h1> is the highest section level and <h6> is the lowest.


<hgroup>
Represents a heading grouped with any secondary content, such as subheadings, an alternative title, or a tagline.


<main>
Represents the dominant content of the body of a document. The main content area consists of content that is directly related to or expands upon the central topic of a document, or the central functionality of an application.


<nav>
Represents a section of a page whose purpose is to provide navigation links, either within the current document or to other documents. Common examples of navigation sections are menus, tables of contents, and indexes.


<section>
Represents a generic standalone section of a document, which doesn't have a more specific semantic element to represent it. Sections should always have a heading, with very few exceptions.


<search>
Represents a part that contains a set of form controls or other content related to performing a search or filtering operation.


Text contentUse HTML text content elements to organize blocks or sections of content placed between the opening <body> and closing </body> tags. Important for accessibility and SEO, these elements identify the purpose or structure of that content.



Element
Description




<blockquote>
Indicates that the enclosed text is an extended quotation. Usually, this is rendered visually by indentation. A URL for the source of the quotation may be given using the cite attribute, while a text representation of the source can be given using the <cite> element.


<dd>
Provides the description, definition, or value for the preceding term (<dt>) in a description list (<dl>).


<div>
The generic container for flow content. It has no effect on the content or layout until styled in some way using CSS (e.g., styling is directly applied to it, or some kind of layout model like flexbox is applied to its parent element).


<dl>
Represents a description list. The element encloses a list of groups of terms (specified using the <dt> element) and descriptions (provided by <dd> elements). Common uses for this element are to implement a glossary or to display metadata (a list of key-value pairs).


<dt>
Specifies a term in a description or definition list, and as such must be used inside a <dl> element. It is usually followed by a <dd> element; however, multiple <dt> elements in a row indicate several terms that are all defined by the immediate next <dd> element.


<figcaption>
Represents a caption or legend describing the rest of the contents of its parent <figure> element.


<figure>
Represents self-contained content, potentially with an optional caption, which is specified using the <figcaption> element. The figure, its caption, and its contents are referenced as a single unit.


<hr>
Represents a thematic break between paragraph-level elements: for example, a change of scene in a story, or a shift of topic within a section.


<li>
Represents an item in a list. It must be contained in a parent element: an ordered list (<ol>), an unordered list (<ul>), or a menu (<menu>). In menus and unordered lists, list items are usually displayed using bullet points. In ordered lists, they are usually displayed with an ascending counter on the left, such as a number or letter.


<menu>
A semantic alternative to <ul>, but treated by browsers (and exposed through the accessibility tree) as no different than <ul>. It represents an unordered list of items (which are represented by <li> elements).


<ol>
Represents an ordered list of items — typically rendered as a numbered list.


<p>
Represents a paragraph. Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields.


<pre>
Represents preformatted text which is to be presented exactly as written in the HTML file. The text is typically rendered using a non-proportional, or monospaced, font. Whitespace inside this element is displayed as written.


<ul>
Represents an unordered list of items, typically rendered as a bulleted list.


Inline text semanticsUse the HTML inline text semantic to define the meaning, structure, or style of a word, line, or any arbitrary piece of text.



Element
Description




<a>
Together with its href attribute, creates a hyperlink to web pages, files, email addresses, locations within the current page, or anything else a URL can address.


<abbr>
Represents an abbreviation or acronym.


<b>
Used to draw the reader's attention to the element's contents, which are not otherwise granted special importance. This was formerly known as the Boldface element, and most browsers still draw the text in boldface. However, you should not use <b> for styling text or granting importance. If you wish to create boldface text, you should use the CSS font-weight property. If you wish to indicate an element is of special importance, you should use the <strong> element.


<bdi>
Tells the browser's bidirectional algorithm to treat the text it contains in isolation from its surrounding text. It's particularly useful when a website dynamically inserts some text and doesn't know the directionality of the text being inserted.


<bdo>
Overrides the current directionality of text, so that the text within is rendered in a different direction.


<br>
Produces a line break in text (carriage-return). It is useful for writing a poem or an address, where the division of lines is significant.


<cite>
Used to mark up the title of a creative work. The reference may be in an abbreviated form according to context-appropriate conventions related to citation metadata.


<code>
Displays its contents styled in a fashion intended to indicate that the text is a short fragment of computer code. By default, the content text is displayed using the user agent's default monospace font.


<data>
Links a given piece of content with a machine-readable translation. If the content is time- or date-related, the <time> element must be used.


<dfn>
Used to indicate the term being defined within the context of a definition phrase or sentence. The ancestor <p> element, the <dt>/<dd> pairing, or the nearest section ancestor of the <dfn> element, is considered to be the definition of the term.


<em>
Marks text that has stress emphasis. The <em> element can be nested, with each nesting level indicating a greater degree of emphasis.


<i>
Represents a range of text that is set off from the normal text for some reason, such as idiomatic text, technical terms, and taxonomical designations, among others. Historically, these have been presented using italicized type, which is the original source of the <i> naming of this element.


<kbd>
Represents a span of inline text denoting textual user input from a keyboard, voice input, or any other text entry device. By convention, the user agent defaults to rendering the contents of a <kbd> element using its default monospace font, although this is not mandated by the HTML standard.


<mark>
Represents text which is marked or highlighted for reference or notation purposes due to the marked passage's relevance in the enclosing context.


<q>
Indicates that the enclosed text is a short inline quotation. Most modern browsers implement this by surrounding the text in quotation marks. This element is intended for short quotations that don't require paragraph breaks; for long quotations use the <blockquote> element.


<rp>
Used to provide fall-back parentheses for browsers that do not support the display of ruby annotations using the <ruby> element. One <rp> element should enclose each of the opening and closing parentheses that wrap the <rt> element that contains the annotation's text.


<rt>
Specifies the ruby text component of a ruby annotation, which is used to provide pronunciation, translation, or transliteration information for East Asian typography. The <rt> element must always be contained within a <ruby> element.


<ruby>
Represents small annotations that are rendered above, below, or next to base text, usually used for showing the pronunciation of East Asian characters. It can also be used for annotating other kinds of text, but this usage is less common.


<s>
Renders text with a strikethrough, or a line through it. Use the <s> element to represent things that are no longer relevant or no longer accurate. However, <s> is not appropriate when indicating document edits; for that, use the <del> and <ins> elements, as appropriate.


<samp>
Used to enclose inline text which represents sample (or quoted) output from a computer program. Its contents are typically rendered using the browser's default monospaced font (such as Courier or Lucida Console).


<small>
Represents side-comments and small print, like copyright and legal text, independent of its styled presentation. By default, it renders text within it one font size smaller, such as from small to x-small.


<span>
A generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the class or id attributes), or because they share attribute values, such as lang. It should be used only when no other semantic element is appropriate. <span> is very much like a div element, but div is a block-level element whereas a <span> is an inline-level element.


<strong>
Indicates that its contents have strong importance, seriousness, or urgency. Browsers typically render the contents in bold type.


<sub>
Specifies inline text which should be displayed as subscript for solely typographical reasons. Subscripts are typically rendered with a lowered baseline using smaller text.


<sup>
Specifies inline text which is to be displayed as superscript for solely typographical reasons. Superscripts are usually rendered with a raised baseline using smaller text.


<time>
Represents a specific period in time. It may include the datetime attribute to translate dates into machine-readable format, allowing for better search engine results or custom features such as reminders.


<u>
Represents a span of inline text which should be rendered in a way that indicates that it has a non-textual annotation. This is rendered by default as a single solid underline but may be altered using CSS.


<var>
Represents the name of a variable in a mathematical expression or a programming context. It's typically presented using an italicized version of the current typeface, although that behavior is browser-dependent.


<wbr>
Represents a word break opportunity—a position within text where the browser may optionally break a line, though its line-breaking rules would not otherwise create a break at that location.


Image and multimediaHTML supports various multimedia resources such as images, audio, and video.



Element
Description




<area>
Defines an area inside an image map that has predefined clickable areas. An image map allows geometric areas on an image to be associated with hyperlink.


<audio>
Used to embed sound content in documents. It may contain one or more audio sources, represented using the src attribute or the source element: the browser will choose the most suitable one. It can also be the destination for streamed media, using a MediaStream.


<img>
Embeds an image into the document.


<map>
Used with <area> elements to define an image map (a clickable link area).


<track>
Used as a child of the media elements, audio and video. It lets you specify timed text tracks (or time-based data), for example to automatically handle subtitles. The tracks are formatted in WebVTT format (.vtt files)—Web Video Text Tracks.


<video>
Embeds a media player which supports video playback into the document. You can also use <video> for audio content, but the audio element may provide a more appropriate user experience.


Embedded contentIn addition to regular multimedia content, HTML can include a variety of other content, even if it's not always easy to interact with.



Element
Description




<embed>
Embeds external content at the specified point in the document. This content is provided by an external application or other source of interactive content such as a browser plug-in.


<fencedframe>
Represents a nested browsing context, like <iframe> but with more native privacy features built in.


<iframe>
Represents a nested browsing context, embedding another HTML page into the current one.


<object>
Represents an external resource, which can be treated as an image, a nested browsing context, or a resource to be handled by a plugin.


<picture>
Contains zero or more <source> elements and one <img> element to offer alternative versions of an image for different display/device scenarios.


<source>
Specifies multiple media resources for the picture, the audio element, or the video element. It is a void element, meaning that it has no content and does not have a closing tag. It is commonly used to offer the same media content in multiple file formats in order to provide compatibility with a broad range of browsers given their differing support for image file formats and media file formats.


SVG and MathMLYou can embed SVG and MathML content directly into HTML documents, using the <svg> and <math> elements.



Element
Description




<svg>
Container defining a new coordinate system and viewport. It is used as the outermost element of SVG documents, but it can also be used to embed an SVG fragment inside an SVG or HTML document.


<math>
The top-level element in MathML. Every valid MathML instance must be wrapped in it. In addition, you must not nest a second <math> element in another, but you can have an arbitrary number of other child elements in it.


ScriptingTo create dynamic content and Web applications, HTML supports the use of scripting languages, most prominently JavaScript. Certain elements support this capability.



Element
Description




<canvas>
Container element to use with either the canvas scripting API or the WebGL API to draw graphics and animations.


<noscript>
Defines a section of HTML to be inserted if a script type on the page is unsupported or if scripting is currently turned off in the browser.


<script>
Used to embed executable code or data; this is typically used to embed or refer to JavaScript code. The <script> element can also be used with other languages, such as WebGL's GLSL shader programming language and JSON.


Demarcating editsThese elements let you provide indications that specific parts of the text have been altered.



Element
Description




<del>
Represents a range of text that has been deleted from a document. This can be used when rendering "track changes" or source code diff information, for example. The <ins> element can be used for the opposite purpose: to indicate text that has been added to the document.


<ins>
Represents a range of text that has been added to a document. You can use the <del> element to similarly represent a range of text that has been deleted from the document.


Table contentThe elements here are used to create and handle tabular data.



Element
Description




<caption>
Specifies the caption (or title) of a table.


<col>
Defines one or more columns in a column group represented by its implicit or explicit parent <colgroup> element. The <col> element is only valid as a child of a <colgroup> element that has no span attribute defined.


<colgroup>
Defines a group of columns within a table.


<table>
Represents tabular data—that is, information presented in a two-dimensional table comprised of rows and columns of cells containing data.


<tbody>
Encapsulates a set of table rows (<tr> elements), indicating that they comprise the body of a table's (main) data.


<td>
A child of the <tr> element, it defines a cell of a table that contains data.


<tfoot>
Encapsulates a set of table rows (<tr> elements), indicating that they comprise the foot of a table with information about the table's columns. This is usually a summary of the columns, e.g., a sum of the given numbers in a column.


<th>
A child of the <tr> element, it defines a cell as the header of a group of table cells. The nature of this group can be explicitly defined by the scope and headers attributes.


<thead>
Encapsulates a set of table rows (<tr> elements), indicating that they comprise the head of a table with information about the table's columns. This is usually in the form of column headers (<th> elements).


<tr>
Defines a row of cells in a table. The row's cells can then be established using a mix of <td> (data cell) and <th> (header cell) elements.


FormsHTML provides several elements that can be used together to create forms that the user can fill out and submit to the website or application. Further information about this available in the HTML forms guide.



Element
Description




<button>
An interactive element activated by a user with a mouse, keyboard, finger, voice command, or other assistive technology. Once activated, it performs an action, such as submitting a form or opening a dialog.


<datalist>
Contains a set of <option> elements that represent the permissible or recommended options available to choose from within other controls.


<fieldset>
Used to group several controls as well as labels (<label>) within a web form.


<form>
Represents a document section containing interactive controls for submitting information.


<input>
Used to create interactive controls for web-based forms to accept data from the user; a wide variety of types of input data and control widgets are available, depending on the device and user agent. The <input> element is one of the most powerful and complex in all of HTML due to the sheer number of combinations of input types and attributes.


<label>
Represents a caption for an item in a user interface.


<legend>
Represents a caption for the content of its parent <fieldset>.


<meter>
Represents either a scalar value within a known range or a fractional value.


<optgroup>
Creates a grouping of options within a <select> element.


<option>
Used to define an item contained in a select, an <optgroup>, or a <datalist> element. As such, <option> can represent menu items in popups and other lists of items in an HTML document.


<output>
Container element into which a site or app can inject the results of a calculation or the outcome of a user action.


<progress>
Displays an indicator showing the completion progress of a task, typically displayed as a progress bar.


<select>
Represents a control that provides a menu of options.


<selectedcontent>
Displays the content of the currently selected <option> inside a closed <select> element.


<textarea>
Represents a multi-line plain-text editing control, useful when you want to allow users to enter a sizeable amount of free-form text, for example, a comment on a review or feedback form.


Interactive elementsHTML offers a selection of elements that help to create interactive user interface objects.



Element
Description




<details>
Creates a disclosure widget in which information is visible only when the widget is toggled into an "open" state. A summary or label must be provided using the <summary> element.


<dialog>
Represents a dialog box or other interactive component, such as a dismissible alert, inspector, or subwindow.


<summary>
Specifies a summary, caption, or legend for a details element's disclosure box. Clicking the <summary> element toggles the state of the parent <details> element open and closed.


Web ComponentsWeb Components is an HTML-related technology that makes it possible to, essentially, create and use custom elements as if it were regular HTML. In addition, you can create custom versions of standard HTML elements.



Element
Description




<slot>
Part of the Web Components technology suite, this element is a placeholder inside a web component that you can fill with your own markup, which lets you create separate DOM trees and present them together.


<template>
A mechanism for holding HTML that is not to be rendered immediately when a page is loaded but may be instantiated subsequently during runtime using JavaScript.


Obsolete and deprecated elements
Warning:
These are old HTML elements that are deprecated and should not be used. You should never use them in new projects, and you should replace them in old projects as soon as you can. They are listed here for completeness only.




Element
Description




<acronym>
Allows authors to clearly indicate a sequence of characters that compose an acronym or abbreviation for a word.


<big>
Renders the enclosed text at a font size one level larger than the surrounding text (medium becomes large, for example). The size is capped at the browser's maximum permitted font size.


<center>
Displays its block-level or inline contents centered horizontally within its containing element.


<content>
An obsolete part of the Web Components suite of technologies—was used inside of Shadow DOM as an insertion point, and wasn't meant to be used in ordinary HTML. It has now been replaced by the <slot> element, which creates a point in the DOM at which a shadow DOM can be inserted. Consider using <slot> instead.


<dir>
Container for a directory of files and/or folders, potentially with styles and icons applied by the user agent. Do not use this obsolete element; instead, you should use the <ul> element for lists, including lists of files.


<font>
Defines the font size, color and face for its content.


<frame>
Defines a particular area in which another HTML document can be displayed. A frame should be used within a <frameset>.


<frameset>
Used to contain <frame> elements.


<image>
An ancient and poorly supported precursor to the <img> element. It should not be used.


<marquee>
Used to insert a scrolling area of text. You can control what happens when the text reaches the edges of its content area using its attributes.


<menuitem>
Represents a command that a user is able to invoke through a popup menu. This includes context menus, as well as menus that might be attached to a menu button.


<nobr>
Prevents the text it contains from automatically wrapping across multiple lines, potentially resulting in the user having to scroll horizontally to see the entire width of the text.


<noembed>
An obsolete, non-standard way to provide alternative, or "fallback", content for browsers that do not support the embed element or do not support the type of embedded content an author wishes to use. This element was deprecated in HTML 4.01 and above in favor of placing fallback content between the opening and closing tags of an <object> element.


<noframes>
Provides content to be presented in browsers that don't support (or have disabled support for) the <frame> element. Although most commonly-used browsers support frames, there are exceptions, including certain special-use browsers including some mobile browsers, as well as text-mode browsers.


<param>
Defines parameters for an <object> element.


<plaintext>
Renders everything following the start tag as raw text, ignoring any following HTML. There is no closing tag, since everything after it is considered raw text.


<rb>
Used to delimit the base text component of a ruby annotation, i.e., the text that is being annotated. One <rb> element should wrap each separate atomic segment of the base text.


<rtc>
Embraces semantic annotations of characters presented in a ruby of <rb> elements used inside of <ruby> element. <rb> elements can have both pronunciation (<rt>) and semantic (<rtc>) annotations.


<shadow>
An obsolete part of the Web Components technology suite that was intended to be used as a shadow DOM insertion point. You might have used it if you have created multiple shadow roots under a shadow host. Consider using <slot> instead.


<strike>
Places a strikethrough (horizontal line) over text.


<tt>
Creates inline text which is presented using the user agent default monospace font face. This element was created for the purpose of rendering text as it would be displayed on a fixed-width display such as a teletype, text-only screen, or line printer.


<xmp>
Renders text between the start and end tags without interpreting the HTML in between and using a monospaced font. The HTML2 specification recommended that it should be rendered wide enough to allow 80 characters per line.

AttributesThis element's attributes include the global attributes.

attributionsrc 
Experimental


Specifies that you want the browser to send an Attribution-Reporting-Eligible header. On the server-side this is used to trigger sending an Attribution-Reporting-Register-Source header in the response, to register a navigation-based attribution source.
The browser stores the source data associated with the navigation-based attribution source (as provided in the Attribution-Reporting-Register-Source response header) when the user clicks the link. See the Attribution Reporting API for more details.
There are two versions of this attribute that you can set:


Boolean, i.e., just the attributionsrc name. This specifies that you want the Attribution-Reporting-Eligible header sent to the same server as the href attribute points to. This is fine when you are handling the attribution source registration on the same server.


Value containing one or more URLs, for example:
htmlattributionsrc="https://a.example/register-source
https://b.example/register-source"

This is useful in cases where the requested resource is not on a server you control, or you just want to handle registering the attribution source on a different server. In this case, you can specify one or more URLs as the value of attributionsrc. When the resource request occurs, the Attribution-Reporting-Eligible header will be sent to the URL(s) specified in attributionsrc in addition to the resource origin. These URLs can then respond with the Attribution-Reporting-Register-Source to complete registration.

Note:
Specifying multiple URLs means that multiple attribution sources can be registered on the same feature. You might for example have different campaigns that you are trying to measure the success of, which involve generating different reports on different data.



<a> elements cannot be used as attribution triggers, only sources.

download

Causes the browser to treat the linked URL as a download. Can be used with or without a filename value:


Without a value, the browser will suggest a filename/extension, generated from various sources:

The Content-Disposition HTTP header
The final segment in the URL path
The media type (from the Content-Type header, the start of a data: URL, or Blob.type for a blob: URL)



filename: defining a value suggests it as the filename. / and \ characters are converted to underscores (_). Filesystems may forbid other characters in filenames, so browsers will adjust the suggested name if necessary.



Note:


download only works for same-origin URLs, or the blob: and data: schemes.


How browsers treat downloads varies by browser, user settings, and other factors. The user may be prompted before a download starts, or the file may be saved automatically, or it may open automatically, either in an external application or in the browser itself.


If the Content-Disposition header has different information from the download attribute, resulting behavior may differ:

If the header specifies a filename, it takes priority over a filename specified in the download attribute.
If the header specifies a disposition of inline, Chrome and Firefox prioritize the attribute and treat it as a download. Old Firefox versions (before 82) prioritize the header and will display the content inline.





href

The URL that the hyperlink points to. Links are not restricted to HTTP-based URLs — they can use any URL scheme supported by browsers:

Telephone numbers with tel: URLs
Email addresses with mailto: URLs
SMS text messages with sms: URLs
Executable code with javascript: URLs
While web browsers may not support other URL schemes, websites can with registerProtocolHandler()

Moreover other URL features can locate specific parts of the resource, including:

Sections of a page with document fragments
Specific text portions with text fragments
Pieces of media files with media fragments


hreflang

Hints at the human language of the linked URL. No built-in functionality. Allowed values are the same as the global lang attribute.

ping

A space-separated list of URLs. When the link is followed, the browser will send POST requests with the body PING to the URLs. Typically for tracking.

referrerpolicy

How much of the referrer to send when following the link.

no-referrer: The Referer header will not be sent.
no-referrer-when-downgrade: The Referer header will not be sent to origins without TLS (HTTPS).
origin: The sent referrer will be limited to the origin of the referring page: its scheme, host, and port.
origin-when-cross-origin: The referrer sent to other origins will be limited to the scheme, the host, and the port. Navigations on the same origin will still include the path.
same-origin: A referrer will be sent for same origin, but cross-origin requests will contain no referrer information.
strict-origin: Only send the origin of the document as the referrer when the protocol security level stays the same (HTTPS→HTTPS), but don't send it to a less secure destination (HTTPS→HTTP).
strict-origin-when-cross-origin (default): Send a full URL when performing a same-origin request, only send the origin when the protocol security level stays the same (HTTPS→HTTPS), and send no header to a less secure destination (HTTPS→HTTP).
unsafe-url: The referrer will include the origin and the path (but not the fragment, password, or username). This value is unsafe, because it leaks origins and paths from TLS-protected resources to insecure origins.


rel

The relationship of the linked URL as space-separated link types.

target

Where to display the linked URL, as the name for a browsing context (a tab, window, or <iframe>). The following keywords have special meanings for where to load the URL:

_self: The current browsing context. (Default)
_blank: Usually a new tab, but users can configure browsers to open a new window instead.
_parent: The parent browsing context of the current one. If no parent, behaves as _self.
_top: The topmost browsing context. To be specific, this means the "highest" context that's an ancestor of the current one. If no ancestors, behaves as _self.
_unfencedTop: Allows embedded fenced frames to navigate the top-level frame (i.e., traversing beyond the root of the fenced frame, unlike other reserved destinations). Note that the navigation will still succeed if this is used outside of a fenced frame context, but it will not act like a reserved keyword.


Note:
Setting target="_blank" on <a> elements implicitly provides the same rel behavior as setting rel="noopener" which does not set window.opener.


type

Hints at the linked URL's format with a MIME type. No built-in functionality.

Deprecated attributes
charset

AccessibilityStrong link textThe content inside a link should indicate where the link goes, even out of context.

Assistive software has shortcuts to list all links on a page. However, strong link text benefits all users — the "list all links" shortcut emulates how sighted users quickly scan pages.onclick eventsAnchor elements are often abused as fake buttons by setting their href to # or javascript:void(0) to prevent the page from refreshing, then listening for their click events.
These bogus href values cause unexpected behavior when copying/dragging links, opening links in a new tab/window, bookmarking, or when JavaScript is loading, errors, or is disabled. They also convey incorrect semantics to assistive technologies, like screen readers.
Use a <button> instead. In general, you should only use a hyperlink for navigation to a real URL.External links and linking to non-HTML resourcesLinks that open in a new tab/window via target="_blank", or links that point to a download file should indicate what will happen when the link is followed.
People experiencing low vision conditions, navigating with the aid of screen reading technology, or with cognitive concerns may be confused when a new tab, window, or application opens unexpectedly. Older screen-reading software may not even announce the behavior.

Interactive elements, like links, should provide an area large enough that it is easy to activate them. This helps a variety of people, including those with motor control issues and those using imprecise inputs such as a touchscreen. A minimum size of 44×44 CSS pixels is recommended.
Text-only links in prose content are exempt from this requirement, but it's still a good idea to make sure enough text is hyperlinked to be easily activated.

AttributesThis element's attributes include the global attributes.

attributionsrc 
Experimental


Specifies that you want the browser to send an Attribution-Reporting-Eligible header. On the server-side this is used to trigger sending an Attribution-Reporting-Register-Source header in the response, to register a navigation-based attribution source.
The browser stores the source data associated with the navigation-based attribution source (as provided in the Attribution-Reporting-Register-Source response header) when the user clicks the link. See the Attribution Reporting API for more details.
There are two versions of this attribute that you can set:


Boolean, i.e., just the attributionsrc name. This specifies that you want the Attribution-Reporting-Eligible header sent to the same server as the href attribute points to. This is fine when you are handling the attribution source registration on the same server.


Value containing one or more URLs, for example:
htmlattributionsrc="https://a.example/register-source
https://b.example/register-source"

This is useful in cases where the requested resource is not on a server you control, or you just want to handle registering the attribution source on a different server. In this case, you can specify one or more URLs as the value of attributionsrc. When the resource request occurs, the Attribution-Reporting-Eligible header will be sent to the URL(s) specified in attributionsrc in addition to the resource origin. These URLs can then respond with the Attribution-Reporting-Register-Source to complete registration.

Note:
Specifying multiple URLs means that multiple attribution sources can be registered on the same feature. You might for example have different campaigns that you are trying to measure the success of, which involve generating different reports on different data.



<a> elements cannot be used as attribution triggers, only sources.

download

Causes the browser to treat the linked URL as a download. Can be used with or without a filename value:


Without a value, the browser will suggest a filename/extension, generated from various sources:

The Content-Disposition HTTP header
The final segment in the URL path
The media type (from the Content-Type header, the start of a data: URL, or Blob.type for a blob: URL)



filename: defining a value suggests it as the filename. / and \ characters are converted to underscores (_). Filesystems may forbid other characters in filenames, so browsers will adjust the suggested name if necessary.



Note:


download only works for same-origin URLs, or the blob: and data: schemes.


How browsers treat downloads varies by browser, user settings, and other factors. The user may be prompted before a download starts, or the file may be saved automatically, or it may open automatically, either in an external application or in the browser itself.


If the Content-Disposition header has different information from the download attribute, resulting behavior may differ:

If the header specifies a filename, it takes priority over a filename specified in the download attribute.
If the header specifies a disposition of inline, Chrome and Firefox prioritize the attribute and treat it as a download. Old Firefox versions (before 82) prioritize the header and will display the content inline.





href

The URL that the hyperlink points to. Links are not restricted to HTTP-based URLs — they can use any URL scheme supported by browsers:

Telephone numbers with tel: URLs
Email addresses with mailto: URLs
SMS text messages with sms: URLs
Executable code with javascript: URLs
While web browsers may not support other URL schemes, websites can with registerProtocolHandler()

Moreover other URL features can locate specific parts of the resource, including:

Sections of a page with document fragments
Specific text portions with text fragments
Pieces of media files with media fragments


hreflang

Hints at the human language of the linked URL. No built-in functionality. Allowed values are the same as the global lang attribute.

ping

A space-separated list of URLs. When the link is followed, the browser will send POST requests with the body PING to the URLs. Typically for tracking.

referrerpolicy

How much of the referrer to send when following the link.

no-referrer: The Referer header will not be sent.
no-referrer-when-downgrade: The Referer header will not be sent to origins without TLS (HTTPS).
origin: The sent referrer will be limited to the origin of the referring page: its scheme, host, and port.
origin-when-cross-origin: The referrer sent to other origins will be limited to the scheme, the host, and the port. Navigations on the same origin will still include the path.
same-origin: A referrer will be sent for same origin, but cross-origin requests will contain no referrer information.
strict-origin: Only send the origin of the document as the referrer when the protocol security level stays the same (HTTPS→HTTPS), but don't send it to a less secure destination (HTTPS→HTTP).
strict-origin-when-cross-origin (default): Send a full URL when performing a same-origin request, only send the origin when the protocol security level stays the same (HTTPS→HTTPS), and send no header to a less secure destination (HTTPS→HTTP).
unsafe-url: The referrer will include the origin and the path (but not the fragment, password, or username). This value is unsafe, because it leaks origins and paths from TLS-protected resources to insecure origins.


rel

The relationship of the linked URL as space-separated link types.

target

Where to display the linked URL, as the name for a browsing context (a tab, window, or <iframe>). The following keywords have special meanings for where to load the URL:

_self: The current browsing context. (Default)
_blank: Usually a new tab, but users can configure browsers to open a new window instead.
_parent: The parent browsing context of the current one. If no parent, behaves as _self.
_top: The topmost browsing context. To be specific, this means the "highest" context that's an ancestor of the current one. If no ancestors, behaves as _self.
_unfencedTop: Allows embedded fenced frames to navigate the top-level frame (i.e., traversing beyond the root of the fenced frame, unlike other reserved destinations). Note that the navigation will still succeed if this is used outside of a fenced frame context, but it will not act like a reserved keyword.

AttributesThis element's attributes include the global attributes.

attributionsrc 
Experimental


Specifies that you want the browser to send an Attribution-Reporting-Eligible header. On the server-side this is used to trigger sending an Attribution-Reporting-Register-Source header in the response, to register a navigation-based attribution source.
The browser stores the source data associated with the navigation-based attribution source (as provided in the Attribution-Reporting-Register-Source response header) when the user clicks the link. See the Attribution Reporting API for more details.
There are two versions of this attribute that you can set:


Boolean, i.e., just the attributionsrc name. This specifies that you want the Attribution-Reporting-Eligible header sent to the same server as the href attribute points to. This is fine when you are handling the attribution source registration on the same server.


Value containing one or more URLs, for example:
htmlattributionsrc="https://a.example/register-source
https://b.example/register-source"

This is useful in cases where the requested resource is not on a server you control, or you just want to handle registering the attribution source on a different server. In this case, you can specify one or more URLs as the value of attributionsrc. When the resource request occurs, the Attribution-Reporting-Eligible header will be sent to the URL(s) specified in attributionsrc in addition to the resource origin. These URLs can then respond with the Attribution-Reporting-Register-Source to complete registration.

Note:
Specifying multiple URLs means that multiple attribution sources can be registered on the same feature. You might for example have different campaigns that you are trying to measure the success of, which involve generating different reports on different data.



<a> elements cannot be used as attribution triggers, only sources.

download

Causes the browser to treat the linked URL as a download. Can be used with or without a filename value:


Without a value, the browser will suggest a filename/extension, generated from various sources:

The Content-Disposition HTTP header
The final segment in the URL path
The media type (from the Content-Type header, the start of a data: URL, or Blob.type for a blob: URL)



filename: defining a value suggests it as the filename. / and \ characters are converted to underscores (_). Filesystems may forbid other characters in filenames, so browsers will adjust the suggested name if necessary.



Note:


download only works for same-origin URLs, or the blob: and data: schemes.


How browsers treat downloads varies by browser, user settings, and other factors. The user may be prompted before a download starts, or the file may be saved automatically, or it may open automatically, either in an external application or in the browser itself.


If the Content-Disposition header has different information from the download attribute, resulting behavior may differ:

If the header specifies a filename, it takes priority over a filename specified in the download attribute.
If the header specifies a disposition of inline, Chrome and Firefox prioritize the attribute and treat it as a download. Old Firefox versions (before 82) prioritize the header and will display the content inline.





href

The URL that the hyperlink points to. Links are not restricted to HTTP-based URLs — they can use any URL scheme supported by browsers:

Telephone numbers with tel: URLs
Email addresses with mailto: URLs
SMS text messages with sms: URLs
Executable code with javascript: URLs
While web browsers may not support other URL schemes, websites can with registerProtocolHandler()

Moreover other URL features can locate specific parts of the resource, including:

Sections of a page with document fragments
Specific text portions with text fragments
Pieces of media files with media fragments


hreflang

Hints at the human language of the linked URL. No built-in functionality. Allowed values are the same as the global lang attribute.

ping

A space-separated list of URLs. When the link is followed, the browser will send POST requests with the body PING to the URLs. Typically for tracking.

referrerpolicy

How much of the referrer to send when following the link.

no-referrer: The Referer header will not be sent.
no-referrer-when-downgrade: The Referer header will not be sent to origins without TLS (HTTPS).
origin: The sent referrer will be limited to the origin of the referring page: its scheme, host, and port.
origin-when-cross-origin: The referrer sent to other origins will be limited to the scheme, the host, and the port. Navigations on the same origin will still include the path.
same-origin: A referrer will be sent for same origin, but cross-origin requests will contain no referrer information.
strict-origin: Only send the origin of the document as the referrer when the protocol security level stays the same (HTTPS→HTTPS), but don't send it to a less secure destination (HTTPS→HTTP).
strict-origin-when-cross-origin (default): Send a full URL when performing a same-origin request, only send the origin when the protocol security level stays the same (HTTPS→HTTPS), and send no header to a less secure destination (HTTPS→HTTP).
unsafe-url: The referrer will include the origin and the path (but not the fragment, password, or username). This value is unsafe, because it leaks origins and paths from TLS-protected resources to insecure origins.


rel

The relationship of the linked URL as space-separated link types.

target

Where to display the linked URL, as the name for a browsing context (a tab, window, or <iframe>). The following keywords have special meanings for where to load the URL:

_self: The current browsing context. (Default)
_blank: Usually a new tab, but users can configure browsers to open a new window instead.
_parent: The parent browsing context of the current one. If no parent, behaves as _self.
_top: The topmost browsing context. To be specific, this means the "highest" context that's an ancestor of the current one. If no ancestors, behaves as _self.
_unfencedTop: Allows embedded fenced frames to navigate the top-level frame (i.e., traversing beyond the root of the fenced frame, unlike other reserved destinations). Note that the navigation will still succeed if this is used outside of a fenced frame context, but it will not act like a reserved keyword.


Note:
Setting target="_blank" on <a> elements implicitly provides the same rel behavior as setting rel="noopener" which does not set window.opener.


type

Hints at the linked URL's format with a MIME type. No built-in functionality.

Deprecated attributes
charset 
Deprecated


Hinted at the character encoding of the linked URL.

Note:
This attribute is deprecated and should not be used by authors. Use the HTTP Content-Type header on the linked URL.


coords 
Deprecated


Used with the shape attribute. A comma-separated list of coordinates.

name 
Deprecated


Was required to define a possible target location in a page. In HTML 4.01, id and name could both be used on <a>, as long as they had identical values.

Note:
Use the global attribute id instead.


rev 
Deprecated


Specified a reverse link; the opposite of the rel attribute. Deprecated for being very confusing.

shape 
Deprecated


The shape of the hyperlink's region in an image map.

Note:
Use the <area> element for image maps instead.


AccessibilityStrong link textThe content inside a link should indicate where the link goes, even out of context.
Inaccessible, weak link text
A sadly common mistake is to only link the words "click here" or "here":
html<p>Learn more about our products <a href="/products">here</a>.</p>

Result

Strong link text
Luckily, this is an easy fix, and it's actually shorter than the inaccessible version!
html<p>Learn more <a href="/products">about our products</a>.</p>

Result

Assistive software has shortcuts to list all links on a page. However, strong link text benefits all users — the "list all links" shortcut emulates how sighted users quickly scan pages.onclick eventsAnchor elements are often abused as fake buttons by setting their href to # or javascript:void(0) to prevent the page from refreshing, then listening for their click events.
These bogus href values cause unexpected behavior when copying/dragging links, opening links in a new tab/window, bookmarking, or when JavaScript is loading, errors, or is disabled. They also convey incorrect semantics to assistive technologies, like screen readers.
Use a <button> instead. In general, you should only use a hyperlink for navigation to a real URL.External links and linking to non-HTML resourcesLinks that open in a new tab/window via target="_blank", or links that point to a download file should indicate what will happen when the link is followed.
People experiencing low vision conditions, navigating with the aid of screen reading technology, or with cognitive concerns may be confused when a new tab, window, or application opens unexpectedly. Older screen-reading software may not even announce the behavior.

If an icon is used to signify link behavior, make sure it has an alt attribute to describe its purpose. In case the icon is missing, the alt attribute's content will still convey the link's behavior.

Skip linksA skip link is a link placed as early as possible in <body> content that points to the beginning of the page's main content. Usually, CSS hides a skip link offscreen until focused.
html<body>
  <a href="#content" class="skip-link">Skip to main content</a>

  <!-- The skip link jumps to here -->
  <main id="content"></main>
</body>

css.skip-link {
  position: absolute;
  top: -3em;
  background: #fff;
}
.skip-link:focus {

}

Result

Skip links let keyboard users bypass content repeated throughout multiple pages, such as header navigation.
Skip links are especially useful for people who navigate with the aid of assistive technology such as switch control, voice command, or mouth sticks/head wands, where the act of moving through repetitive links can be laborious.

Understanding Success Criterion 2.4.1
Size and proximitySize
Interactive elements, like links, should provide an area large enough that it is easy to activate them. This helps a variety of people, including those with motor control issues and those using imprecise inputs such as a touchscreen. A minimum size of 44×44 CSS pixels is recommended.
Text-only links in prose content are exempt from this requirement, but it's still a good idea to make sure enough text is hyperlinked to be easily activated.

Understanding Success Criterion 2.5.5: Target Size
Target Size and 2.5.5
Quick test: Large touch targets

Proximity
Interactive elements, like links, placed in close visual proximity should have space separating them. Spacing helps people with motor control issues, who may otherwise accidentally activate the wrong interactive content.
Spacing may be created using CSS properties like margin.

<a href="tel:+1(800)555-0123">(800) 555-0123</a>

Result

tel: link behavior varies with device capabilities:

Cellular devices autodial the number.
Most operating systems have programs that can make calls, like Skype or FaceTime.
Websites can make phone calls with registerProtocolHandler, such as web.skype.com.
Other behaviors include saving the number to contacts, or sending the number to another device.

See RFC 3966 for syntax, additional features, and other details about the tel: URL scheme.Using the download attribute to save a <canvas> as a PNGTo save a <canvas> element's contents as an image, you can create a link where the href is the canvas data as a data: URL created with JavaScript and the download attribute provides the file name for the downloaded PNG file:

AttributesThis element only supports the global attributes. The title attribute has a specific semantic meaning when used with the <abbr> element; it must contain a full human-readable description or expansion of the abbreviation. This text is often presented by browsers as a tooltip when the mouse cursor is hovered over the element.
Each <abbr> element you use is independent of all others; providing a title for one does not automatically attach the same expansion text to others with the same content text.Usage notesTypical use casesIt's certainly not required that all abbreviations be marked up using <abbr>. There are, though, a few cases where it's helpful to do so:

When an abbreviation is used and you want to provide an expansion or definition outside the flow of the document's content, use <abbr> with an appropriate title.
To define an abbreviation which may be unfamiliar to the reader, present the term using <abbr> and inline text providing the definition. Include a title attribute only when the inline expansion or definition is not available.
When an abbreviation's presence in the text needs to be semantically noted, the <abbr> element is useful. This can be used, in turn, for styling or scripting purposes.
You can use <abbr> in concert with <dfn> to establish definitions for terms which are abbreviations or acronyms. See the example Defining an abbreviation below.
Grammar considerationsIn languages with grammatical number (that is, languages where the number of items affects the grammar of a sentence), use the same grammatical number in your title attribute as inside your <abbr> element. This is especially important in languages with more than two numbers, such as Arabic, but is also relevant in English.Default stylingThe purpose of this element is purely for the convenience of the author and all browsers display it inline (display: inline) by default, though its default styling varies from one browser to another:
Some browsers add a dotted underline to the content of the element. Others add a dotted underline while converting the contents to small caps. Others may not style it differently than a <span> element. To control this styling, use text-decoration and font-variant.AccessibilitySpelling out the acronym or abbreviation in full the first time it is used on a page is beneficial for helping people understand it, especially if the content is technical or industry jargon.
Only include a title if expanding the abbreviation or acronym in the text is not possible. Having a difference between the announced word or phrase and what is displayed on the screen, especially if it's technical jargon the reader may not be familiar with, can be jarring.

This is especially helpful for people who are unfamiliar with the terminology or concepts discussed in the content, people who are new to the language, and people with cognitive concerns.ExamplesMarking up an abbreviation semanticallyTo mark up an abbreviation without providing an expansion or description, use <abbr> without any attributes, as seen in this example.

Each <abbr> element you use is independent of all others; providing a title for one does not automatically attach the same expansion text to others with the same content text.Usage notesTypical use casesIt's certainly not required that all abbreviations be marked up using <abbr>. There are, though, a few cases where it's helpful to do so:

When an abbreviation is used and you want to provide an expansion or definition outside the flow of the document's content, use <abbr> with an appropriate title.
To define an abbreviation which may be unfamiliar to the reader, present the term using <abbr> and inline text providing the definition. Include a title attribute only when the inline expansion or definition is not available.
When an abbreviation's presence in the text needs to be semantically noted, the <abbr> element is useful. This can be used, in turn, for styling or scripting purposes.
You can use <abbr> in concert with <dfn> to establish definitions for terms which are abbreviations or acronyms. See the example Defining an abbreviation below.
Grammar considerationsIn languages with grammatical number (that is, languages where the number of items affects the grammar of a sentence), use the same grammatical number in your title attribute as inside your <abbr> element. This is especially important in languages with more than two numbers, such as Arabic, but is also relevant in English.Default stylingThe purpose of this element is purely for the convenience of the author and all browsers display it inline (display: inline) by default, though its default styling varies from one browser to another:
Some browsers add a dotted underline to the content of the element. Others add a dotted underline while converting the contents to small caps. Others may not style it differently than a <span> element. To control this styling, use text-decoration and font-variant.AccessibilitySpelling out the acronym or abbreviation in full the first time it is used on a page is beneficial for helping people understand it, especially if the content is technical or industry jargon.
Only include a title if expanding the abbreviation or acronym in the text is not possible. Having a difference between the announced word or phrase and what is displayed on the screen, especially if it's technical jargon the reader may not be familiar with, can be jarring.

When including an abbreviation or acronym, provide a full expansion of the term in plain text on first use, along with the <abbr> to mark up the abbreviation. This informs the user what the abbreviation or acronym means.
The optional title attribute can provide an expansion for the abbreviation or acronym when a full expansion is not present. This provides a hint to user agents on how to announce/display the content while informing all users what the abbreviation means. If present, title must contain this full description and nothing else.Try it

AttributesThis element's attributes include the global attributes.

alt

A text string alternative to display on browsers that do not display images.
The text should be phrased so that it presents the user with the same kind of choice as the image would offer when displayed without the alternative text.
This attribute is required only if the href attribute is used.

coords

The coords attribute details the coordinates of the shape attribute in size, shape, and placement of an <area>.
This attribute must not be used if shape is set to default.

rect: the value is x1,y1,x2,y2.
The value specifies the coordinates of the top-left and bottom-right corner of the rectangle.
For example, in <area shape="rect" coords="0,0,253,27" href="#" target="_blank" alt="Mozilla"> the coordinates are 0,0 and 253,27, indicating the top-left and bottom-right corners of the rectangle, respectively.
circle: the value is x,y,radius. Value specifies the coordinates of the circle center and the radius.
For example: <area shape="circle" coords="130,136,60" href="#" target="_blank" alt="MDN">
poly: the value is x1,y1,x2,y2,..,xn,yn. Value specifies the coordinates of the edges of the polygon.
If the first and last coordinate pairs are not the same, the browser will add the last coordinate pair to close the polygon

The values are numbers of CSS pixels.

download

This attribute, if present, indicates that the linked resource is intended to be downloaded rather than displayed in the browser.
See <a> for a full description of the download attribute.

href

The hyperlink target for the area.
Its value is a valid URL.
This attribute may be omitted; if so, the <area> element does not represent a hyperlink.

ping

Contains a space-separated list of URLs to which, when the hyperlink is followed, POST requests with the body PING will be sent by the browser (in the background).
Typically used for tracking.

referrerpolicy

A string indicating which referrer to use when fetching the resource:

no-referrer: The Referer header will not be sent.
no-referrer-when-downgrade: The Referer header will not be sent to origins without TLS (HTTPS).
origin: The sent referrer will be limited to the origin of the referring page: its scheme, host, and port.
origin-when-cross-origin: The referrer sent to other origins will be limited to the scheme, the host, and the port. Navigations on the same origin will still include the path.
same-origin: A referrer will be sent for same origin, but cross-origin requests will contain no referrer information.
strict-origin: Only send the origin of the document as the referrer when the protocol security level stays the same (HTTPS→HTTPS), but don't send it to a less secure destination (HTTPS→HTTP).
strict-origin-when-cross-origin (default): Send a full URL when performing a same-origin request, only send the origin when the protocol security level stays the same (HTTPS→HTTPS), and send no header to a less secure destination (HTTPS→HTTP).
unsafe-url: The referrer will include the origin and the path (but not the fragment, password, or username).
This value is unsafe, because it leaks origins and paths from TLS-protected resources to insecure origins.


rel

For anchors containing the href attribute, this attribute specifies the relationship of the target object to the link object.
The value is a space-separated list of link types.
The values and their semantics will be registered by some authority that might have meaning to the document author.
The default relationship, if no other is given, is void. Use this attribute only if the href attribute is present.

shape

The shape of the associated hot spot. The specifications for HTML defines the values rect, which defines a rectangular region; circle, which defines a circular region; poly, which defines a polygon; and default, which indicates the entire region beyond any defined shapes.

target

A keyword or author-defined name of the browsing context to display the linked resource.
The following keywords have special meanings:

_self (default): Show the resource in the current browsing context.
_blank: Show the resource in a new, unnamed browsing context.
_parent: Show the resource in the parent browsing context of the current one, if the current page is inside a frame.
If there is no parent, acts the same as _self.
_top: Show the resource in the topmost browsing context (the browsing context that is an ancestor of the current one and has no parent).
If there is no parent, acts the same as _self.

Use this attribute only if the href attribute is present.

Note:
Setting target="_blank" on <area> elements implicitly provides the same rel behavior as setting rel="noopener" which does not set window.opener. See browser compatibility for support status.

A given document can have multiple articles in it; for example, on a blog that shows the text of each article one after another as the reader scrolls, each post would be contained in an <article> element, possibly with one or more <section>s within.AttributesThis element only includes the global attributes.Usage notes
Each <article> should be identified, typically by including a heading (<h1> - <h6> element) as a child of the <article> element.
When an <article> element is nested, the inner element represents an article related to the outer element. For example, the comments of a blog post can be <article> elements nested in the <article> representing the blog post.
Author information of an <article> element can be provided through the <address> element, but it doesn't apply to nested <article> elements.
The publication date and time of an <article> element can be described using the datetime attribute of a <time> element.

A given document can have multiple articles in it; for example, on a blog that shows the text of each article one after another as the reader scrolls, each post would be contained in an <article> element, possibly with one or more <section>s within.AttributesThis element only includes the global attributes.Usage notes
Each <article> should be identified, typically by including a heading (<h1> - <h6> element) as a child of the <article> element.
When an <article> element is nested, the inner element represents an article related to the outer element. For example, the comments of a blog post can be <article> elements nested in the <article> representing the blog post.
Author information of an <article> element can be provided through the <address> element, but it doesn't apply to nested <article> elements.
The publication date and time of an <article> element can be described using the datetime attribute of a <time> element.
