### 1. Overview
GitHub Actions automates build, test, and deployment workflows via YAML files placed in `.github/workflows`. It supports events such as push, pull request, release, and manual triggers.

### 2. Workflow Configuration
Define workflows using YAML with mandatory keys:
- `name`: Name of the workflow.
- `on`: Trigger events (array or object format).
- `jobs`: Collection of jobs configured to run on specified runners.

### 3. Events & Triggers
Example: `on: [push]` triggers workflow on push events. Further configuration can include branch filters:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
```

### 4. Jobs, Dependencies, and Sequential Execution
Jobs are independent unless dependencies are specified using `needs`:

```yaml
jobs:
  job1:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Job 1"
  job2:
    needs: job1
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Job 2 after job1"
```

### 5. Actions Usage
Actions are reusable components. Example to checkout repository:

```yaml
- name: Check out repository code
  uses: actions/checkout@v4
```

### 6. Runners Specifications
Use `runs-on` to specify required runners such as `ubuntu-latest`, `windows-latest`, or custom labels:

```yaml
runs-on: [self-hosted, linux, x64]
```

### 7. Advanced Features
#### Matrix Strategy
Run jobs across different versions/environments:

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    node: [14, 16]
```

#### Caching Dependencies
Cache dependencies to speed up workflows:

```yaml
- name: Cache node modules
  uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: ~/.npm
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-build-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
```

#### Secrets and Environment Variables
Inject secrets into workflows securely:

```yaml
- name: Retrieve secret
  env:
    my_secret: ${{ secrets.MY_SECRET }}
  run: echo $my_secret
```

#### Service Containers
Run ephemeral containers for services (e.g., PostgreSQL):

```yaml
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres
```

### 8. Workflow Templates & Reusability
Preconfigured templates can be used from the GitHub Marketplace or the starter-workflows repository to speed up setup.

### 9. Troubleshooting and Best Practices
- Ensure workflow files are placed under `.github/workflows`.
- Validate YAML syntax using linters.
- Use `needs` to control job sequence.
- Avoid recursive triggers by configuring token usage appropriately.
- Check logs in GitHub Actions UI for detailed step outputs.

## Supplementary Details
### Supplementary Technical Specifications

1. **Workflow File Requirements:**
   - File path: `.github/workflows/<filename>.yml`
   - Must include at least one event trigger via the `on` key.

2. **Configuration Options:**
   - `runs-on`: Specifies runner type. Defaults like `ubuntu-latest` are provided.
   - `strategy.matrix`: Defines parameter arrays for multiple job runs. E.g., node versions: `[14, 16]`.
   - `needs`: Specifies job dependencies; if not defined, jobs run in parallel.
   - Secrets: Referenced as `${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}`, must be defined in repository settings.
   - Environment variables: Configured in the `env` block and accessible via shell.

3. **Implementation Steps for Creating a Workflow:**
   a. Create a new YAML file in `.github/workflows`.
   b. Define the `on` key for triggers (e.g. `push`).
   c. Define `jobs` and specify their `runs-on` and `steps`.
   d. Use the `actions/checkout` action to pull repository code.
   e. Implement additional steps like file listing (`ls ${{ github.workspace }}`) and echo commands.
   f. Commit the workflow to trigger its execution.

4. **Best Practices:**
   - Organize workflows by function (CI, deployment, testing).
   - Separate secrets from code by storing them in repository secrets.
   - Use matrix strategies to test multiple environments.
   - Utilize caching to reduce redundant downloads and installations.
   - Monitor job logs for output and investigate failing steps using detailed log commands.

5. **Troubleshooting Procedures:**
   - Check GitHub Actions run logs for step outputs and errors.
   - Validate YAML syntax using online parsers or local linters.
   - If jobs fail due to token authentication, switch from GITHUB_TOKEN to a Personal Access Token or GitHub App token as needed.
   - Use `echo` debugging: insert commands like `echo "Variable: ${{ variable }}"` in steps.
   - If caching fails, verify the cache key format and existence of target directories.

## Overview
GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform enabling automation of build, test, and deployment pipelines. Workflows are defined in YAML files stored in the `.github/workflows` directory and can be triggered by events (push, pull request, schedule, repository_dispatch, etc.).

## Workflows
- **Definition:** YAML files specifying one or more jobs.
- **Key Elements:**
  - `on`: Event triggers (e.g., push, fork, schedule, manual)
  - `jobs`: Group of tasks to execute.
  - **Example Workflow File:**

```yaml
name: GitHub Actions Demo
run-name: "${{ github.actor }} is testing out GitHub Actions üöÄ"
on: [push]
jobs:
  Explore-GitHub-Actions:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "üéâ The job was automatically triggered by a ${{ github.event_name }} event."
      - run: echo "üêß This job is now running on a ${{ runner.os }} server hosted by GitHub!"
      - run: echo "üîé Branch: ${{ github.ref }}, Repository: ${{ github.repository }}."
      - name: Check out repository code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: echo "üí° Repository cloned to runner."
      - name: List files in the repository
        run: |
          ls ${{ github.workspace }}
      - run: echo "üçè Job status is ${{ job.status }}."
```

## Events & Triggers
- **Triggers:** `push`, `fork`, `issue`, `schedule`, etc.
- **Event Properties:** Each event passes contextual information (e.g., `github.event_name`, `github.ref`).

## Jobs and Steps
- **Job Definition:** A collection of steps executed on a runner.
- **Dependencies:** Use `needs` to define job order.

**Example:**

```yaml
jobs:
  setup:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: ./setup_server.sh
  build:
    needs: setup
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: ./build_server.sh
  test:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: ./test_server.sh
```

## Actions
- **Definition:** Reusable extensions; can be custom or marketplace provided.
- **Usage Example:**

```yaml
- name: Check out repository code
  uses: actions/checkout@v4
```

## Runners
- **Types:** GitHub-hosted (Ubuntu, Windows, macOS) and self-hosted.
- **Configuration:** Specify using `runs-on` key. E.g., `runs-on: [self-hosted, linux, x64, gpu]` 

## Advanced Workflow Features
### Matrix Strategy
- **Purpose:** Execute job variations concurrently using variable combinations.

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node: [14, 16]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node }}
```

### Caching Dependencies
- **Example using npm cache:**

```yaml
- name: Cache node modules
  uses: actions/cache@v4
  env:
    cache-name: cache-node-modules
  with:
    path: ~/.npm
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-build-${{ env.cache-name }}-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-build-${{ env.cache-name }}-
```

### Secrets and Environment Variables
- **Setting Secret:** Use repository secrets and reference them as `${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}`.
- **Example:**

```yaml
- name: Retrieve secret
  env:
    super_secret: ${{ secrets.SUPERSECRET }}
  run: |
    echo "The secret is $super_secret"
```

### Service Containers
- **Usage:** Run ephemeral containers to provide services (e.g., PostgreSQL) for jobs.

```yaml
jobs:
  container-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container: node:20-bookworm-slim
    services:
      postgres:
        image: postgres
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: npm ci
      - run: node client.js
        env:
          POSTGRES_HOST: postgres
          POSTGRES_PORT: 5432
```

## Workflow Templates
- **Usage:** Preconfigured YAML templates based on project language/framework.
- **Location:** [`actions/starter-workflows`](https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows)

## Troubleshooting and Best Practices
- **Configuration Validation:** Ensure YAML files are in `.github/workflows`.
- **Environment Variables:** Test variable outputs using echo commands.
- **Job Dependencies:** Use `needs` to control execution flow and avoid parallel job conflicts.
- **Recursive Trigger Prevention:** Use correct token (avoid using GITHUB_TOKEN for triggering events to prevent loops).
