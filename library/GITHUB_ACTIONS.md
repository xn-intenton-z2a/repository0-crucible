### 1. Workflows
- **Definition:** Automated processes defined in YAML files.
- **Location:** `.github/workflows`
- **Key Elements:** `name`, `on`, `jobs`
- **Example Workflow:**
```yaml
name: GitHub Actions Demo
on: [push]
jobs:
  Explore-GitHub-Actions:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Triggered by ${{ github.event_name }} event."
      - name: Check out repository code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
```

### 2. Events
- **Definition:** Events that trigger workflow runs.
- **Examples:** `push`, `pull_request`, `fork`, `issues`, `schedule`
- **Event Filtering:** Use filters under event keys.
- **Example:**
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
```

### 3. Jobs
- **Definition:** A set of steps executed on a specified runner.
- **Parameters:** `runs-on`, `needs`
- **Example:**
```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Building application..."
```

### 4. Actions
- **Definition:** Reusable code units for performing specific tasks.
- **Usage Example:**
```yaml
- name: Checkout code
  uses: actions/checkout@v4
```

### 5. Runners
- **Definition:** Servers or VMs that execute jobs.
- **Types:** GitHub-hosted (e.g., `ubuntu-latest`), Self-hosted
- **Configuration Example:**
```yaml
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```

### 6. Workflow Templates
- **Definition:** Prebuilt YAML templates to kickstart workflows.
- **Usage:** Access through GitHub UI and customize as necessary.

### 7. Advanced Features
- **Matrix Builds:** Run jobs with multiple variable values:
```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    node: [14, 16]
```
- **Caching:** Improve speed by caching dependencies:
```yaml
- uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: ~/.npm
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
```
- **Service Containers:** Deploy ephemeral containers:
```yaml
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres
```


## Supplementary Details
### Technical Specifications and Implementation Details

1. **Workflow File Requirements**:
   - Must reside in `.github/workflows`.
   - File extension: `.yml` or `.yaml`.

2. **Event Triggers**:
   - Syntax: `on: [event1, event2]` or detailed YAML mapping for filtering events.
   - Example with branch filter:
     ```yaml
     on:
       push:
         branches: [ main ]
     ```

3. **Job Dependencies**:
   - Jobs run in parallel unless specified using the `needs` keyword.
   - Example:
     ```yaml
     jobs:
       build:
         runs-on: ubuntu-latest
         steps:
           - run: ./build.sh
       test:
         needs: build
         runs-on: ubuntu-latest
         steps:
           - run: ./test.sh
     ```

4. **Matrix Strategy**:
   - Define a matrix under strategy to run jobs with different parameters.
   - Example:
     ```yaml
     strategy:
       matrix:
         node: [14, 16]
     ```

5. **Caching**:
   - Use `actions/cache@v4` to cache directories like `~/.npm`.
   - Key generation often uses environment variables and file hashes:
     ```yaml
     - uses: actions/cache@v4
       with:
         path: ~/.npm
         key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
     ```

6. **Service Containers**:
   - Define containers under the `services` key to run databases or caches alongside your job.
   - Example:
     ```yaml
     services:
       postgres:
         image: postgres
     ```

7. **Secrets and Environment Variables**:
   - Secrets are referenced as `${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}` and passed to jobs via `env`.
   - Example:
     ```yaml
     env:
       MY_SECRET: ${{ secrets.MY_SECRET }}
     ```

8. **Best Practices**:
   - Store sensitive data in GitHub Secrets.
   - Use matrix builds to test across different environments.
   - Cache dependencies to speed up workflow execution.
   - Limit job scope by breaking down workflows into dependent jobs with the `needs` keyword.

9. **Troubleshooting Procedures**:
   - Check run logs via the GitHub Actions UI.
   - Expand individual steps to view detailed logs.
   - For caching issues, verify the cache key and restore keys are correctly configured.
   - Use the `echo` command in steps to output environment variables for debugging.
   - Example debugging step:
     ```yaml
     - run: echo "Current branch: ${{ github.ref }}"
     ```

## Overview
GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform that automates build, test, and deployment pipelines directly in your GitHub repository. Workflows are defined as YAML files stored in the `.github/workflows` directory and are triggered by events like push, pull_request, schedule, or manually via workflow_dispatch.

## Workflow Structure
A workflow file consists of: 
- **Event triggers**: defined using the `on:` key.
- **Jobs**: a collection of steps that run on a specified runner.
- **Steps**: individual scripts or actions executed sequentially within a job.

### Example Workflow YAML
```yaml
name: GitHub Actions Demo
run-name: ${{ github.actor }} is testing out GitHub Actions üöÄ
on: [push]
jobs:
  Explore-GitHub-Actions:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "üéâ The job was automatically triggered by a ${{ github.event_name }} event."
      - run: echo "üêß This job is now running on a ${{ runner.os }} server hosted by GitHub!"
      - run: echo "üîé The name of your branch is ${{ github.ref }} and your repository is ${{ github.repository }}."
      - name: Check out repository code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: echo "üí° The ${{ github.repository }} repository has been cloned to the runner."
      - run: echo "üñ•Ô∏è The workflow is now ready to test your code on the runner."
      - name: List files in the repository
        run: |
          ls ${{ github.workspace }}
      - run: echo "üçè This job's status is ${{ job.status }}."
```
