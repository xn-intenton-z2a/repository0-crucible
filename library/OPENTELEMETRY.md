# Detailed Digest

This document provides a concise digest of the OpenTelemetry documentation, emphasizing its role in observational data collection and distributed tracing. The source outlines core concepts such as context propagation, metrics, and logs, forming the backbone of modern observability in distributed systems. Critical assessment reveals that while the material is thorough and extensive, its presentation is primarily technical and assumes familiarity with instrumentation principles. The material’s authority is bolstered by its official status, although critical evaluation suggests that additional contextual examples might enhance understanding for newcomers.

The structure is efficient for technical audiences but could benefit from more practical use-case scenarios. The clear categorization of topics (e.g., fundamentals, instrumentation, semantic conventions) supports its reliability. 

# Glossary

- **Observability:** The measure of how well internal states of a system can be inferred from knowledge of its external outputs.
- **Instrumentation:** The process of adding monitoring capabilities to software systems.
