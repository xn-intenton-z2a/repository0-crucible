1. Introduction
   - OWL 2 language defined for Semantic Web.
   - Provides formal definitions for classes, properties, individuals, data values in Semantic Web documents.
2. Overview
   - Details on OWL 2 structure including its dual syntactic representations: RDF/XML as primary and alternative syntaxes (Turtle, OWL/XML, Manchester, Functional).
   - Precise specification: OWL 2 Structural Specification defines ontology structure using UML; Mapping to RDF Graphs defines conversion rules between structural and RDF graph forms.
3. Ontologies
   - Complete conceptual structure per OWL 2 Structural Specification.
   - Functional-style syntax defined to match the structural specification.
   - RDF graph mapping specifics provided in Mapping to RDF Graphs document.
4. Syntaxes
   - RDF/XML: Mandatory, with complete interoperability legacy. Exact reference: [RDF/XML, Mapping to RDF Graphs].
   - OWL/XML: Optional XML serialization for compatibility with XML tools.
   - Functional Syntax: Mirrors Structural Specification. 
   - Manchester Syntax: Optional syntax for readability in DL ontologies.
   - Turtle: Optional RDF serialization; noted as not from OWL Working Group.
   - Tabulated specifications include names, related documents, status, and usage purpose.
5. Semantics
   - Direct Semantics: Model-theoretic approach based on SROIQ with required conditions (e.g., no transitive properties in number restrictions).
   - RDF-Based Semantics: Extends RDF Semantics, applicable to all OWL 2 ontologies, with a correspondence theorem ensuring consistency with Direct Semantics.
6. Profiles
   - OWL 2 EL: For polynomial reasoning in large ontologies.
   - OWL 2 QL: Supports conjunctive queries via relational database technology (AC0, LogSpace).
   - OWL 2 RL: Enables rule-based implementations for RDF triple stores; complete ground atomic query reasoning under suitable conditions.
7. Relationship to OWL 1

8. Documentation Roadmap
   - Lists core specification documents: Structural Specification, Mapping to RDF Graphs, Direct Semantics, RDF-Based Semantics, Conformance; along with user guides such as Primer, New Features and Rationale, Quick Reference Guide, XML Serialization, Manchester Syntax, Data Range Extension.

## Supplementary Details
Technical Specifications and Implementation Details:
- Syntax Specifications:
  * RDF/XML is mandatory for all OWL 2 tools. Document reference: [OWL 2 Conformance].
  * OWL/XML (Optional): XML Serialization used for XML tools.
  * Functional Syntax: Direct mapping from OWL 2 Structural Specification.
  * Manchester Syntax: Improved readability, referenced in [OWL 2 Manchester Syntax].
  * Turtle: Optional, used with Mapping to RDF Graphs.

- Semantic Specifications:
  * Direct Semantics: Based on SROIQ; restrictions include conditions such as disallowing transitive properties in numeric restrictions. Return type of semantic evaluation is a model-theoretic interpretation.
  * RDF-Based Semantics: Mapped directly from RDF graphs; fully compatible with RDF Semantics.
  * Correspondence theorem in Section 7.2 of RDF-Based Semantics ensures that inferences under Direct Semantics are valid when converted to RDF graph form.

- Profiles:
  * OWL 2 EL: Optimized for large ontologies with polynomial time reasoning.
  * OWL 2 QL: Designed for efficient query answering using AC0/LogSpace complexity, ideal for relational DB integration.
  * OWL 2 RL: Employs rule-based reasoning; implementation pattern includes processing RDF triples directly with guaranteed soundness (completeness subject to restrictions).

- Documentation Roadmap:
  * Core documents: Structural Specification, Mapping to RDF Graphs, Direct Semantics, RDF-Based Semantics, Conformance.
  * User guides: OWL 2 Primer, New Features and Rationale, Quick Reference Guide.

- Configuration Options:
  * Document URLs, publication dates, and version numbers are fixed as per W3C Recommendation (11 December 2012).
  * Non-normative formats available include PDF and color-coded diff formats.

- Implementation Steps:
  1. Define ontology structure using OWL 2 Structural Specification guidelines.
  2. Serialize ontology into RDF/XML for mandatory support.
  3. Optionally, convert to Manchester or Functional Syntax for readability or structural clarity.
  4. Apply Direct Semantics for DL reasoning, or RDF-Based Semantics for general RDF graph processing.

- Best Practices:
  * Always use RDF/XML as the baseline for interoperability.
  * Verify ontology compliance with OWL 2 DL restrictions if using Direct Semantics.
  * Utilize the corresponding profile (EL, QL, or RL) based on application demands.

- Troubleshooting Procedures:
  * Command: Validate ontology using W3C OWL 2 Conformance tests (e.g., run a command-line validator which outputs detailed error logs).
  * Check for usage of transitive properties in number restrictions if errors arise in Direct Semantics.
  * Verify all document URLs and version numbers to ensure consistency with the 2012 recommendations.
  * Use provided test cases in the Conformance document to compare expected results.
