## Supplementary Details
Technical Specifications:
- OWL 2 Structural Specification: Defines ontology structure via UML diagrams and a functional-style syntax for compact representation. Includes conditions for OWL 2 DL (e.g., no transitive properties in number restrictions).
- Syntax Configurations:
    * RDF/XML: Mandatory; endpoint URL: http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-owl2-overview-20121211/.
    * OWL/XML: Optional; used for XML-based processing.
    * Functional Syntax: Optional; mirrors structural specification for clarity.
    * Manchester Syntax: Optional; human-readable with editor support.
    * Turtle: Optional; lightweight form for RDF triple serialization.
- Semantics Details:
    * Direct Semantics: Maps ontology elements to SROIQ; method enforces syntactic conditions for validity.
    * RDF-Based Semantics: Applies mapping rules to convert ontology into RDF graphs; supports OWL 2 Full and adheres to extended RDF semantic conditions.
- Profiles Implementation:
    * EL, QL, RL are defined as subsets of the structural elements with explicit restrictions; profile selection is based on performance needs and reasoning capabilities.
- Implementation Steps:
    1. Choose a concrete syntax (e.g. RDF/XML) based on tool support.
    2. Validate ontology against Structural Specification conditions for OWL 2 DL if using Direct Semantics.
    3. For rule-based reasoning, apply OWL 2 RL profile with specified mapping to RDF triples.
    4. Verify semantic consistency using both Direct and RDF-Based Semantics via correspondence theorem.
- Configuration Options:
    * Syntax selection: { format: 'RDF/XML' | 'OWL/XML' | 'Functional' | 'Manchester' | 'Turtle' }.
    * Semantics mode: { mode: 'Direct' (for DL) | 'RDF-Based' (for full ontologies) }.
- Best Practices:
    * Use RDF/XML as the common interchange format.
    * Validate ontology consistency with both semantic interpretations.
    * Employ Manchester Syntax for manual editing and review.
    * Select the appropriate profile (EL, QL, RL) based on application domain and performance requirements.
- Troubleshooting Procedures:
    * Command for validating RDF/XML: use OWL API validator with command line: "owlapi-validator --input ontology.owl --format RDF/XML"; expected output: valid if no syntax errors.
    * For semantic errors in OWL 2 DL: check conditions outlined in Section 3 of the Structural Specification; use detailed logs to identify clause violations (e.g. transitivity in number restrictions).
    * Use correspondence theorem checks to compare inference results between Direct and RDF-Based Semantics.

## Reference Details
API Specifications and Implementation Patterns:
- No explicit SDK methods in the document; however, the following patterns apply:

Pattern for Ontology Creation:
Method: createOntology(String ontologyIRI) -> Ontology
Parameters: ontologyIRI: String (e.g. 'http://example.org/myOntology')
Return Type: Ontology object with methods for adding classes, properties, individuals.

Pattern for Adding Classes:
Method: addClass(Ontology ontology, String classIRI) -> void
Parameters: ontology: Ontology object
            classIRI: String
Example Implementation:
// Create an ontology
Ontology ontology = createOntology('http://example.org/myOntology');
// Add a class
addClass(ontology, 'http://example.org/myOntology#Person');

Configuration Options in OWL Tools (e.g., OWL API configuration):
Property: syntaxFormat, Values: 'RDF/XML' (default), 'OWL/XML', 'Functional', 'Manchester', 'Turtle'
Property: semanticsMode, Values: 'Direct', 'RDF-Based'
Effect: Determines the parsing, validation, and reasoning strategy.

Best Practices:
- Always validate ontology against the OWL 2 Structural Specification conditions before reasoning.
- Use RDF/XML format for exchange between systems.
- For manual editing, convert to Manchester Syntax for readability.
- When using rule-based reasoning (OWL 2 RL), ensure the rule engine applies the complete set of inference rules as defined in the Profiles document.

Troubleshooting Steps:
1. Validate file using command: owlapi-validator --input ontology.owl --format RDF/XML
2. If errors occur, check the log for specific clause references (e.g., Section 3 of Structural Specification) and adjust transitive properties in cardinality restrictions.
3. Compare inference results between Direct and RDF-Based Semantics by running: owl-inference-checker --ontology ontology.owl --mode Direct
4. If discrepancies are found, consult the correspondence theorem details in the RDF-Based Semantics document.

Return Types and Exceptions:
- createOntology: returns Ontology; throws OntologyCreationException if invalid IRI.
- addClass: returns void; throws InvalidOntologyException if ontology fails structural checks.

These detailed specifications and patterns are directly extracted from the OWL 2 Overview documentation and provide a concrete implementation blueprint for developers using OWL 2 in Semantic Web environments.

## Overview
This document is the W3C Recommendation for the OWL 2 Web Ontology Language (Second Edition) published on 11 December 2012. It details the formal structure, syntaxes, semantics, profiles, and change history of OWL 2 for Semantic Web applications.

## 1. Introduction
OWL 2 is an ontology language for the Semantic Web with formally defined meaning. It provides constructs for classes, properties, individuals, and data types. The language is designed to be used in RDF documents with explicit mappings to RDF graphs.

## 2. Ontologies
- Defined in the OWL 2 Structural Specification.
- Conceptual structure is represented by UML diagrams.
- Two views: abstract structure and RDF graph representation (Mapping to RDF Graphs document).
- Functional-style syntax option matches the structural specification exactly.

## 3. Syntaxes
Supported syntaxes include:

Name: RDF/XML
Specification: Mapping to RDF Graphs, RDF/XML
Status: Mandatory
Purpose: Interchange format; must be supported by all conformant tools.

Name: OWL/XML
Specification: XML Serialization
Status: Optional
Purpose: Easier processing with XML tools.

Name: Functional Syntax
Specification: Structural Specification
Status: Optional
Purpose: Clearly shows the formal structure of ontologies.

Name: Manchester Syntax
Specification: Manchester Syntax
Status: Optional
Purpose: Human readable; commonly used in ontology editors.

Name: Turtle
Specification: Mapping to RDF Graphs, Turtle
Status: Optional, Not from OWL-WG
Purpose: Read/write RDF triples in a concise form.

## 4. Semantics
Two semantic approaches are provided:

Direct Semantics:
- Assigns meaning directly to ontology structures.
- Compatible with SROIQ description logic.
- OWL 2 DL ontologies satisfy syntactic conditions (e.g., restrictions on transitive properties in number restrictions).

RDF-Based Semantics:
- Assigns meaning by mapping OWL 2 ontologies to RDF graphs.
- Fully compatible with RDF Semantics.
- Allows interpretation of any OWL 2 ontology without restrictions (OWL 2 Full).

A correspondence theorem links Direct and RDF-Based Semantics ensuring consistency between inference results.

## 5. Profiles
OWL 2 defines three sub-languages:

OWL 2 EL:
- Enables polynomial time reasoning for large ontologies.

OWL 2 QL:
- Enables conjunctive query answering in LogSpace/AC0 via relational database technology.

OWL 2 RL:
- Supports rule-based reasoning directly on RDF triples; guarantees soundness and often completeness for ground atomic queries (Theorem PR1).

## 6. Relationship to OWL 1
- Overall structure similar to OWL 1 with largely equivalent building blocks.
- Backwards compatibility: All OWL 1 ontologies are valid OWL 2 ontologies with identical practical inferences.
- New features include richer datatype support, qualified cardinality restrictions, and additional property characteristics (asymmetry, reflexivity, disjointness, etc.).

## 7. Documentation Roadmap
Core specifications include:
1. Document Overview - introductory guide.
2. Structural Specification and Functional-Style Syntax - defines constructs and global restrictions.
3. Mapping to RDF Graphs - defines the RDF serialization for OWL 2.
4. Direct Semantics - model theoretic semantics for OWL 2.
5. RDF-Based Semantics - extension of RDF semantics for OWL 2.
6. Conformance - requirements for compliance and testing.
7. Profiles - detailed restrictions for OWL 2 EL, QL, RL.
8. Supplementary user documents such as the OWL 2 Primer, New Features and Rationale, and Quick Reference Guide.

## 8. Change Log
Detailed log with three sections:
- Changes Since Recommendation
- Changes Since Proposed Recommendation
- Changes Since Last Call
Includes specific dates (e.g., Recommendation of 27 October 2009, changes following XSD 1.1 adoption on 5 April 2012) and minor editorial adjustments.
