1.  Introduction

   This specification defines JSON Pointer, a string syntax for
   identifying a specific value within a JavaScript Object Notation
   (JSON) document [RFC4627].  JSON Pointer is intended to be easily
   expressed in JSON string values as well as Uniform Resource
   Identifier (URI) [RFC3986] fragment identifiers.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This specification expresses normative syntax rules using Augmented
   Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234] notation.

3.  Syntax

   A JSON Pointer is a Unicode string (see [RFC4627], Section 3)
   containing a sequence of zero or more reference tokens, each prefixed
   by a '/' (%x2F) character.

   Because the characters '~' (%x7E) and '/' (%x2F) have special
   meanings in JSON Pointer, '~' needs to be encoded as '~0' and '/'
   needs to be encoded as '~1' when these characters appear in a
   reference token.









Bryan, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 2]

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   The ABNF syntax of a JSON Pointer is:

      json-pointer    = *( "/" reference-token )
      reference-token = *( unescaped / escaped )
      unescaped       = %x00-2E / %x30-7D / %x7F-10FFFF
         ; %x2F ('/') and %x7E ('~') are excluded from 'unescaped'
      escaped         = "~" ( "0" / "1" )
        ; representing '~' and '/', respectively

   It is an error condition if a JSON Pointer value does not conform to
   this syntax (see Section 7).

   Note that JSON Pointers are specified in characters, not as bytes.

4.  Evaluation

   Evaluation of a JSON Pointer begins with a reference to the root
   value of a JSON document and completes with a reference to some value
   within the document.  Each reference token in the JSON Pointer is
   evaluated sequentially.

   Evaluation of each reference token begins by decoding any escaped
   character sequence.  This is performed by first transforming any
   occurrence of the sequence '~1' to '/', and then transforming any
   occurrence of the sequence '~0' to '~'.  By performing the
   substitutions in this order, an implementation avoids the error of
   turning '~01' first into '~1' and then into '/', which would be
   incorrect (the string '~01' correctly becomes '~1' after
   transformation).

   The reference token then modifies which value is referenced according
   to the following scheme:

   o  If the currently referenced value is a JSON object, the new
      referenced value is the object member with the name identified by
      the reference token.  The member name is equal to the token if it
      has the same number of Unicode characters as the token and their
      code points are byte-by-byte equal.  No Unicode character
      normalization is performed.  If a referenced member name is not
      unique in an object, the member that is referenced is undefined,
      and evaluation fails (see below).










Bryan, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 3]

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   o  If the currently referenced value is a JSON array, the reference
      token MUST contain either:

      *  characters comprised of digits (see ABNF below; note that
         leading zeros are not allowed) that represent an unsigned
         base-10 integer value, making the new referenced value the
         array element with the zero-based index identified by the
         token, or

      *  exactly the single character "-", making the new referenced
         value the (nonexistent) member after the last array element.

   The ABNF syntax for array indices is:

   array-index = %x30 / ( %x31-39 *(%x30-39) )
                 ; "0", or digits without a leading "0"

   Implementations will evaluate each reference token against the
   document's contents and will raise an error condition if it fails to
   resolve a concrete value for any of the JSON pointer's reference
   tokens.  For example, if an array is referenced with a non-numeric
   token, an error condition will be raised.  See Section 7 for details.

   Note that the use of the "-" character to index an array will always
   result in such an error condition because by definition it refers to
   a nonexistent array element.  Thus, applications of JSON Pointer need
   to specify how that character is to be handled, if it is to be
   useful.

   Any error condition for which a specific action is not defined by the
   JSON Pointer application results in termination of evaluation.

5.  JSON String Representation

   A JSON Pointer can be represented in a JSON string value.  Per
   [RFC4627], Section 2.5, all instances of quotation mark '"' (%x22),
   reverse solidus '\' (%x5C), and control (%x00-1F) characters MUST be
   escaped.

   Note that before processing a JSON string as a JSON Pointer,
   backslash escape sequences must be unescaped.










Bryan, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 4]

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   For example, given the JSON document

   {
      "foo": ["bar", "baz"],
      "": 0,
      "a/b": 1,
      "c%d": 2,
      "e^f": 3,
      "g|h": 4,
      "i\\j": 5,
      "k\"l": 6,
      " ": 7,
      "m~n": 8
   }

   The following JSON strings evaluate to the accompanying values:

    ""           // the whole document
    "/foo"       ["bar", "baz"]
    "/foo/0"     "bar"
    "/"          0
    "/a~1b"      1
    "/c%d"       2
    "/e^f"       3
    "/g|h"       4
    "/i\\j"      5
    "/k\"l"      6
    "/ "         7
    "/m~0n"      8

6.  URI Fragment Identifier Representation

   A JSON Pointer can be represented in a URI fragment identifier by
   encoding it into octets using UTF-8 [RFC3629], while percent-encoding
   those characters not allowed by the fragment rule in [RFC3986].

   Note that a given media type needs to specify JSON Pointer as its
   fragment identifier syntax explicitly (usually, in its registration
   [RFC6838]).  That is, just because a document is JSON does not imply
   that JSON Pointer can be used as its fragment identifier syntax.  In
   particular, the fragment identifier syntax for application/json is
   not JSON Pointer.









Bryan, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 5]

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   Given the same example document as above, the following URI fragment
   identifiers evaluate to the accompanying values:

    #            // the whole document
    #/foo        ["bar", "baz"]
    #/foo/0      "bar"
    #/           0
    #/a~1b       1
    #/c%25d      2
    #/e%5Ef      3
    #/g%7Ch      4
    #/i%5Cj      5
    #/k%22l      6
    #/%20        7
    #/m~0n       8

7.  Error Handling

   In the event of an error condition, evaluation of the JSON Pointer
   fails to complete.

   Error conditions include, but are not limited to:

   o  Invalid pointer syntax

   o  A pointer that references a nonexistent value

   This specification does not define how errors are handled.  An
   application of JSON Pointer SHOULD specify the impact and handling of
   each type of error.

   For example, some applications might stop pointer processing upon an
   error, while others may attempt to recover from missing values by
   inserting default ones.

8.  Security Considerations

   A given JSON Pointer is not guaranteed to reference an actual JSON
   value.  Therefore, applications using JSON Pointer should anticipate
   this situation by defining how a pointer that does not resolve ought
   to be handled.

   Note that JSON pointers can contain the NUL (Unicode U+0000)
   character.  Care is needed not to misinterpret this character in
   programming languages that use NUL to mark the end of a string.

Anyone can write and submit an Internet-Draft.\nSome I-Ds may eventually be published as a Request for Comment (RFC).  Each of the RFC Streams has their own process for how an I-D becomes an RFC.  For the IETF that is documented in the standards development process.  When an I-D is approved to become an RFC, it follows the separate RFC Editor RFC publication process.\nstandards development process\nRFC publication process\nUnless otherwise indicated, the information on this site applies to all streams.\nInternet-Drafts are prepared by people acting in possibly several roles, such as an author or an editor. The term "author" is used here, but the information applies to people acting in any role.\nTo find out more about authoring an I-D, begin with Getting started.\n¶ Contributing to this site\nThe content for this site is available in GitHub and we welcome pull requests proposing changes from the community. The repository README provides guidance on how to submit pull requests.\nLikewise, the templates and schemas available on this site are published on GitHub and we welcome pull requests proposing changes.\ntemplates and schemas\nThis site includes much text from previous work by Henrik Levkowetz, Robert Sparks, Russ Housley, Ben Kaduk, Murray Kucherawy, Alvaro Retana, the RFC Production Center, and the members of many Internet Engineering Steering Groups (IESGs).\nActivity on this site is tracked in accordance with the IETF/IRTF/IAB Privacy Statement\nIETF/IRTF/IAB Privacy Statement\n\n\nConcluded WG

            Final
            Charter for
            
            Working Group
        
        The Applications Area sometimes receives proposals for the development
  of specifications dealing with application-related topics that are not
  in scope for an existing working group and do not justify the formation
  of a new working group.
The Applications Area Working Group (APPSAWG) can serve as a forum for such
  work in the IETF. The APPSAWG accepts work items in accordance with the
  consensus of the Working Group and the best judgment of the Applications
  Area
  Directors, who are responsible for updating the working group milestones
  as needed. The working group meets if there are active proposals that
  require intensive discussion.
Work items that are appropriate for the APPSAWG mostly fall under the
  following topics:
(A) Well-defined security issues that are relevant to multiple
  application technologies (e.g., draft-saintandre-tls-server-id-check).
(B) Small-scale additions to the protocol stack for HTTP and other
  application technologies, mostly related to service discovery and
  meta-data (e.g., RFC 5785, draft-nottingham-http-link-header, and
  draft-hammer-hostmeta).
(C) Selected other work items addressing topics that historically fall
  within the Applications Area, such as calendaring, date and time
  formats, HTTP, internationalization, language tags, MIME, URIs and XML.
When considering whether to accept a proposed work item, the APPSAWG and
  the Applications Area Directors shall take into account the following
  factors, among others:


There is no existing related Working Group that is willing to recharter
  to take on this work, and the document doesn't justify the formation
  of a new working group.


Whether the WG has consensus on the suitability, importance, and
  projected quality of the proposed work item.


Whether there is a core team of WG participants with sufficient energy
  and expertise to advance the proposed work item according to the proposed
  schedule.


Whether there are enough WG participants who are willing to review
  the work produced by the document authors or editors.


Whether the Area Directors judge that wider input is needed before
  accepting the proposed work item (e.g., from the IESG, IAB, or another
  standards development organization).

            Final
            Charter for
            
            Working Group
        
        The Applications Area sometimes receives proposals for the development
  of specifications dealing with application-related topics that are not
  in scope for an existing working group and do not justify the formation
  of a new working group.
The Applications Area Working Group (APPSAWG) can serve as a forum for such
  work in the IETF. The APPSAWG accepts work items in accordance with the
  consensus of the Working Group and the best judgment of the Applications
  Area
  Directors, who are responsible for updating the working group milestones
  as needed. The working group meets if there are active proposals that
  require intensive discussion.
Work items that are appropriate for the APPSAWG mostly fall under the
  following topics:
(A) Well-defined security issues that are relevant to multiple
  application technologies (e.g., draft-saintandre-tls-server-id-check).
(B) Small-scale additions to the protocol stack for HTTP and other
  application technologies, mostly related to service discovery and
  meta-data (e.g., RFC 5785, draft-nottingham-http-link-header, and
  draft-hammer-hostmeta).
(C) Selected other work items addressing topics that historically fall
  within the Applications Area, such as calendaring, date and time
  formats, HTTP, internationalization, language tags, MIME, URIs and XML.
When considering whether to accept a proposed work item, the APPSAWG and
  the Applications Area Directors shall take into account the following
  factors, among others:


There is no existing related Working Group that is willing to recharter
  to take on this work, and the document doesn't justify the formation
  of a new working group.


Whether the WG has consensus on the suitability, importance, and
  projected quality of the proposed work item.


Whether there is a core team of WG participants with sufficient energy
  and expertise to advance the proposed work item according to the proposed
  schedule.


Whether there are enough WG participants who are willing to review
  the work produced by the document authors or editors.


Whether the Area Directors judge that wider input is needed before
  accepting the proposed work item (e.g., from the IESG, IAB, or another
  standards development organization).

            Final
            Charter for
            
            Working Group
        
        The Applications Area sometimes receives proposals for the development
  of specifications dealing with application-related topics that are not
  in scope for an existing working group and do not justify the formation
  of a new working group.
The Applications Area Working Group (APPSAWG) can serve as a forum for such
  work in the IETF. The APPSAWG accepts work items in accordance with the
  consensus of the Working Group and the best judgment of the Applications
  Area
  Directors, who are responsible for updating the working group milestones
  as needed. The working group meets if there are active proposals that
  require intensive discussion.
Work items that are appropriate for the APPSAWG mostly fall under the
  following topics:
(A) Well-defined security issues that are relevant to multiple
  application technologies (e.g., draft-saintandre-tls-server-id-check).
(B) Small-scale additions to the protocol stack for HTTP and other
  application technologies, mostly related to service discovery and
  meta-data (e.g., RFC 5785, draft-nottingham-http-link-header, and
  draft-hammer-hostmeta).
(C) Selected other work items addressing topics that historically fall
  within the Applications Area, such as calendaring, date and time
  formats, HTTP, internationalization, language tags, MIME, URIs and XML.
When considering whether to accept a proposed work item, the APPSAWG and
  the Applications Area Directors shall take into account the following
  factors, among others:


There is no existing related Working Group that is willing to recharter
  to take on this work, and the document doesn't justify the formation
  of a new working group.


Whether the WG has consensus on the suitability, importance, and
  projected quality of the proposed work item.


Whether there is a core team of WG participants with sufficient energy
  and expertise to advance the proposed work item according to the proposed
  schedule.


Whether there are enough WG participants who are willing to review
  the work produced by the document authors or editors.


Whether the Area Directors judge that wider input is needed before
  accepting the proposed work item (e.g., from the IESG, IAB, or another
  standards development organization).

This site is the central resource site for authors of an Internet-Draft (I-D), with information on how to write an I-D and the tools available to support this. If you are new to authoring then begin with the introduction below or if you are more familiar then the main menu lists multiple individual topics.

If you have been redirected here from tools.ietf.org then that site has been decommissioned.  The features available at that site have been replaced as follows:
- The interactive tools are now at https://author-tools.ietf.org
- The catalog of tools is now at Tools catalog
- The xml2rfc vocabulary documentation is now at RFCXML Vocabulary
- The repositories for the various tools are now in the ietf-tools organisation on GitHub

¶ Introducing Internet-Drafts
Internet-Drafts (I-Ds) are the basic work items of the IETF and they are produced for a variety of purposes by a wide range of individuals and groups. Anyone can write and submit an Internet-Draft.
Some I-Ds may eventually be published as a Request for Comment (RFC).  Each of the RFC Streams has their own process for how an I-D becomes an RFC.  For the IETF that is documented in the standards development process.  When an I-D is approved to become an RFC, it follows the separate RFC Editor RFC publication process.
Unless otherwise indicated, the information on this site applies to all streams.
Internet-Drafts are prepared by people acting in possibly several roles, such as an author or an editor. The term "author" is used here, but the information applies to people acting in any role.
To find out more about authoring an I-D, begin with Getting started.

Internet-Drafts (I-Ds) are the basic work items of the IETF and they are produced for a variety of purposes by a wide range of individuals and groups. Anyone can write and submit an Internet-Draft.
Some I-Ds may eventually be published as a Request for Comment (RFC).  Each of the RFC Streams has their own process for how an I-D becomes an RFC.  For the IETF that is documented in the standards development process.  When an I-D is approved to become an RFC, it follows the separate RFC Editor RFC publication process.
Unless otherwise indicated, the information on this site applies to all streams.
Internet-Drafts are prepared by people acting in possibly several roles, such as an author or an editor. The term "author" is used here, but the information applies to people acting in any role.
To find out more about authoring an I-D, begin with Getting started.

This site is the central resource site for authors of an Internet-Draft (I-D), with information on how to write an I-D and the tools available to support this. If you are new to authoring then begin with the introduction below or if you are more familiar then the main menu lists multiple individual topics.

If you have been redirected here from tools.ietf.org then that site has been decommissioned.  The features available at that site have been replaced as follows:
- The interactive tools are now at https://author-tools.ietf.org
- The catalog of tools is now at Tools catalog
- The xml2rfc vocabulary documentation is now at RFCXML Vocabulary
- The repositories for the various tools are now in the ietf-tools organisation on GitHub

¶ Introducing Internet-Drafts
Internet-Drafts (I-Ds) are the basic work items of the IETF and they are produced for a variety of purposes by a wide range of individuals and groups. Anyone can write and submit an Internet-Draft.
Some I-Ds may eventually be published as a Request for Comment (RFC).  Each of the RFC Streams has their own process for how an I-D becomes an RFC.  For the IETF that is documented in the standards development process.  When an I-D is approved to become an RFC, it follows the separate RFC Editor RFC publication process.
Unless otherwise indicated, the information on this site applies to all streams.
Internet-Drafts are prepared by people acting in possibly several roles, such as an author or an editor. The term "author" is used here, but the information applies to people acting in any role.
To find out more about authoring an I-D, begin with Getting started.

1.  Introduction

   This specification defines JSON Pointer, a string syntax for
   identifying a specific value within a JavaScript Object Notation
   (JSON) document [RFC4627].  JSON Pointer is intended to be easily
   expressed in JSON string values as well as Uniform Resource
   Identifier (URI) [RFC3986] fragment identifiers.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This specification expresses normative syntax rules using Augmented
   Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234] notation.

3.  Syntax

   A JSON Pointer is a Unicode string (see [RFC4627], Section 3)
   containing a sequence of zero or more reference tokens, each prefixed
   by a '/' (%x2F) character.

   Because the characters '~' (%x7E) and '/' (%x2F) have special
   meanings in JSON Pointer, '~' needs to be encoded as '~0' and '/'
   needs to be encoded as '~1' when these characters appear in a
   reference token.









Bryan, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 2]

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   The ABNF syntax of a JSON Pointer is:

      json-pointer    = *( "/" reference-token )
      reference-token = *( unescaped / escaped )
      unescaped       = %x00-2E / %x30-7D / %x7F-10FFFF
         ; %x2F ('/') and %x7E ('~') are excluded from 'unescaped'
      escaped         = "~" ( "0" / "1" )
        ; representing '~' and '/', respectively

   It is an error condition if a JSON Pointer value does not conform to
   this syntax (see Section 7).

   Note that JSON Pointers are specified in characters, not as bytes.

4.  Evaluation

   Evaluation of a JSON Pointer begins with a reference to the root
   value of a JSON document and completes with a reference to some value
   within the document.  Each reference token in the JSON Pointer is
   evaluated sequentially.

   Evaluation of each reference token begins by decoding any escaped
   character sequence.  This is performed by first transforming any
   occurrence of the sequence '~1' to '/', and then transforming any
   occurrence of the sequence '~0' to '~'.  By performing the
   substitutions in this order, an implementation avoids the error of
   turning '~01' first into '~1' and then into '/', which would be
   incorrect (the string '~01' correctly becomes '~1' after
   transformation).

   The reference token then modifies which value is referenced according
   to the following scheme:

   o  If the currently referenced value is a JSON object, the new
      referenced value is the object member with the name identified by
      the reference token.  The member name is equal to the token if it
      has the same number of Unicode characters as the token and their
      code points are byte-by-byte equal.  No Unicode character
      normalization is performed.  If a referenced member name is not
      unique in an object, the member that is referenced is undefined,
      and evaluation fails (see below).










Bryan, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 3]

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   o  If the currently referenced value is a JSON array, the reference
      token MUST contain either:

      *  characters comprised of digits (see ABNF below; note that
         leading zeros are not allowed) that represent an unsigned
         base-10 integer value, making the new referenced value the
         array element with the zero-based index identified by the
         token, or

      *  exactly the single character "-", making the new referenced
         value the (nonexistent) member after the last array element.

   The ABNF syntax for array indices is:

   array-index = %x30 / ( %x31-39 *(%x30-39) )
                 ; "0", or digits without a leading "0"

   Implementations will evaluate each reference token against the
   document's contents and will raise an error condition if it fails to
   resolve a concrete value for any of the JSON pointer's reference
   tokens.  For example, if an array is referenced with a non-numeric
   token, an error condition will be raised.  See Section 7 for details.

   Note that the use of the "-" character to index an array will always
   result in such an error condition because by definition it refers to
   a nonexistent array element.  Thus, applications of JSON Pointer need
   to specify how that character is to be handled, if it is to be
   useful.

   Any error condition for which a specific action is not defined by the
   JSON Pointer application results in termination of evaluation.

5.  JSON String Representation

   A JSON Pointer can be represented in a JSON string value.  Per
   [RFC4627], Section 2.5, all instances of quotation mark '"' (%x22),
   reverse solidus '\' (%x5C), and control (%x00-1F) characters MUST be
   escaped.

   Note that before processing a JSON string as a JSON Pointer,
   backslash escape sequences must be unescaped.










Bryan, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 4]

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   For example, given the JSON document

   {
      "foo": ["bar", "baz"],
      "": 0,
      "a/b": 1,
      "c%d": 2,
      "e^f": 3,
      "g|h": 4,
      "i\\j": 5,
      "k\"l": 6,
      " ": 7,
      "m~n": 8
   }

   The following JSON strings evaluate to the accompanying values:

    ""           // the whole document
    "/foo"       ["bar", "baz"]
    "/foo/0"     "bar"
    "/"          0
    "/a~1b"      1
    "/c%d"       2
    "/e^f"       3
    "/g|h"       4
    "/i\\j"      5
    "/k\"l"      6
    "/ "         7
    "/m~0n"      8

6.  URI Fragment Identifier Representation

   A JSON Pointer can be represented in a URI fragment identifier by
   encoding it into octets using UTF-8 [RFC3629], while percent-encoding
   those characters not allowed by the fragment rule in [RFC3986].

   Note that a given media type needs to specify JSON Pointer as its
   fragment identifier syntax explicitly (usually, in its registration
   [RFC6838]).  That is, just because a document is JSON does not imply
   that JSON Pointer can be used as its fragment identifier syntax.  In
   particular, the fragment identifier syntax for application/json is
   not JSON Pointer.









Bryan, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 5]

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   Given the same example document as above, the following URI fragment
   identifiers evaluate to the accompanying values:

    #            // the whole document
    #/foo        ["bar", "baz"]
    #/foo/0      "bar"
    #/           0
    #/a~1b       1
    #/c%25d      2
    #/e%5Ef      3
    #/g%7Ch      4
    #/i%5Cj      5
    #/k%22l      6
    #/%20        7
    #/m~0n       8

7.  Error Handling

   In the event of an error condition, evaluation of the JSON Pointer
   fails to complete.

   Error conditions include, but are not limited to:

   o  Invalid pointer syntax

   o  A pointer that references a nonexistent value

   This specification does not define how errors are handled.  An
   application of JSON Pointer SHOULD specify the impact and handling of
   each type of error.

   For example, some applications might stop pointer processing upon an
   error, while others may attempt to recover from missing values by
   inserting default ones.

8.  Security Considerations

   A given JSON Pointer is not guaranteed to reference an actual JSON
   value.  Therefore, applications using JSON Pointer should anticipate
   this situation by defining how a pointer that does not resolve ought
   to be handled.

   Note that JSON pointers can contain the NUL (Unicode U+0000)
   character.  Care is needed not to misinterpret this character in
   programming languages that use NUL to mark the end of a string.

   Because the characters '~' (%x7E) and '/' (%x2F) have special

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   The ABNF syntax of a JSON Pointer is:

      json-pointer    = *( "/" reference-token )
      reference-token = *( unescaped / escaped )
      unescaped       = %x00-2E / %x30-7D / %x7F-10FFFF
         ; %x2F ('/') and %x7E ('~') are excluded from 'unescaped'
      escaped         = "~" ( "0" / "1" )
        ; representing '~' and '/', respectively

   It is an error condition if a JSON Pointer value does not conform to
   this syntax (see Section 7).

   Note that JSON Pointers are specified in characters, not as bytes.

4.  Evaluation

   Evaluation of a JSON Pointer begins with a reference to the root
   value of a JSON document and completes with a reference to some value
   within the document.  Each reference token in the JSON Pointer is
   evaluated sequentially.

   Evaluation of each reference token begins by decoding any escaped
   character sequence.  This is performed by first transforming any
   occurrence of the sequence '~1' to '/', and then transforming any
   occurrence of the sequence '~0' to '~'.  By performing the
   substitutions in this order, an implementation avoids the error of
   turning '~01' first into '~1' and then into '/', which would be
   incorrect (the string '~01' correctly becomes '~1' after
   transformation).

   The reference token then modifies which value is referenced according
   to the following scheme:

   o  If the currently referenced value is a JSON object, the new
      referenced value is the object member with the name identified by
      the reference token.  The member name is equal to the token if it
      has the same number of Unicode characters as the token and their
      code points are byte-by-byte equal.  No Unicode character
      normalization is performed.  If a referenced member name is not
      unique in an object, the member that is referenced is undefined,
      and evaluation fails (see below).

   o  If the currently referenced value is a JSON array, the reference
      token MUST contain either:

      *  characters comprised of digits (see ABNF below; note that
         leading zeros are not allowed) that represent an unsigned

         token, or

      *  exactly the single character "-", making the new referenced
         value the (nonexistent) member after the last array element.

   The ABNF syntax for array indices is:

   array-index = %x30 / ( %x31-39 *(%x30-39) )
                 ; "0", or digits without a leading "0"

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   For example, given the JSON document

   {
      "foo": ["bar", "baz"],
      "": 0,
      "a/b": 1,
      "c%d": 2,
      "e^f": 3,
      "g|h": 4,
      "i\\j": 5,
      "k\"l": 6,
      " ": 7,
      "m~n": 8
   }

   The following JSON strings evaluate to the accompanying values:

    ""           // the whole document
    "/foo"       ["bar", "baz"]
    "/foo/0"     "bar"
    "/"          0
    "/a~1b"      1
    "/c%d"       2
    "/e^f"       3
    "/g|h"       4
    "/i\\j"      5
    "/k\"l"      6
    "/ "         7
    "/m~0n"      8

6.  URI Fragment Identifier Representation

   A JSON Pointer can be represented in a URI fragment identifier by
   encoding it into octets using UTF-8 [RFC3629], while percent-encoding
   those characters not allowed by the fragment rule in [RFC3986].

   Note that a given media type needs to specify JSON Pointer as its
   fragment identifier syntax explicitly (usually, in its registration
   [RFC6838]).  That is, just because a document is JSON does not imply
   that JSON Pointer can be used as its fragment identifier syntax.  In
   particular, the fragment identifier syntax for application/json is
   not JSON Pointer.









Bryan, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 5]

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   Given the same example document as above, the following URI fragment
   identifiers evaluate to the accompanying values:

    #            // the whole document
    #/foo        ["bar", "baz"]
    #/foo/0      "bar"
    #/           0
    #/a~1b       1
    #/c%25d      2
    #/e%5Ef      3
    #/g%7Ch      4
    #/i%5Cj      5
    #/k%22l      6
    #/%20        7
    #/m~0n       8

7.  Error Handling

   In the event of an error condition, evaluation of the JSON Pointer
   fails to complete.

   Error conditions include, but are not limited to:

   o  Invalid pointer syntax

   o  A pointer that references a nonexistent value

   This specification does not define how errors are handled.  An
   application of JSON Pointer SHOULD specify the impact and handling of
   each type of error.

   For example, some applications might stop pointer processing upon an
   error, while others may attempt to recover from missing values by
   inserting default ones.

8.  Security Considerations

   A given JSON Pointer is not guaranteed to reference an actual JSON
   value.  Therefore, applications using JSON Pointer should anticipate
   this situation by defining how a pointer that does not resolve ought
   to be handled.

   Note that JSON pointers can contain the NUL (Unicode U+0000)
   character.  Care is needed not to misinterpret this character in
   programming languages that use NUL to mark the end of a string.

1.  Introduction

   This specification defines JSON Pointer, a string syntax for
   identifying a specific value within a JavaScript Object Notation
   (JSON) document [RFC4627].  JSON Pointer is intended to be easily
   expressed in JSON string values as well as Uniform Resource
   Identifier (URI) [RFC3986] fragment identifiers.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This specification expresses normative syntax rules using Augmented
   Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234] notation.

3.  Syntax

   A JSON Pointer is a Unicode string (see [RFC4627], Section 3)
   containing a sequence of zero or more reference tokens, each prefixed
   by a '/' (%x2F) character.

   Because the characters '~' (%x7E) and '/' (%x2F) have special
   meanings in JSON Pointer, '~' needs to be encoded as '~0' and '/'
   needs to be encoded as '~1' when these characters appear in a
   reference token.









Bryan, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 2]

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   The ABNF syntax of a JSON Pointer is:

      json-pointer    = *( "/" reference-token )
      reference-token = *( unescaped / escaped )
      unescaped       = %x00-2E / %x30-7D / %x7F-10FFFF
         ; %x2F ('/') and %x7E ('~') are excluded from 'unescaped'
      escaped         = "~" ( "0" / "1" )
        ; representing '~' and '/', respectively

   It is an error condition if a JSON Pointer value does not conform to
   this syntax (see Section 7).

   Note that JSON Pointers are specified in characters, not as bytes.

4.  Evaluation

   Evaluation of a JSON Pointer begins with a reference to the root
   value of a JSON document and completes with a reference to some value
   within the document.  Each reference token in the JSON Pointer is
   evaluated sequentially.

   Evaluation of each reference token begins by decoding any escaped
   character sequence.  This is performed by first transforming any
   occurrence of the sequence '~1' to '/', and then transforming any
   occurrence of the sequence '~0' to '~'.  By performing the
   substitutions in this order, an implementation avoids the error of
   turning '~01' first into '~1' and then into '/', which would be
   incorrect (the string '~01' correctly becomes '~1' after
   transformation).

   The reference token then modifies which value is referenced according
   to the following scheme:

   o  If the currently referenced value is a JSON object, the new
      referenced value is the object member with the name identified by
      the reference token.  The member name is equal to the token if it
      has the same number of Unicode characters as the token and their
      code points are byte-by-byte equal.  No Unicode character
      normalization is performed.  If a referenced member name is not
      unique in an object, the member that is referenced is undefined,
      and evaluation fails (see below).










Bryan, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 3]

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   o  If the currently referenced value is a JSON array, the reference
      token MUST contain either:

      *  characters comprised of digits (see ABNF below; note that
         leading zeros are not allowed) that represent an unsigned
         base-10 integer value, making the new referenced value the
         array element with the zero-based index identified by the
         token, or

      *  exactly the single character "-", making the new referenced
         value the (nonexistent) member after the last array element.

   The ABNF syntax for array indices is:

   array-index = %x30 / ( %x31-39 *(%x30-39) )
                 ; "0", or digits without a leading "0"

   Implementations will evaluate each reference token against the
   document's contents and will raise an error condition if it fails to
   resolve a concrete value for any of the JSON pointer's reference
   tokens.  For example, if an array is referenced with a non-numeric
   token, an error condition will be raised.  See Section 7 for details.

   Note that the use of the "-" character to index an array will always
   result in such an error condition because by definition it refers to
   a nonexistent array element.  Thus, applications of JSON Pointer need
   to specify how that character is to be handled, if it is to be
   useful.

   Any error condition for which a specific action is not defined by the
   JSON Pointer application results in termination of evaluation.

5.  JSON String Representation

   A JSON Pointer can be represented in a JSON string value.  Per
   [RFC4627], Section 2.5, all instances of quotation mark '"' (%x22),
   reverse solidus '\' (%x5C), and control (%x00-1F) characters MUST be
   escaped.

   Note that before processing a JSON string as a JSON Pointer,
   backslash escape sequences must be unescaped.










Bryan, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 4]

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   For example, given the JSON document

   {
      "foo": ["bar", "baz"],
      "": 0,
      "a/b": 1,
      "c%d": 2,
      "e^f": 3,
      "g|h": 4,
      "i\\j": 5,
      "k\"l": 6,
      " ": 7,
      "m~n": 8
   }

   The following JSON strings evaluate to the accompanying values:

    ""           // the whole document
    "/foo"       ["bar", "baz"]
    "/foo/0"     "bar"
    "/"          0
    "/a~1b"      1
    "/c%d"       2
    "/e^f"       3
    "/g|h"       4
    "/i\\j"      5
    "/k\"l"      6
    "/ "         7
    "/m~0n"      8

6.  URI Fragment Identifier Representation

   A JSON Pointer can be represented in a URI fragment identifier by
   encoding it into octets using UTF-8 [RFC3629], while percent-encoding
   those characters not allowed by the fragment rule in [RFC3986].

   Note that a given media type needs to specify JSON Pointer as its
   fragment identifier syntax explicitly (usually, in its registration
   [RFC6838]).  That is, just because a document is JSON does not imply
   that JSON Pointer can be used as its fragment identifier syntax.  In
   particular, the fragment identifier syntax for application/json is
   not JSON Pointer.

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   Given the same example document as above, the following URI fragment
   identifiers evaluate to the accompanying values:

    #            // the whole document
    #/foo        ["bar", "baz"]
    #/foo/0      "bar"
    #/           0
    #/a~1b       1
    #/c%25d      2
    #/e%5Ef      3
    #/g%7Ch      4
    #/i%5Cj      5
    #/k%22l      6
    #/%20        7

1.  Introduction

   This specification defines JSON Pointer, a string syntax for
   identifying a specific value within a JavaScript Object Notation
   (JSON) document [RFC4627].  JSON Pointer is intended to be easily
   expressed in JSON string values as well as Uniform Resource
   Identifier (URI) [RFC3986] fragment identifiers.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This specification expresses normative syntax rules using Augmented
   Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234] notation.

3.  Syntax

   A JSON Pointer is a Unicode string (see [RFC4627], Section 3)
   containing a sequence of zero or more reference tokens, each prefixed
   by a '/' (%x2F) character.

   Because the characters '~' (%x7E) and '/' (%x2F) have special
   meanings in JSON Pointer, '~' needs to be encoded as '~0' and '/'
   needs to be encoded as '~1' when these characters appear in a
   reference token.









Bryan, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 2]

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   The ABNF syntax of a JSON Pointer is:

      json-pointer    = *( "/" reference-token )
      reference-token = *( unescaped / escaped )
      unescaped       = %x00-2E / %x30-7D / %x7F-10FFFF
         ; %x2F ('/') and %x7E ('~') are excluded from 'unescaped'
      escaped         = "~" ( "0" / "1" )
        ; representing '~' and '/', respectively

   It is an error condition if a JSON Pointer value does not conform to
   this syntax (see Section 7).

   Note that JSON Pointers are specified in characters, not as bytes.

4.  Evaluation

   Evaluation of a JSON Pointer begins with a reference to the root
   value of a JSON document and completes with a reference to some value
   within the document.  Each reference token in the JSON Pointer is
   evaluated sequentially.

   Evaluation of each reference token begins by decoding any escaped
   character sequence.  This is performed by first transforming any
   occurrence of the sequence '~1' to '/', and then transforming any
   occurrence of the sequence '~0' to '~'.  By performing the
   substitutions in this order, an implementation avoids the error of
   turning '~01' first into '~1' and then into '/', which would be
   incorrect (the string '~01' correctly becomes '~1' after
   transformation).

   The reference token then modifies which value is referenced according
   to the following scheme:

   o  If the currently referenced value is a JSON object, the new
      referenced value is the object member with the name identified by
      the reference token.  The member name is equal to the token if it
      has the same number of Unicode characters as the token and their
      code points are byte-by-byte equal.  No Unicode character
      normalization is performed.  If a referenced member name is not
      unique in an object, the member that is referenced is undefined,
      and evaluation fails (see below).










Bryan, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 3]

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   o  If the currently referenced value is a JSON array, the reference
      token MUST contain either:

      *  characters comprised of digits (see ABNF below; note that
         leading zeros are not allowed) that represent an unsigned
         base-10 integer value, making the new referenced value the
         array element with the zero-based index identified by the
         token, or

      *  exactly the single character "-", making the new referenced
         value the (nonexistent) member after the last array element.

   The ABNF syntax for array indices is:

   array-index = %x30 / ( %x31-39 *(%x30-39) )
                 ; "0", or digits without a leading "0"

   Implementations will evaluate each reference token against the
   document's contents and will raise an error condition if it fails to
   resolve a concrete value for any of the JSON pointer's reference
   tokens.  For example, if an array is referenced with a non-numeric
   token, an error condition will be raised.  See Section 7 for details.

   Note that the use of the "-" character to index an array will always
   result in such an error condition because by definition it refers to
   a nonexistent array element.  Thus, applications of JSON Pointer need
   to specify how that character is to be handled, if it is to be
   useful.

   Any error condition for which a specific action is not defined by the
   JSON Pointer application results in termination of evaluation.

5.  JSON String Representation

   A JSON Pointer can be represented in a JSON string value.  Per
   [RFC4627], Section 2.5, all instances of quotation mark '"' (%x22),
   reverse solidus '\' (%x5C), and control (%x00-1F) characters MUST be
   escaped.

   Note that before processing a JSON string as a JSON Pointer,
   backslash escape sequences must be unescaped.










Bryan, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 4]

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   For example, given the JSON document

   {
      "foo": ["bar", "baz"],
      "": 0,
      "a/b": 1,
      "c%d": 2,
      "e^f": 3,
      "g|h": 4,
      "i\\j": 5,
      "k\"l": 6,
      " ": 7,
      "m~n": 8
   }

   The following JSON strings evaluate to the accompanying values:

    ""           // the whole document
    "/foo"       ["bar", "baz"]
    "/foo/0"     "bar"
    "/"          0
    "/a~1b"      1
    "/c%d"       2
    "/e^f"       3
    "/g|h"       4
    "/i\\j"      5
    "/k\"l"      6
    "/ "         7
    "/m~0n"      8

6.  URI Fragment Identifier Representation

   A JSON Pointer can be represented in a URI fragment identifier by
   encoding it into octets using UTF-8 [RFC3629], while percent-encoding
   those characters not allowed by the fragment rule in [RFC3986].

   Note that a given media type needs to specify JSON Pointer as its
   fragment identifier syntax explicitly (usually, in its registration
   [RFC6838]).  That is, just because a document is JSON does not imply
   that JSON Pointer can be used as its fragment identifier syntax.  In
   particular, the fragment identifier syntax for application/json is
   not JSON Pointer.









Bryan, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 5]

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   Given the same example document as above, the following URI fragment
   identifiers evaluate to the accompanying values:

    #            // the whole document
    #/foo        ["bar", "baz"]
    #/foo/0      "bar"
    #/           0
    #/a~1b       1
    #/c%25d      2
    #/e%5Ef      3
    #/g%7Ch      4
    #/i%5Cj      5
    #/k%22l      6
    #/%20        7
    #/m~0n       8

7.  Error Handling

   In the event of an error condition, evaluation of the JSON Pointer
   fails to complete.

   Error conditions include, but are not limited to:

   o  Invalid pointer syntax

   o  A pointer that references a nonexistent value

   This specification does not define how errors are handled.  An
   application of JSON Pointer SHOULD specify the impact and handling of
   each type of error.

   For example, some applications might stop pointer processing upon an
   error, while others may attempt to recover from missing values by
   inserting default ones.

8.  Security Considerations

   A given JSON Pointer is not guaranteed to reference an actual JSON
   value.  Therefore, applications using JSON Pointer should anticipate
   this situation by defining how a pointer that does not resolve ought
   to be handled.

   Note that JSON pointers can contain the NUL (Unicode U+0000)
   character.  Care is needed not to misinterpret this character in
   programming languages that use NUL to mark the end of a string.

1.  Introduction

   This specification defines JSON Pointer, a string syntax for
   identifying a specific value within a JavaScript Object Notation
   (JSON) document [RFC4627].  JSON Pointer is intended to be easily
   expressed in JSON string values as well as Uniform Resource

   This specification expresses normative syntax rules using Augmented
   Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234] notation.

3.  Syntax

   A JSON Pointer is a Unicode string (see [RFC4627], Section 3)
   containing a sequence of zero or more reference tokens, each prefixed
   by a '/' (%x2F) character.

   Because the characters '~' (%x7E) and '/' (%x2F) have special
   meanings in JSON Pointer, '~' needs to be encoded as '~0' and '/'
   needs to be encoded as '~1' when these characters appear in a
   reference token.

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   The ABNF syntax of a JSON Pointer is:

      json-pointer    = *( "/" reference-token )
      reference-token = *( unescaped / escaped )
      unescaped       = %x00-2E / %x30-7D / %x7F-10FFFF
         ; %x2F ('/') and %x7E ('~') are excluded from 'unescaped'
      escaped         = "~" ( "0" / "1" )
        ; representing '~' and '/', respectively

   It is an error condition if a JSON Pointer value does not conform to
   this syntax (see Section 7).

   Note that JSON Pointers are specified in characters, not as bytes.

4.  Evaluation

   Evaluation of a JSON Pointer begins with a reference to the root
   value of a JSON document and completes with a reference to some value
   within the document.  Each reference token in the JSON Pointer is
   evaluated sequentially.

   Evaluation of each reference token begins by decoding any escaped
   character sequence.  This is performed by first transforming any
   occurrence of the sequence '~1' to '/', and then transforming any
   occurrence of the sequence '~0' to '~'.  By performing the
   substitutions in this order, an implementation avoids the error of
   turning '~01' first into '~1' and then into '/', which would be
   incorrect (the string '~01' correctly becomes '~1' after
   transformation).

   The reference token then modifies which value is referenced according
   to the following scheme:

   o  If the currently referenced value is a JSON object, the new
      referenced value is the object member with the name identified by
      the reference token.  The member name is equal to the token if it
      has the same number of Unicode characters as the token and their
      code points are byte-by-byte equal.  No Unicode character
      normalization is performed.  If a referenced member name is not
      unique in an object, the member that is referenced is undefined,
      and evaluation fails (see below).

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   o  If the currently referenced value is a JSON array, the reference
      token MUST contain either:

      *  characters comprised of digits (see ABNF below; note that
         leading zeros are not allowed) that represent an unsigned
         base-10 integer value, making the new referenced value the
         array element with the zero-based index identified by the
         token, or

      *  exactly the single character "-", making the new referenced
         value the (nonexistent) member after the last array element.

   The ABNF syntax for array indices is:

   array-index = %x30 / ( %x31-39 *(%x30-39) )
                 ; "0", or digits without a leading "0"

   Implementations will evaluate each reference token against the
   document's contents and will raise an error condition if it fails to
   resolve a concrete value for any of the JSON pointer's reference
   tokens.  For example, if an array is referenced with a non-numeric
   token, an error condition will be raised.  See Section 7 for details.

   Note that the use of the "-" character to index an array will always

   For example, given the JSON document

   {
      "foo": ["bar", "baz"],

   those characters not allowed by the fragment rule in [RFC3986].

   Note that a given media type needs to specify JSON Pointer as its
   fragment identifier syntax explicitly (usually, in its registration
   [RFC6838]).  That is, just because a document is JSON does not imply
   that JSON Pointer can be used as its fragment identifier syntax.  In
   particular, the fragment identifier syntax for application/json is
   not JSON Pointer.

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   Given the same example document as above, the following URI fragment
   identifiers evaluate to the accompanying values:

    #            // the whole document
    #/foo        ["bar", "baz"]
    #/foo/0      "bar"
    #/           0
    #/a~1b       1
    #/c%25d      2
    #/e%5Ef      3
    #/g%7Ch      4
    #/i%5Cj      5
    #/k%22l      6
    #/%20        7
    #/m~0n       8

7.  Error Handling

   In the event of an error condition, evaluation of the JSON Pointer
   fails to complete.

   Error conditions include, but are not limited to:

   o  Invalid pointer syntax

   o  A pointer that references a nonexistent value

   This specification does not define how errors are handled.  An
   application of JSON Pointer SHOULD specify the impact and handling of
   each type of error.

   For example, some applications might stop pointer processing upon an
   error, while others may attempt to recover from missing values by
   inserting default ones.

8.  Security Considerations

   A given JSON Pointer is not guaranteed to reference an actual JSON
   value.  Therefore, applications using JSON Pointer should anticipate
   this situation by defining how a pointer that does not resolve ought
   to be handled.

   Note that JSON pointers can contain the NUL (Unicode U+0000)
   character.  Care is needed not to misinterpret this character in
   programming languages that use NUL to mark the end of a string.

1.  Introduction

   This specification defines JSON Pointer, a string syntax for
   identifying a specific value within a JavaScript Object Notation
   (JSON) document [RFC4627].  JSON Pointer is intended to be easily
   expressed in JSON string values as well as Uniform Resource
   Identifier (URI) [RFC3986] fragment identifiers.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This specification expresses normative syntax rules using Augmented
   Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234] notation.

3.  Syntax

   A JSON Pointer is a Unicode string (see [RFC4627], Section 3)
   containing a sequence of zero or more reference tokens, each prefixed
   by a '/' (%x2F) character.

   Because the characters '~' (%x7E) and '/' (%x2F) have special
   meanings in JSON Pointer, '~' needs to be encoded as '~0' and '/'
   needs to be encoded as '~1' when these characters appear in a
   reference token.









Bryan, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 2]

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   The ABNF syntax of a JSON Pointer is:

      json-pointer    = *( "/" reference-token )
      reference-token = *( unescaped / escaped )
      unescaped       = %x00-2E / %x30-7D / %x7F-10FFFF
         ; %x2F ('/') and %x7E ('~') are excluded from 'unescaped'
      escaped         = "~" ( "0" / "1" )
        ; representing '~' and '/', respectively

   It is an error condition if a JSON Pointer value does not conform to
   this syntax (see Section 7).

   Note that JSON Pointers are specified in characters, not as bytes.

4.  Evaluation

   Evaluation of a JSON Pointer begins with a reference to the root
   value of a JSON document and completes with a reference to some value
   within the document.  Each reference token in the JSON Pointer is
   evaluated sequentially.

   Evaluation of each reference token begins by decoding any escaped
   character sequence.  This is performed by first transforming any
   occurrence of the sequence '~1' to '/', and then transforming any
   occurrence of the sequence '~0' to '~'.  By performing the
   substitutions in this order, an implementation avoids the error of
   turning '~01' first into '~1' and then into '/', which would be
   incorrect (the string '~01' correctly becomes '~1' after
   transformation).

   The reference token then modifies which value is referenced according
   to the following scheme:

   o  If the currently referenced value is a JSON object, the new
      referenced value is the object member with the name identified by
      the reference token.  The member name is equal to the token if it
      has the same number of Unicode characters as the token and their
      code points are byte-by-byte equal.  No Unicode character
      normalization is performed.  If a referenced member name is not
      unique in an object, the member that is referenced is undefined,
      and evaluation fails (see below).










Bryan, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 3]

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   o  If the currently referenced value is a JSON array, the reference
      token MUST contain either:

      *  characters comprised of digits (see ABNF below; note that
         leading zeros are not allowed) that represent an unsigned
         base-10 integer value, making the new referenced value the
         array element with the zero-based index identified by the
         token, or

      *  exactly the single character "-", making the new referenced
         value the (nonexistent) member after the last array element.

   The ABNF syntax for array indices is:

   array-index = %x30 / ( %x31-39 *(%x30-39) )
                 ; "0", or digits without a leading "0"

   Implementations will evaluate each reference token against the
   document's contents and will raise an error condition if it fails to
   resolve a concrete value for any of the JSON pointer's reference
   tokens.  For example, if an array is referenced with a non-numeric
   token, an error condition will be raised.  See Section 7 for details.

   Note that the use of the "-" character to index an array will always
   result in such an error condition because by definition it refers to
   a nonexistent array element.  Thus, applications of JSON Pointer need
   to specify how that character is to be handled, if it is to be
   useful.

   Any error condition for which a specific action is not defined by the
   JSON Pointer application results in termination of evaluation.

5.  JSON String Representation

   A JSON Pointer can be represented in a JSON string value.  Per
   [RFC4627], Section 2.5, all instances of quotation mark '"' (%x22),
   reverse solidus '\' (%x5C), and control (%x00-1F) characters MUST be
   escaped.

   Note that before processing a JSON string as a JSON Pointer,
   backslash escape sequences must be unescaped.










Bryan, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 4]

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   For example, given the JSON document

   {
      "foo": ["bar", "baz"],
      "": 0,
      "a/b": 1,
      "c%d": 2,
      "e^f": 3,
      "g|h": 4,
      "i\\j": 5,
      "k\"l": 6,
      " ": 7,
      "m~n": 8
   }

   The following JSON strings evaluate to the accompanying values:

    ""           // the whole document
    "/foo"       ["bar", "baz"]
    "/foo/0"     "bar"
    "/"          0
    "/a~1b"      1
    "/c%d"       2
    "/e^f"       3
    "/g|h"       4
    "/i\\j"      5
    "/k\"l"      6
    "/ "         7
    "/m~0n"      8

6.  URI Fragment Identifier Representation

   A JSON Pointer can be represented in a URI fragment identifier by
   encoding it into octets using UTF-8 [RFC3629], while percent-encoding
   those characters not allowed by the fragment rule in [RFC3986].

   Note that a given media type needs to specify JSON Pointer as its
   fragment identifier syntax explicitly (usually, in its registration
   [RFC6838]).  That is, just because a document is JSON does not imply
   that JSON Pointer can be used as its fragment identifier syntax.  In
   particular, the fragment identifier syntax for application/json is
   not JSON Pointer.









Bryan, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 5]

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   Given the same example document as above, the following URI fragment
   identifiers evaluate to the accompanying values:

    #            // the whole document
    #/foo        ["bar", "baz"]
    #/foo/0      "bar"
    #/           0
    #/a~1b       1
    #/c%25d      2
    #/e%5Ef      3
    #/g%7Ch      4
    #/i%5Cj      5
    #/k%22l      6
    #/%20        7
    #/m~0n       8

   fails to complete.

1.  Introduction

   This specification defines JSON Pointer, a string syntax for
   identifying a specific value within a JavaScript Object Notation
   (JSON) document [RFC4627].  JSON Pointer is intended to be easily
   expressed in JSON string values as well as Uniform Resource
   Identifier (URI) [RFC3986] fragment identifiers.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This specification expresses normative syntax rules using Augmented
   Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234] notation.

3.  Syntax

   A JSON Pointer is a Unicode string (see [RFC4627], Section 3)
   containing a sequence of zero or more reference tokens, each prefixed
   by a '/' (%x2F) character.

   Because the characters '~' (%x7E) and '/' (%x2F) have special
   meanings in JSON Pointer, '~' needs to be encoded as '~0' and '/'
   needs to be encoded as '~1' when these characters appear in a
   reference token.









Bryan, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 2]

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   The ABNF syntax of a JSON Pointer is:

      json-pointer    = *( "/" reference-token )
      reference-token = *( unescaped / escaped )
      unescaped       = %x00-2E / %x30-7D / %x7F-10FFFF
         ; %x2F ('/') and %x7E ('~') are excluded from 'unescaped'
      escaped         = "~" ( "0" / "1" )
        ; representing '~' and '/', respectively

   It is an error condition if a JSON Pointer value does not conform to
   this syntax (see Section 7).

   Note that JSON Pointers are specified in characters, not as bytes.

4.  Evaluation

   Evaluation of a JSON Pointer begins with a reference to the root
   value of a JSON document and completes with a reference to some value
   within the document.  Each reference token in the JSON Pointer is
   evaluated sequentially.

   Evaluation of each reference token begins by decoding any escaped
   character sequence.  This is performed by first transforming any
   occurrence of the sequence '~1' to '/', and then transforming any
   occurrence of the sequence '~0' to '~'.  By performing the
   substitutions in this order, an implementation avoids the error of
   turning '~01' first into '~1' and then into '/', which would be
   incorrect (the string '~01' correctly becomes '~1' after
   transformation).

   The reference token then modifies which value is referenced according
   to the following scheme:

   o  If the currently referenced value is a JSON object, the new
      referenced value is the object member with the name identified by
      the reference token.  The member name is equal to the token if it
      has the same number of Unicode characters as the token and their
      code points are byte-by-byte equal.  No Unicode character
      normalization is performed.  If a referenced member name is not
      unique in an object, the member that is referenced is undefined,
      and evaluation fails (see below).










Bryan, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 3]

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   o  If the currently referenced value is a JSON array, the reference
      token MUST contain either:

      *  characters comprised of digits (see ABNF below; note that
         leading zeros are not allowed) that represent an unsigned
         base-10 integer value, making the new referenced value the
         array element with the zero-based index identified by the
         token, or

      *  exactly the single character "-", making the new referenced
         value the (nonexistent) member after the last array element.

   The ABNF syntax for array indices is:

   array-index = %x30 / ( %x31-39 *(%x30-39) )
                 ; "0", or digits without a leading "0"

   Implementations will evaluate each reference token against the
   document's contents and will raise an error condition if it fails to
   resolve a concrete value for any of the JSON pointer's reference
   tokens.  For example, if an array is referenced with a non-numeric
   token, an error condition will be raised.  See Section 7 for details.

   Note that the use of the "-" character to index an array will always
   result in such an error condition because by definition it refers to
   a nonexistent array element.  Thus, applications of JSON Pointer need
   to specify how that character is to be handled, if it is to be
   useful.

   Any error condition for which a specific action is not defined by the
   JSON Pointer application results in termination of evaluation.

5.  JSON String Representation

   A JSON Pointer can be represented in a JSON string value.  Per
   [RFC4627], Section 2.5, all instances of quotation mark '"' (%x22),
   reverse solidus '\' (%x5C), and control (%x00-1F) characters MUST be
   escaped.

   Note that before processing a JSON string as a JSON Pointer,
   backslash escape sequences must be unescaped.










Bryan, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 4]

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   For example, given the JSON document

   {
      "foo": ["bar", "baz"],
      "": 0,
      "a/b": 1,
      "c%d": 2,
      "e^f": 3,
      "g|h": 4,
      "i\\j": 5,
      "k\"l": 6,
      " ": 7,
      "m~n": 8
   }

   The following JSON strings evaluate to the accompanying values:

    ""           // the whole document
    "/foo"       ["bar", "baz"]
    "/foo/0"     "bar"
    "/"          0
    "/a~1b"      1
    "/c%d"       2
    "/e^f"       3
    "/g|h"       4
    "/i\\j"      5
    "/k\"l"      6
    "/ "         7
    "/m~0n"      8

6.  URI Fragment Identifier Representation

   A JSON Pointer can be represented in a URI fragment identifier by
   encoding it into octets using UTF-8 [RFC3629], while percent-encoding
   those characters not allowed by the fragment rule in [RFC3986].

   Note that a given media type needs to specify JSON Pointer as its
   fragment identifier syntax explicitly (usually, in its registration
   [RFC6838]).  That is, just because a document is JSON does not imply
   that JSON Pointer can be used as its fragment identifier syntax.  In
   particular, the fragment identifier syntax for application/json is
   not JSON Pointer.









Bryan, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 5]

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   Given the same example document as above, the following URI fragment
   identifiers evaluate to the accompanying values:

    #            // the whole document
    #/foo        ["bar", "baz"]
    #/foo/0      "bar"
    #/           0
    #/a~1b       1
    #/c%25d      2
    #/e%5Ef      3
    #/g%7Ch      4
    #/i%5Cj      5
    #/k%22l      6
    #/%20        7
    #/m~0n       8

7.  Error Handling

   In the event of an error condition, evaluation of the JSON Pointer
   fails to complete.

   Error conditions include, but are not limited to:

   o  Invalid pointer syntax

   o  A pointer that references a nonexistent value

   This specification does not define how errors are handled.  An
   application of JSON Pointer SHOULD specify the impact and handling of
   each type of error.

   For example, some applications might stop pointer processing upon an
   error, while others may attempt to recover from missing values by
   inserting default ones.

8.  Security Considerations

   A given JSON Pointer is not guaranteed to reference an actual JSON
   value.  Therefore, applications using JSON Pointer should anticipate
   this situation by defining how a pointer that does not resolve ought
   to be handled.

   Note that JSON pointers can contain the NUL (Unicode U+0000)
   character.  Care is needed not to misinterpret this character in
   programming languages that use NUL to mark the end of a string.

1.  Introduction

   This specification defines JSON Pointer, a string syntax for
   identifying a specific value within a JavaScript Object Notation
   (JSON) document [RFC4627].  JSON Pointer is intended to be easily
   expressed in JSON string values as well as Uniform Resource

   This specification expresses normative syntax rules using Augmented
   Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234] notation.

3.  Syntax

   A JSON Pointer is a Unicode string (see [RFC4627], Section 3)
   containing a sequence of zero or more reference tokens, each prefixed
   by a '/' (%x2F) character.

   Because the characters '~' (%x7E) and '/' (%x2F) have special
   meanings in JSON Pointer, '~' needs to be encoded as '~0' and '/'
   needs to be encoded as '~1' when these characters appear in a
   reference token.

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   The ABNF syntax of a JSON Pointer is:

      json-pointer    = *( "/" reference-token )
      reference-token = *( unescaped / escaped )
      unescaped       = %x00-2E / %x30-7D / %x7F-10FFFF
         ; %x2F ('/') and %x7E ('~') are excluded from 'unescaped'
      escaped         = "~" ( "0" / "1" )
        ; representing '~' and '/', respectively

   It is an error condition if a JSON Pointer value does not conform to
   this syntax (see Section 7).

   Note that JSON Pointers are specified in characters, not as bytes.

4.  Evaluation

   Evaluation of a JSON Pointer begins with a reference to the root
   value of a JSON document and completes with a reference to some value
   within the document.  Each reference token in the JSON Pointer is
   evaluated sequentially.

   Evaluation of each reference token begins by decoding any escaped
   character sequence.  This is performed by first transforming any
   occurrence of the sequence '~1' to '/', and then transforming any
   occurrence of the sequence '~0' to '~'.  By performing the
   substitutions in this order, an implementation avoids the error of
   turning '~01' first into '~1' and then into '/', which would be
   incorrect (the string '~01' correctly becomes '~1' after
   transformation).

   The reference token then modifies which value is referenced according
   to the following scheme:

   o  If the currently referenced value is a JSON object, the new
      referenced value is the object member with the name identified by
      the reference token.  The member name is equal to the token if it
      has the same number of Unicode characters as the token and their
      code points are byte-by-byte equal.  No Unicode character
      normalization is performed.  If a referenced member name is not
      unique in an object, the member that is referenced is undefined,
      and evaluation fails (see below).










Bryan, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 3]

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   o  If the currently referenced value is a JSON array, the reference
      token MUST contain either:

      *  characters comprised of digits (see ABNF below; note that
         leading zeros are not allowed) that represent an unsigned
         base-10 integer value, making the new referenced value the
         array element with the zero-based index identified by the
         token, or

      *  exactly the single character "-", making the new referenced
         value the (nonexistent) member after the last array element.

   The ABNF syntax for array indices is:

   array-index = %x30 / ( %x31-39 *(%x30-39) )
                 ; "0", or digits without a leading "0"

   Implementations will evaluate each reference token against the
   document's contents and will raise an error condition if it fails to
   resolve a concrete value for any of the JSON pointer's reference
   tokens.  For example, if an array is referenced with a non-numeric
   token, an error condition will be raised.  See Section 7 for details.

   Note that the use of the "-" character to index an array will always
   result in such an error condition because by definition it refers to
   a nonexistent array element.  Thus, applications of JSON Pointer need
   to specify how that character is to be handled, if it is to be
   useful.

   [RFC4627], Section 2.5, all instances of quotation mark '"' (%x22),

   escaped.

   Note that before processing a JSON string as a JSON Pointer,
   backslash escape sequences must be unescaped.

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   For example, given the JSON document

   {
      "foo": ["bar", "baz"],
      "": 0,
      "a/b": 1,
      "c%d": 2,
      "e^f": 3,
      "g|h": 4,
      "i\\j": 5,
      "k\"l": 6,
      " ": 7,
      "m~n": 8
   }

   The following JSON strings evaluate to the accompanying values:

    ""           // the whole document
    "/foo"       ["bar", "baz"]
    "/foo/0"     "bar"
    "/"          0
    "/a~1b"      1
    "/c%d"       2
    "/e^f"       3
    "/g|h"       4
    "/i\\j"      5
    "/k\"l"      6
    "/ "         7
    "/m~0n"      8

   that JSON Pointer can be used as its fragment identifier syntax.  In
   particular, the fragment identifier syntax for application/json is
   not JSON Pointer.

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   Given the same example document as above, the following URI fragment
   identifiers evaluate to the accompanying values:

    #            // the whole document
    #/foo        ["bar", "baz"]
    #/foo/0      "bar"
    #/           0
    #/a~1b       1
    #/c%25d      2
    #/e%5Ef      3

    #/k%22l      6
    #/%20        7
    #/m~0n       8

7.  Error Handling

   In the event of an error condition, evaluation of the JSON Pointer
   fails to complete.

   Error conditions include, but are not limited to:

   o  Invalid pointer syntax

   o  A pointer that references a nonexistent value

   This specification does not define how errors are handled.  An
   application of JSON Pointer SHOULD specify the impact and handling of
   each type of error.

   For example, some applications might stop pointer processing upon an
   error, while others may attempt to recover from missing values by
   inserting default ones.

8.  Security Considerations

   A given JSON Pointer is not guaranteed to reference an actual JSON
   value.  Therefore, applications using JSON Pointer should anticipate
   this situation by defining how a pointer that does not resolve ought
   to be handled.

   Note that JSON pointers can contain the NUL (Unicode U+0000)
   character.  Care is needed not to misinterpret this character in
   programming languages that use NUL to mark the end of a string.

1.  Introduction

   This specification defines JSON Pointer, a string syntax for
   identifying a specific value within a JavaScript Object Notation
   (JSON) document [RFC4627].  JSON Pointer is intended to be easily
   expressed in JSON string values as well as Uniform Resource
   Identifier (URI) [RFC3986] fragment identifiers.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This specification expresses normative syntax rules using Augmented
   Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234] notation.

3.  Syntax

   A JSON Pointer is a Unicode string (see [RFC4627], Section 3)
   containing a sequence of zero or more reference tokens, each prefixed
   by a '/' (%x2F) character.

   Because the characters '~' (%x7E) and '/' (%x2F) have special
   meanings in JSON Pointer, '~' needs to be encoded as '~0' and '/'
   needs to be encoded as '~1' when these characters appear in a
   reference token.









Bryan, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 2]

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   The ABNF syntax of a JSON Pointer is:

      json-pointer    = *( "/" reference-token )
      reference-token = *( unescaped / escaped )
      unescaped       = %x00-2E / %x30-7D / %x7F-10FFFF
         ; %x2F ('/') and %x7E ('~') are excluded from 'unescaped'
      escaped         = "~" ( "0" / "1" )
        ; representing '~' and '/', respectively

   It is an error condition if a JSON Pointer value does not conform to
   this syntax (see Section 7).

   Note that JSON Pointers are specified in characters, not as bytes.

4.  Evaluation

   Evaluation of a JSON Pointer begins with a reference to the root
   value of a JSON document and completes with a reference to some value
   within the document.  Each reference token in the JSON Pointer is
   evaluated sequentially.

   Evaluation of each reference token begins by decoding any escaped
   character sequence.  This is performed by first transforming any
   occurrence of the sequence '~1' to '/', and then transforming any
   occurrence of the sequence '~0' to '~'.  By performing the
   substitutions in this order, an implementation avoids the error of
   turning '~01' first into '~1' and then into '/', which would be
   incorrect (the string '~01' correctly becomes '~1' after
   transformation).

   The reference token then modifies which value is referenced according
   to the following scheme:

   o  If the currently referenced value is a JSON object, the new
      referenced value is the object member with the name identified by
      the reference token.  The member name is equal to the token if it
      has the same number of Unicode characters as the token and their
      code points are byte-by-byte equal.  No Unicode character
      normalization is performed.  If a referenced member name is not
      unique in an object, the member that is referenced is undefined,
      and evaluation fails (see below).










Bryan, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 3]

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   o  If the currently referenced value is a JSON array, the reference
      token MUST contain either:

      *  characters comprised of digits (see ABNF below; note that
         leading zeros are not allowed) that represent an unsigned
         base-10 integer value, making the new referenced value the
         array element with the zero-based index identified by the
         token, or

      *  exactly the single character "-", making the new referenced
         value the (nonexistent) member after the last array element.

   The ABNF syntax for array indices is:

   array-index = %x30 / ( %x31-39 *(%x30-39) )
                 ; "0", or digits without a leading "0"

   Implementations will evaluate each reference token against the
   document's contents and will raise an error condition if it fails to
   resolve a concrete value for any of the JSON pointer's reference
   tokens.  For example, if an array is referenced with a non-numeric
   token, an error condition will be raised.  See Section 7 for details.

   Note that the use of the "-" character to index an array will always
   result in such an error condition because by definition it refers to
   a nonexistent array element.  Thus, applications of JSON Pointer need
   to specify how that character is to be handled, if it is to be
   useful.

   Any error condition for which a specific action is not defined by the
   JSON Pointer application results in termination of evaluation.

5.  JSON String Representation

   A JSON Pointer can be represented in a JSON string value.  Per
   [RFC4627], Section 2.5, all instances of quotation mark '"' (%x22),
   reverse solidus '\' (%x5C), and control (%x00-1F) characters MUST be
   escaped.

   Note that before processing a JSON string as a JSON Pointer,
   backslash escape sequences must be unescaped.










Bryan, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 4]

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   For example, given the JSON document

   {
      "foo": ["bar", "baz"],
      "": 0,
      "a/b": 1,
      "c%d": 2,
      "e^f": 3,
      "g|h": 4,
      "i\\j": 5,
      "k\"l": 6,
      " ": 7,
      "m~n": 8
   }

   The following JSON strings evaluate to the accompanying values:

    ""           // the whole document
    "/foo"       ["bar", "baz"]
    "/foo/0"     "bar"
    "/"          0
    "/a~1b"      1
    "/c%d"       2
    "/e^f"       3
    "/g|h"       4
    "/i\\j"      5
    "/k\"l"      6
    "/ "         7
    "/m~0n"      8

6.  URI Fragment Identifier Representation

   A JSON Pointer can be represented in a URI fragment identifier by
   encoding it into octets using UTF-8 [RFC3629], while percent-encoding
   those characters not allowed by the fragment rule in [RFC3986].

   Note that a given media type needs to specify JSON Pointer as its
   fragment identifier syntax explicitly (usually, in its registration
   [RFC6838]).  That is, just because a document is JSON does not imply
   that JSON Pointer can be used as its fragment identifier syntax.  In
   particular, the fragment identifier syntax for application/json is
   not JSON Pointer.









Bryan, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 5]

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   Given the same example document as above, the following URI fragment
   identifiers evaluate to the accompanying values:

    #            // the whole document
    #/foo        ["bar", "baz"]
    #/foo/0      "bar"
    #/           0
    #/a~1b       1
    #/c%25d      2
    #/e%5Ef      3
    #/g%7Ch      4
    #/i%5Cj      5
    #/k%22l      6
    #/%20        7
    #/m~0n       8

7.  Error Handling

   In the event of an error condition, evaluation of the JSON Pointer
   fails to complete.

   Error conditions include, but are not limited to:

   o  Invalid pointer syntax

   o  A pointer that references a nonexistent value

   This specification does not define how errors are handled.  An
   application of JSON Pointer SHOULD specify the impact and handling of
   each type of error.

   For example, some applications might stop pointer processing upon an
   error, while others may attempt to recover from missing values by
   inserting default ones.

8.  Security Considerations

   A given JSON Pointer is not guaranteed to reference an actual JSON
   value.  Therefore, applications using JSON Pointer should anticipate
   this situation by defining how a pointer that does not resolve ought
   to be handled.

   Note that JSON pointers can contain the NUL (Unicode U+0000)
   character.  Care is needed not to misinterpret this character in
   programming languages that use NUL to mark the end of a string.

   The ABNF syntax of a JSON Pointer is:

      json-pointer    = *( "/" reference-token )
      reference-token = *( unescaped / escaped )
      unescaped       = %x00-2E / %x30-7D / %x7F-10FFFF
         ; %x2F ('/') and %x7E ('~') are excluded from 'unescaped'
      escaped         = "~" ( "0" / "1" )
        ; representing '~' and '/', respectively

   It is an error condition if a JSON Pointer value does not conform to
   this syntax (see Section 7).

   Note that JSON Pointers are specified in characters, not as bytes.

4.  Evaluation

   Evaluation of a JSON Pointer begins with a reference to the root
   value of a JSON document and completes with a reference to some value
   within the document.  Each reference token in the JSON Pointer is
   evaluated sequentially.

   Evaluation of each reference token begins by decoding any escaped
   character sequence.  This is performed by first transforming any
   occurrence of the sequence '~1' to '/', and then transforming any
   occurrence of the sequence '~0' to '~'.  By performing the
   substitutions in this order, an implementation avoids the error of
   turning '~01' first into '~1' and then into '/', which would be
   incorrect (the string '~01' correctly becomes '~1' after
   transformation).

   The reference token then modifies which value is referenced according
   to the following scheme:

   o  If the currently referenced value is a JSON object, the new
      referenced value is the object member with the name identified by
      the reference token.  The member name is equal to the token if it
      has the same number of Unicode characters as the token and their
      code points are byte-by-byte equal.  No Unicode character
      normalization is performed.  If a referenced member name is not
      unique in an object, the member that is referenced is undefined,
      and evaluation fails (see below).










Bryan, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 3]

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   o  If the currently referenced value is a JSON array, the reference
      token MUST contain either:

      *  characters comprised of digits (see ABNF below; note that
         leading zeros are not allowed) that represent an unsigned
         base-10 integer value, making the new referenced value the
         array element with the zero-based index identified by the
         token, or

      *  exactly the single character "-", making the new referenced
         value the (nonexistent) member after the last array element.

   The ABNF syntax for array indices is:

   array-index = %x30 / ( %x31-39 *(%x30-39) )
                 ; "0", or digits without a leading "0"

   Implementations will evaluate each reference token against the
   document's contents and will raise an error condition if it fails to
   resolve a concrete value for any of the JSON pointer's reference
   tokens.  For example, if an array is referenced with a non-numeric
   token, an error condition will be raised.  See Section 7 for details.

   Note that the use of the "-" character to index an array will always
   result in such an error condition because by definition it refers to
   a nonexistent array element.  Thus, applications of JSON Pointer need
   to specify how that character is to be handled, if it is to be
   useful.

   Any error condition for which a specific action is not defined by the
   JSON Pointer application results in termination of evaluation.

5.  JSON String Representation

   A JSON Pointer can be represented in a JSON string value.  Per
   [RFC4627], Section 2.5, all instances of quotation mark '"' (%x22),
   reverse solidus '\' (%x5C), and control (%x00-1F) characters MUST be
   escaped.

   Note that before processing a JSON string as a JSON Pointer,
   backslash escape sequences must be unescaped.










Bryan, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 4]

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   For example, given the JSON document

   {
      "foo": ["bar", "baz"],
      "": 0,
      "a/b": 1,
      "c%d": 2,
      "e^f": 3,
      "g|h": 4,
      "i\\j": 5,
      "k\"l": 6,
      " ": 7,
      "m~n": 8
   }

   The following JSON strings evaluate to the accompanying values:

    ""           // the whole document
    "/foo"       ["bar", "baz"]
    "/foo/0"     "bar"
    "/"          0
    "/a~1b"      1
    "/c%d"       2
    "/e^f"       3
    "/g|h"       4
    "/i\\j"      5
    "/k\"l"      6
    "/ "         7
    "/m~0n"      8

6.  URI Fragment Identifier Representation

   A JSON Pointer can be represented in a URI fragment identifier by
   encoding it into octets using UTF-8 [RFC3629], while percent-encoding
   those characters not allowed by the fragment rule in [RFC3986].

   Note that a given media type needs to specify JSON Pointer as its
   fragment identifier syntax explicitly (usually, in its registration
   [RFC6838]).  That is, just because a document is JSON does not imply
   that JSON Pointer can be used as its fragment identifier syntax.  In
   particular, the fragment identifier syntax for application/json is
   not JSON Pointer.









Bryan, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 5]

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   Given the same example document as above, the following URI fragment
   identifiers evaluate to the accompanying values:

    #            // the whole document
    #/foo        ["bar", "baz"]
    #/foo/0      "bar"
    #/           0
    #/a~1b       1
    #/c%25d      2
    #/e%5Ef      3
    #/g%7Ch      4
    #/i%5Cj      5
    #/k%22l      6
    #/%20        7
    #/m~0n       8

7.  Error Handling

   In the event of an error condition, evaluation of the JSON Pointer
   fails to complete.

   Error conditions include, but are not limited to:

   o  Invalid pointer syntax

   o  A pointer that references a nonexistent value

   This specification does not define how errors are handled.  An
   application of JSON Pointer SHOULD specify the impact and handling of
   each type of error.

   For example, some applications might stop pointer processing upon an
   error, while others may attempt to recover from missing values by
   inserting default ones.

8.  Security Considerations

   A given JSON Pointer is not guaranteed to reference an actual JSON
   value.  Therefore, applications using JSON Pointer should anticipate
   this situation by defining how a pointer that does not resolve ought
   to be handled.

   Note that JSON pointers can contain the NUL (Unicode U+0000)
   character.  Care is needed not to misinterpret this character in
   programming languages that use NUL to mark the end of a string.

1.  Introduction

   This specification defines JSON Pointer, a string syntax for
   identifying a specific value within a JavaScript Object Notation
   (JSON) document [RFC4627].  JSON Pointer is intended to be easily
   expressed in JSON string values as well as Uniform Resource
   Identifier (URI) [RFC3986] fragment identifiers.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This specification expresses normative syntax rules using Augmented
   Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234] notation.

3.  Syntax

   A JSON Pointer is a Unicode string (see [RFC4627], Section 3)
   containing a sequence of zero or more reference tokens, each prefixed
   by a '/' (%x2F) character.

   Because the characters '~' (%x7E) and '/' (%x2F) have special
   meanings in JSON Pointer, '~' needs to be encoded as '~0' and '/'
   needs to be encoded as '~1' when these characters appear in a
   reference token.









Bryan, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 2]

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   The ABNF syntax of a JSON Pointer is:

      json-pointer    = *( "/" reference-token )
      reference-token = *( unescaped / escaped )
      unescaped       = %x00-2E / %x30-7D / %x7F-10FFFF
         ; %x2F ('/') and %x7E ('~') are excluded from 'unescaped'
      escaped         = "~" ( "0" / "1" )
        ; representing '~' and '/', respectively

   It is an error condition if a JSON Pointer value does not conform to
   this syntax (see Section 7).

   Note that JSON Pointers are specified in characters, not as bytes.

4.  Evaluation

   Evaluation of a JSON Pointer begins with a reference to the root
   value of a JSON document and completes with a reference to some value
   within the document.  Each reference token in the JSON Pointer is
   evaluated sequentially.

   Evaluation of each reference token begins by decoding any escaped
   character sequence.  This is performed by first transforming any
   occurrence of the sequence '~1' to '/', and then transforming any
   occurrence of the sequence '~0' to '~'.  By performing the
   substitutions in this order, an implementation avoids the error of
   turning '~01' first into '~1' and then into '/', which would be
   incorrect (the string '~01' correctly becomes '~1' after
   transformation).

   The reference token then modifies which value is referenced according
   to the following scheme:

   o  If the currently referenced value is a JSON object, the new
      referenced value is the object member with the name identified by
      the reference token.  The member name is equal to the token if it
      has the same number of Unicode characters as the token and their
      code points are byte-by-byte equal.  No Unicode character
      normalization is performed.  If a referenced member name is not
      unique in an object, the member that is referenced is undefined,
      and evaluation fails (see below).










Bryan, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 3]

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   o  If the currently referenced value is a JSON array, the reference
      token MUST contain either:

      *  characters comprised of digits (see ABNF below; note that
         leading zeros are not allowed) that represent an unsigned
         base-10 integer value, making the new referenced value the
         array element with the zero-based index identified by the
         token, or

      *  exactly the single character "-", making the new referenced
         value the (nonexistent) member after the last array element.

   The ABNF syntax for array indices is:

   array-index = %x30 / ( %x31-39 *(%x30-39) )
                 ; "0", or digits without a leading "0"

   Implementations will evaluate each reference token against the
   document's contents and will raise an error condition if it fails to
   resolve a concrete value for any of the JSON pointer's reference
   tokens.  For example, if an array is referenced with a non-numeric
   token, an error condition will be raised.  See Section 7 for details.

   Note that the use of the "-" character to index an array will always
   result in such an error condition because by definition it refers to
   a nonexistent array element.  Thus, applications of JSON Pointer need
   to specify how that character is to be handled, if it is to be
   useful.

   Any error condition for which a specific action is not defined by the
   JSON Pointer application results in termination of evaluation.

   [RFC4627], Section 2.5, all instances of quotation mark '"' (%x22),

   escaped.

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   For example, given the JSON document

   {
      "foo": ["bar", "baz"],
      "": 0,
      "a/b": 1,
      "c%d": 2,

      "i\\j": 5,
      "k\"l": 6,
      " ": 7,
      "m~n": 8
   }

   The following JSON strings evaluate to the accompanying values:

    ""           // the whole document
    "/foo"       ["bar", "baz"]
    "/foo/0"     "bar"
    "/"          0
    "/a~1b"      1
    "/c%d"       2
    "/e^f"       3
    "/g|h"       4
    "/i\\j"      5

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   Given the same example document as above, the following URI fragment
   identifiers evaluate to the accompanying values:

    #            // the whole document
    #/foo        ["bar", "baz"]
    #/foo/0      "bar"

    #/k%22l      6
    #/%20        7
    #/m~0n       8

7.  Error Handling

   In the event of an error condition, evaluation of the JSON Pointer
   fails to complete.

   Error conditions include, but are not limited to:

   o  Invalid pointer syntax

   o  A pointer that references a nonexistent value

   This specification does not define how errors are handled.  An
   application of JSON Pointer SHOULD specify the impact and handling of
   each type of error.

   For example, some applications might stop pointer processing upon an
   error, while others may attempt to recover from missing values by

   value.  Therefore, applications using JSON Pointer should anticipate

   to be handled.

   Note that JSON pointers can contain the NUL (Unicode U+0000)
   character.  Care is needed not to misinterpret this character in
   programming languages that use NUL to mark the end of a string.

1.  Introduction

   This specification defines JSON Pointer, a string syntax for
   identifying a specific value within a JavaScript Object Notation
   (JSON) document [RFC4627].  JSON Pointer is intended to be easily
   expressed in JSON string values as well as Uniform Resource
   Identifier (URI) [RFC3986] fragment identifiers.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This specification expresses normative syntax rules using Augmented
   Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234] notation.

3.  Syntax

   A JSON Pointer is a Unicode string (see [RFC4627], Section 3)
   containing a sequence of zero or more reference tokens, each prefixed
   by a '/' (%x2F) character.

   Because the characters '~' (%x7E) and '/' (%x2F) have special
   meanings in JSON Pointer, '~' needs to be encoded as '~0' and '/'
   needs to be encoded as '~1' when these characters appear in a
   reference token.









Bryan, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 2]

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   The ABNF syntax of a JSON Pointer is:

      json-pointer    = *( "/" reference-token )
      reference-token = *( unescaped / escaped )
      unescaped       = %x00-2E / %x30-7D / %x7F-10FFFF
         ; %x2F ('/') and %x7E ('~') are excluded from 'unescaped'
      escaped         = "~" ( "0" / "1" )
        ; representing '~' and '/', respectively

   It is an error condition if a JSON Pointer value does not conform to
   this syntax (see Section 7).

   Note that JSON Pointers are specified in characters, not as bytes.

4.  Evaluation

   Evaluation of a JSON Pointer begins with a reference to the root
   value of a JSON document and completes with a reference to some value
   within the document.  Each reference token in the JSON Pointer is
   evaluated sequentially.

   Evaluation of each reference token begins by decoding any escaped
   character sequence.  This is performed by first transforming any
   occurrence of the sequence '~1' to '/', and then transforming any
   occurrence of the sequence '~0' to '~'.  By performing the
   substitutions in this order, an implementation avoids the error of
   turning '~01' first into '~1' and then into '/', which would be
   incorrect (the string '~01' correctly becomes '~1' after
   transformation).

   The reference token then modifies which value is referenced according
   to the following scheme:

   o  If the currently referenced value is a JSON object, the new
      referenced value is the object member with the name identified by
      the reference token.  The member name is equal to the token if it
      has the same number of Unicode characters as the token and their
      code points are byte-by-byte equal.  No Unicode character
      normalization is performed.  If a referenced member name is not
      unique in an object, the member that is referenced is undefined,
      and evaluation fails (see below).










Bryan, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 3]

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   o  If the currently referenced value is a JSON array, the reference
      token MUST contain either:

      *  characters comprised of digits (see ABNF below; note that
         leading zeros are not allowed) that represent an unsigned
         base-10 integer value, making the new referenced value the
         array element with the zero-based index identified by the
         token, or

      *  exactly the single character "-", making the new referenced
         value the (nonexistent) member after the last array element.

   The ABNF syntax for array indices is:

   array-index = %x30 / ( %x31-39 *(%x30-39) )
                 ; "0", or digits without a leading "0"

   Implementations will evaluate each reference token against the
   document's contents and will raise an error condition if it fails to
   resolve a concrete value for any of the JSON pointer's reference
   tokens.  For example, if an array is referenced with a non-numeric
   token, an error condition will be raised.  See Section 7 for details.

   Note that the use of the "-" character to index an array will always
   result in such an error condition because by definition it refers to
   a nonexistent array element.  Thus, applications of JSON Pointer need
   to specify how that character is to be handled, if it is to be
   useful.

   Any error condition for which a specific action is not defined by the
   JSON Pointer application results in termination of evaluation.

5.  JSON String Representation

   A JSON Pointer can be represented in a JSON string value.  Per
   [RFC4627], Section 2.5, all instances of quotation mark '"' (%x22),
   reverse solidus '\' (%x5C), and control (%x00-1F) characters MUST be
   escaped.

   Note that before processing a JSON string as a JSON Pointer,
   backslash escape sequences must be unescaped.










Bryan, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 4]

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   For example, given the JSON document

   {
      "foo": ["bar", "baz"],
      "": 0,
      "a/b": 1,
      "c%d": 2,
      "e^f": 3,
      "g|h": 4,
      "i\\j": 5,
      "k\"l": 6,
      " ": 7,
      "m~n": 8
   }

   The following JSON strings evaluate to the accompanying values:

    ""           // the whole document
    "/foo"       ["bar", "baz"]
    "/foo/0"     "bar"
    "/"          0
    "/a~1b"      1
    "/c%d"       2
    "/e^f"       3
    "/g|h"       4
    "/i\\j"      5
    "/k\"l"      6
    "/ "         7
    "/m~0n"      8

6.  URI Fragment Identifier Representation

   A JSON Pointer can be represented in a URI fragment identifier by
   encoding it into octets using UTF-8 [RFC3629], while percent-encoding
   those characters not allowed by the fragment rule in [RFC3986].

   Note that a given media type needs to specify JSON Pointer as its
   fragment identifier syntax explicitly (usually, in its registration
   [RFC6838]).  That is, just because a document is JSON does not imply
   that JSON Pointer can be used as its fragment identifier syntax.  In
   particular, the fragment identifier syntax for application/json is
   not JSON Pointer.









Bryan, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 5]

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   Given the same example document as above, the following URI fragment
   identifiers evaluate to the accompanying values:

    #            // the whole document
    #/foo        ["bar", "baz"]
    #/foo/0      "bar"
    #/           0
    #/a~1b       1
    #/c%25d      2
    #/e%5Ef      3
    #/g%7Ch      4
    #/i%5Cj      5
    #/k%22l      6
    #/%20        7
    #/m~0n       8

7.  Error Handling

   In the event of an error condition, evaluation of the JSON Pointer
   fails to complete.

   Error conditions include, but are not limited to:

   o  Invalid pointer syntax

   o  A pointer that references a nonexistent value

   This specification does not define how errors are handled.  An
   application of JSON Pointer SHOULD specify the impact and handling of
   each type of error.

   For example, some applications might stop pointer processing upon an
   error, while others may attempt to recover from missing values by
   inserting default ones.

8.  Security Considerations

   A given JSON Pointer is not guaranteed to reference an actual JSON
   value.  Therefore, applications using JSON Pointer should anticipate
   this situation by defining how a pointer that does not resolve ought
   to be handled.

   Note that JSON pointers can contain the NUL (Unicode U+0000)
   character.  Care is needed not to misinterpret this character in
   programming languages that use NUL to mark the end of a string.

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   The ABNF syntax of a JSON Pointer is:

      json-pointer    = *( "/" reference-token )
      reference-token = *( unescaped / escaped )
      unescaped       = %x00-2E / %x30-7D / %x7F-10FFFF
         ; %x2F ('/') and %x7E ('~') are excluded from 'unescaped'
      escaped         = "~" ( "0" / "1" )
        ; representing '~' and '/', respectively

   It is an error condition if a JSON Pointer value does not conform to
   this syntax (see Section 7).

   Note that JSON Pointers are specified in characters, not as bytes.

4.  Evaluation

   Evaluation of a JSON Pointer begins with a reference to the root
   value of a JSON document and completes with a reference to some value
   within the document.  Each reference token in the JSON Pointer is
   evaluated sequentially.

   Evaluation of each reference token begins by decoding any escaped
   character sequence.  This is performed by first transforming any
   occurrence of the sequence '~1' to '/', and then transforming any
   occurrence of the sequence '~0' to '~'.  By performing the
   substitutions in this order, an implementation avoids the error of
   turning '~01' first into '~1' and then into '/', which would be
   incorrect (the string '~01' correctly becomes '~1' after
   transformation).

   The reference token then modifies which value is referenced according
   to the following scheme:

   o  If the currently referenced value is a JSON object, the new
      referenced value is the object member with the name identified by
      the reference token.  The member name is equal to the token if it
      has the same number of Unicode characters as the token and their
      code points are byte-by-byte equal.  No Unicode character
      normalization is performed.  If a referenced member name is not
      unique in an object, the member that is referenced is undefined,
      and evaluation fails (see below).










Bryan, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 3]

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   o  If the currently referenced value is a JSON array, the reference
      token MUST contain either:

      *  characters comprised of digits (see ABNF below; note that
         leading zeros are not allowed) that represent an unsigned
         base-10 integer value, making the new referenced value the
         array element with the zero-based index identified by the
         token, or

      *  exactly the single character "-", making the new referenced
         value the (nonexistent) member after the last array element.

   The ABNF syntax for array indices is:

   array-index = %x30 / ( %x31-39 *(%x30-39) )
                 ; "0", or digits without a leading "0"

   Implementations will evaluate each reference token against the
   document's contents and will raise an error condition if it fails to
   resolve a concrete value for any of the JSON pointer's reference
   tokens.  For example, if an array is referenced with a non-numeric
   token, an error condition will be raised.  See Section 7 for details.

   Note that the use of the "-" character to index an array will always
   result in such an error condition because by definition it refers to
   a nonexistent array element.  Thus, applications of JSON Pointer need
   to specify how that character is to be handled, if it is to be
   useful.

   Any error condition for which a specific action is not defined by the
   JSON Pointer application results in termination of evaluation.

5.  JSON String Representation

   A JSON Pointer can be represented in a JSON string value.  Per
   [RFC4627], Section 2.5, all instances of quotation mark '"' (%x22),
   reverse solidus '\' (%x5C), and control (%x00-1F) characters MUST be
   escaped.

   Note that before processing a JSON string as a JSON Pointer,
   backslash escape sequences must be unescaped.










Bryan, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 4]

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   For example, given the JSON document

   {
      "foo": ["bar", "baz"],
      "": 0,
      "a/b": 1,
      "c%d": 2,
      "e^f": 3,
      "g|h": 4,
      "i\\j": 5,
      "k\"l": 6,
      " ": 7,
      "m~n": 8
   }

   The following JSON strings evaluate to the accompanying values:

    ""           // the whole document
    "/foo"       ["bar", "baz"]
    "/foo/0"     "bar"
    "/"          0
    "/a~1b"      1
    "/c%d"       2
    "/e^f"       3
    "/g|h"       4
    "/i\\j"      5
    "/k\"l"      6
    "/ "         7
    "/m~0n"      8

6.  URI Fragment Identifier Representation

   A JSON Pointer can be represented in a URI fragment identifier by
   encoding it into octets using UTF-8 [RFC3629], while percent-encoding
   those characters not allowed by the fragment rule in [RFC3986].

   Note that a given media type needs to specify JSON Pointer as its
   fragment identifier syntax explicitly (usually, in its registration
   [RFC6838]).  That is, just because a document is JSON does not imply
   that JSON Pointer can be used as its fragment identifier syntax.  In
   particular, the fragment identifier syntax for application/json is
   not JSON Pointer.









Bryan, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 5]

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   Given the same example document as above, the following URI fragment
   identifiers evaluate to the accompanying values:

    #            // the whole document
    #/foo        ["bar", "baz"]
    #/foo/0      "bar"
    #/           0
    #/a~1b       1
    #/c%25d      2
    #/e%5Ef      3
    #/g%7Ch      4
    #/i%5Cj      5
    #/k%22l      6
    #/%20        7
    #/m~0n       8

7.  Error Handling

   In the event of an error condition, evaluation of the JSON Pointer
   fails to complete.

   Error conditions include, but are not limited to:

   o  Invalid pointer syntax

   o  A pointer that references a nonexistent value

   This specification does not define how errors are handled.  An
   application of JSON Pointer SHOULD specify the impact and handling of
   each type of error.

   For example, some applications might stop pointer processing upon an
   error, while others may attempt to recover from missing values by
   inserting default ones.

8.  Security Considerations

   A given JSON Pointer is not guaranteed to reference an actual JSON
   value.  Therefore, applications using JSON Pointer should anticipate
   this situation by defining how a pointer that does not resolve ought
   to be handled.

   Note that JSON pointers can contain the NUL (Unicode U+0000)
   character.  Care is needed not to misinterpret this character in
   programming languages that use NUL to mark the end of a string.

1.  Introduction

   This specification defines JSON Pointer, a string syntax for
   identifying a specific value within a JavaScript Object Notation
   (JSON) document [RFC4627].  JSON Pointer is intended to be easily
   expressed in JSON string values as well as Uniform Resource
   Identifier (URI) [RFC3986] fragment identifiers.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This specification expresses normative syntax rules using Augmented
   Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234] notation.

3.  Syntax

   A JSON Pointer is a Unicode string (see [RFC4627], Section 3)
   containing a sequence of zero or more reference tokens, each prefixed
   by a '/' (%x2F) character.

   Because the characters '~' (%x7E) and '/' (%x2F) have special
   meanings in JSON Pointer, '~' needs to be encoded as '~0' and '/'
   needs to be encoded as '~1' when these characters appear in a
   reference token.









Bryan, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 2]

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   The ABNF syntax of a JSON Pointer is:

      json-pointer    = *( "/" reference-token )
      reference-token = *( unescaped / escaped )
      unescaped       = %x00-2E / %x30-7D / %x7F-10FFFF
         ; %x2F ('/') and %x7E ('~') are excluded from 'unescaped'
      escaped         = "~" ( "0" / "1" )
        ; representing '~' and '/', respectively

   It is an error condition if a JSON Pointer value does not conform to
   this syntax (see Section 7).

   Note that JSON Pointers are specified in characters, not as bytes.

4.  Evaluation

   Evaluation of a JSON Pointer begins with a reference to the root
   value of a JSON document and completes with a reference to some value
   within the document.  Each reference token in the JSON Pointer is
   evaluated sequentially.

   Evaluation of each reference token begins by decoding any escaped
   character sequence.  This is performed by first transforming any
   occurrence of the sequence '~1' to '/', and then transforming any
   occurrence of the sequence '~0' to '~'.  By performing the
   substitutions in this order, an implementation avoids the error of
   turning '~01' first into '~1' and then into '/', which would be
   incorrect (the string '~01' correctly becomes '~1' after
   transformation).

   The reference token then modifies which value is referenced according
   to the following scheme:

   o  If the currently referenced value is a JSON object, the new
      referenced value is the object member with the name identified by
      the reference token.  The member name is equal to the token if it
      has the same number of Unicode characters as the token and their
      code points are byte-by-byte equal.  No Unicode character
      normalization is performed.  If a referenced member name is not
      unique in an object, the member that is referenced is undefined,
      and evaluation fails (see below).










Bryan, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 3]

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   o  If the currently referenced value is a JSON array, the reference
      token MUST contain either:

      *  characters comprised of digits (see ABNF below; note that
         leading zeros are not allowed) that represent an unsigned
         base-10 integer value, making the new referenced value the
         array element with the zero-based index identified by the
         token, or

      *  exactly the single character "-", making the new referenced
         value the (nonexistent) member after the last array element.

   The ABNF syntax for array indices is:

   array-index = %x30 / ( %x31-39 *(%x30-39) )
                 ; "0", or digits without a leading "0"

   Implementations will evaluate each reference token against the
   document's contents and will raise an error condition if it fails to
   resolve a concrete value for any of the JSON pointer's reference
   tokens.  For example, if an array is referenced with a non-numeric
   token, an error condition will be raised.  See Section 7 for details.

   Note that the use of the "-" character to index an array will always
   result in such an error condition because by definition it refers to
   a nonexistent array element.  Thus, applications of JSON Pointer need
   to specify how that character is to be handled, if it is to be
   useful.

   Any error condition for which a specific action is not defined by the
   JSON Pointer application results in termination of evaluation.

5.  JSON String Representation

   A JSON Pointer can be represented in a JSON string value.  Per
   [RFC4627], Section 2.5, all instances of quotation mark '"' (%x22),
   reverse solidus '\' (%x5C), and control (%x00-1F) characters MUST be
   escaped.

   Note that before processing a JSON string as a JSON Pointer,
   backslash escape sequences must be unescaped.

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   For example, given the JSON document

   {
      "foo": ["bar", "baz"],
      "": 0,
      "a/b": 1,
      "c%d": 2,
      "e^f": 3,
      "g|h": 4,
      "i\\j": 5,
      "k\"l": 6,
      " ": 7,
      "m~n": 8
   }

   The following JSON strings evaluate to the accompanying values:

    ""           // the whole document
    "/foo"       ["bar", "baz"]
    "/foo/0"     "bar"
    "/"          0
    "/a~1b"      1
    "/c%d"       2
    "/e^f"       3
    "/g|h"       4
    "/i\\j"      5
    "/k\"l"      6
    "/ "         7

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   Given the same example document as above, the following URI fragment
   identifiers evaluate to the accompanying values:

    #            // the whole document
    #/foo        ["bar", "baz"]
    #/foo/0      "bar"
    #/           0
    #/a~1b       1
    #/c%25d      2
    #/e%5Ef      3
    #/g%7Ch      4
    #/i%5Cj      5
    #/k%22l      6
    #/%20        7
    #/m~0n       8

7.  Error Handling

   In the event of an error condition, evaluation of the JSON Pointer
   fails to complete.

   Error conditions include, but are not limited to:

   o  Invalid pointer syntax

   o  A pointer that references a nonexistent value

   This specification does not define how errors are handled.  An
   application of JSON Pointer SHOULD specify the impact and handling of

1.  Introduction

   This specification defines JSON Pointer, a string syntax for
   identifying a specific value within a JavaScript Object Notation
   (JSON) document [RFC4627].  JSON Pointer is intended to be easily
   expressed in JSON string values as well as Uniform Resource
   Identifier (URI) [RFC3986] fragment identifiers.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This specification expresses normative syntax rules using Augmented
   Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234] notation.

3.  Syntax

   A JSON Pointer is a Unicode string (see [RFC4627], Section 3)
   containing a sequence of zero or more reference tokens, each prefixed
   by a '/' (%x2F) character.

   Because the characters '~' (%x7E) and '/' (%x2F) have special
   meanings in JSON Pointer, '~' needs to be encoded as '~0' and '/'
   needs to be encoded as '~1' when these characters appear in a
   reference token.









Bryan, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 2]

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   The ABNF syntax of a JSON Pointer is:

      json-pointer    = *( "/" reference-token )
      reference-token = *( unescaped / escaped )
      unescaped       = %x00-2E / %x30-7D / %x7F-10FFFF
         ; %x2F ('/') and %x7E ('~') are excluded from 'unescaped'
      escaped         = "~" ( "0" / "1" )
        ; representing '~' and '/', respectively

   It is an error condition if a JSON Pointer value does not conform to
   this syntax (see Section 7).

   Note that JSON Pointers are specified in characters, not as bytes.

4.  Evaluation

   Evaluation of a JSON Pointer begins with a reference to the root
   value of a JSON document and completes with a reference to some value
   within the document.  Each reference token in the JSON Pointer is
   evaluated sequentially.

   Evaluation of each reference token begins by decoding any escaped
   character sequence.  This is performed by first transforming any
   occurrence of the sequence '~1' to '/', and then transforming any
   occurrence of the sequence '~0' to '~'.  By performing the
   substitutions in this order, an implementation avoids the error of
   turning '~01' first into '~1' and then into '/', which would be
   incorrect (the string '~01' correctly becomes '~1' after
   transformation).

   The reference token then modifies which value is referenced according
   to the following scheme:

   o  If the currently referenced value is a JSON object, the new
      referenced value is the object member with the name identified by
      the reference token.  The member name is equal to the token if it
      has the same number of Unicode characters as the token and their
      code points are byte-by-byte equal.  No Unicode character
      normalization is performed.  If a referenced member name is not
      unique in an object, the member that is referenced is undefined,
      and evaluation fails (see below).










Bryan, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 3]

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   o  If the currently referenced value is a JSON array, the reference
      token MUST contain either:

      *  characters comprised of digits (see ABNF below; note that
         leading zeros are not allowed) that represent an unsigned
         base-10 integer value, making the new referenced value the
         array element with the zero-based index identified by the
         token, or

      *  exactly the single character "-", making the new referenced
         value the (nonexistent) member after the last array element.

   The ABNF syntax for array indices is:

   array-index = %x30 / ( %x31-39 *(%x30-39) )
                 ; "0", or digits without a leading "0"

   Implementations will evaluate each reference token against the
   document's contents and will raise an error condition if it fails to
   resolve a concrete value for any of the JSON pointer's reference
   tokens.  For example, if an array is referenced with a non-numeric
   token, an error condition will be raised.  See Section 7 for details.

   Note that the use of the "-" character to index an array will always
   result in such an error condition because by definition it refers to
   a nonexistent array element.  Thus, applications of JSON Pointer need
   to specify how that character is to be handled, if it is to be
   useful.

   Any error condition for which a specific action is not defined by the
   JSON Pointer application results in termination of evaluation.

5.  JSON String Representation

   A JSON Pointer can be represented in a JSON string value.  Per
   [RFC4627], Section 2.5, all instances of quotation mark '"' (%x22),
   reverse solidus '\' (%x5C), and control (%x00-1F) characters MUST be
   escaped.

   Note that before processing a JSON string as a JSON Pointer,
   backslash escape sequences must be unescaped.










Bryan, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 4]

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   For example, given the JSON document

   {
      "foo": ["bar", "baz"],
      "": 0,
      "a/b": 1,
      "c%d": 2,
      "e^f": 3,
      "g|h": 4,
      "i\\j": 5,
      "k\"l": 6,
      " ": 7,
      "m~n": 8
   }

   The following JSON strings evaluate to the accompanying values:

    ""           // the whole document
    "/foo"       ["bar", "baz"]
    "/foo/0"     "bar"
    "/"          0
    "/a~1b"      1
    "/c%d"       2
    "/e^f"       3
    "/g|h"       4
    "/i\\j"      5
    "/k\"l"      6
    "/ "         7
    "/m~0n"      8

6.  URI Fragment Identifier Representation

   A JSON Pointer can be represented in a URI fragment identifier by
   encoding it into octets using UTF-8 [RFC3629], while percent-encoding
   those characters not allowed by the fragment rule in [RFC3986].

   Note that a given media type needs to specify JSON Pointer as its
   fragment identifier syntax explicitly (usually, in its registration
   [RFC6838]).  That is, just because a document is JSON does not imply
   that JSON Pointer can be used as its fragment identifier syntax.  In
   particular, the fragment identifier syntax for application/json is
   not JSON Pointer.









Bryan, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 5]

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   Given the same example document as above, the following URI fragment
   identifiers evaluate to the accompanying values:

    #            // the whole document
    #/foo        ["bar", "baz"]
    #/foo/0      "bar"
    #/           0
    #/a~1b       1
    #/c%25d      2
    #/e%5Ef      3
    #/g%7Ch      4
    #/i%5Cj      5
    #/k%22l      6
    #/%20        7
    #/m~0n       8

7.  Error Handling

   In the event of an error condition, evaluation of the JSON Pointer
   fails to complete.

   Error conditions include, but are not limited to:

   o  Invalid pointer syntax

   o  A pointer that references a nonexistent value

   This specification does not define how errors are handled.  An
   application of JSON Pointer SHOULD specify the impact and handling of
   each type of error.

   For example, some applications might stop pointer processing upon an
   error, while others may attempt to recover from missing values by
   inserting default ones.

8.  Security Considerations

   A given JSON Pointer is not guaranteed to reference an actual JSON
   value.  Therefore, applications using JSON Pointer should anticipate
   this situation by defining how a pointer that does not resolve ought
   to be handled.

   Note that JSON pointers can contain the NUL (Unicode U+0000)
   character.  Care is needed not to misinterpret this character in
   programming languages that use NUL to mark the end of a string.

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   The ABNF syntax of a JSON Pointer is:

      json-pointer    = *( "/" reference-token )
      reference-token = *( unescaped / escaped )
      unescaped       = %x00-2E / %x30-7D / %x7F-10FFFF
         ; %x2F ('/') and %x7E ('~') are excluded from 'unescaped'
      escaped         = "~" ( "0" / "1" )
        ; representing '~' and '/', respectively

   It is an error condition if a JSON Pointer value does not conform to
   this syntax (see Section 7).

   Note that JSON Pointers are specified in characters, not as bytes.

4.  Evaluation

   Evaluation of a JSON Pointer begins with a reference to the root
   value of a JSON document and completes with a reference to some value
   within the document.  Each reference token in the JSON Pointer is
   evaluated sequentially.

   Evaluation of each reference token begins by decoding any escaped

   to the following scheme:

   o  If the currently referenced value is a JSON object, the new
      referenced value is the object member with the name identified by
      the reference token.  The member name is equal to the token if it
      has the same number of Unicode characters as the token and their
      code points are byte-by-byte equal.  No Unicode character
      normalization is performed.  If a referenced member name is not
      unique in an object, the member that is referenced is undefined,
      and evaluation fails (see below).

   o  If the currently referenced value is a JSON array, the reference
      token MUST contain either:

   a nonexistent array element.  Thus, applications of JSON Pointer need
   to specify how that character is to be handled, if it is to be
   useful.

   Any error condition for which a specific action is not defined by the
   JSON Pointer application results in termination of evaluation.

5.  JSON String Representation

   A JSON Pointer can be represented in a JSON string value.  Per
   [RFC4627], Section 2.5, all instances of quotation mark '"' (%x22),
   reverse solidus '\' (%x5C), and control (%x00-1F) characters MUST be
   escaped.

   Note that before processing a JSON string as a JSON Pointer,
   backslash escape sequences must be unescaped.










Bryan, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 4]

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   For example, given the JSON document

   {
      "foo": ["bar", "baz"],
      "": 0,
      "a/b": 1,
      "c%d": 2,
      "e^f": 3,
      "g|h": 4,
      "i\\j": 5,
      "k\"l": 6,
      " ": 7,
      "m~n": 8
   }

   The following JSON strings evaluate to the accompanying values:

    ""           // the whole document
    "/foo"       ["bar", "baz"]
    "/foo/0"     "bar"
    "/"          0
    "/a~1b"      1
    "/c%d"       2
    "/e^f"       3
    "/g|h"       4
    "/i\\j"      5
    "/k\"l"      6
    "/ "         7
    "/m~0n"      8

6.  URI Fragment Identifier Representation

   A JSON Pointer can be represented in a URI fragment identifier by
   encoding it into octets using UTF-8 [RFC3629], while percent-encoding
   those characters not allowed by the fragment rule in [RFC3986].

   Note that a given media type needs to specify JSON Pointer as its
   fragment identifier syntax explicitly (usually, in its registration
   [RFC6838]).  That is, just because a document is JSON does not imply
   that JSON Pointer can be used as its fragment identifier syntax.  In
   particular, the fragment identifier syntax for application/json is
   not JSON Pointer.









Bryan, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 5]

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   Given the same example document as above, the following URI fragment
   identifiers evaluate to the accompanying values:

    #            // the whole document
    #/foo        ["bar", "baz"]
    #/foo/0      "bar"
    #/           0
    #/a~1b       1
    #/c%25d      2
    #/e%5Ef      3
    #/g%7Ch      4
    #/i%5Cj      5
    #/k%22l      6
    #/%20        7
    #/m~0n       8

7.  Error Handling

   In the event of an error condition, evaluation of the JSON Pointer
   fails to complete.

   Error conditions include, but are not limited to:

   o  Invalid pointer syntax

   o  A pointer that references a nonexistent value

   This specification does not define how errors are handled.  An
   application of JSON Pointer SHOULD specify the impact and handling of
   each type of error.

   For example, some applications might stop pointer processing upon an
   error, while others may attempt to recover from missing values by
   inserting default ones.

8.  Security Considerations

   A given JSON Pointer is not guaranteed to reference an actual JSON
   value.  Therefore, applications using JSON Pointer should anticipate
   this situation by defining how a pointer that does not resolve ought
   to be handled.

   Note that JSON pointers can contain the NUL (Unicode U+0000)
   character.  Care is needed not to misinterpret this character in
   programming languages that use NUL to mark the end of a string.

1.  Introduction

   This specification defines JSON Pointer, a string syntax for
   identifying a specific value within a JavaScript Object Notation
   (JSON) document [RFC4627].  JSON Pointer is intended to be easily
   expressed in JSON string values as well as Uniform Resource
   Identifier (URI) [RFC3986] fragment identifiers.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This specification expresses normative syntax rules using Augmented
   Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234] notation.

3.  Syntax

   A JSON Pointer is a Unicode string (see [RFC4627], Section 3)
   containing a sequence of zero or more reference tokens, each prefixed
   by a '/' (%x2F) character.

   Because the characters '~' (%x7E) and '/' (%x2F) have special
   meanings in JSON Pointer, '~' needs to be encoded as '~0' and '/'
   needs to be encoded as '~1' when these characters appear in a
   reference token.









Bryan, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 2]

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   The ABNF syntax of a JSON Pointer is:

      json-pointer    = *( "/" reference-token )
      reference-token = *( unescaped / escaped )
      unescaped       = %x00-2E / %x30-7D / %x7F-10FFFF
         ; %x2F ('/') and %x7E ('~') are excluded from 'unescaped'
      escaped         = "~" ( "0" / "1" )
        ; representing '~' and '/', respectively

   It is an error condition if a JSON Pointer value does not conform to
   this syntax (see Section 7).

   Note that JSON Pointers are specified in characters, not as bytes.

4.  Evaluation

   Evaluation of a JSON Pointer begins with a reference to the root
   value of a JSON document and completes with a reference to some value
   within the document.  Each reference token in the JSON Pointer is
   evaluated sequentially.

   Evaluation of each reference token begins by decoding any escaped
   character sequence.  This is performed by first transforming any
   occurrence of the sequence '~1' to '/', and then transforming any
   occurrence of the sequence '~0' to '~'.  By performing the
   substitutions in this order, an implementation avoids the error of
   turning '~01' first into '~1' and then into '/', which would be
   incorrect (the string '~01' correctly becomes '~1' after
   transformation).

   The reference token then modifies which value is referenced according
   to the following scheme:

   o  If the currently referenced value is a JSON object, the new
      referenced value is the object member with the name identified by
      the reference token.  The member name is equal to the token if it
      has the same number of Unicode characters as the token and their
      code points are byte-by-byte equal.  No Unicode character
      normalization is performed.  If a referenced member name is not
      unique in an object, the member that is referenced is undefined,
      and evaluation fails (see below).










Bryan, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 3]

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   o  If the currently referenced value is a JSON array, the reference
      token MUST contain either:

      *  characters comprised of digits (see ABNF below; note that
         leading zeros are not allowed) that represent an unsigned
         base-10 integer value, making the new referenced value the
         array element with the zero-based index identified by the
         token, or

      *  exactly the single character "-", making the new referenced
         value the (nonexistent) member after the last array element.

   The ABNF syntax for array indices is:

   array-index = %x30 / ( %x31-39 *(%x30-39) )
                 ; "0", or digits without a leading "0"

   Implementations will evaluate each reference token against the
   document's contents and will raise an error condition if it fails to
   resolve a concrete value for any of the JSON pointer's reference
   tokens.  For example, if an array is referenced with a non-numeric
   token, an error condition will be raised.  See Section 7 for details.

   Note that the use of the "-" character to index an array will always
   result in such an error condition because by definition it refers to
   a nonexistent array element.  Thus, applications of JSON Pointer need
   to specify how that character is to be handled, if it is to be
   useful.

   Any error condition for which a specific action is not defined by the
   JSON Pointer application results in termination of evaluation.

5.  JSON String Representation

   A JSON Pointer can be represented in a JSON string value.  Per
   [RFC4627], Section 2.5, all instances of quotation mark '"' (%x22),
   reverse solidus '\' (%x5C), and control (%x00-1F) characters MUST be
   escaped.

   Note that before processing a JSON string as a JSON Pointer,
   backslash escape sequences must be unescaped.

   For example, given the JSON document

   {
      "foo": ["bar", "baz"],
      "": 0,
      "a/b": 1,
      "c%d": 2,
      "e^f": 3,

      "i\\j": 5,
      "k\"l": 6,
      " ": 7,
      "m~n": 8
   }

   The following JSON strings evaluate to the accompanying values:

    ""           // the whole document
    "/foo"       ["bar", "baz"]
    "/foo/0"     "bar"
    "/"          0
    "/a~1b"      1
    "/c%d"       2
    "/e^f"       3
    "/g|h"       4
    "/i\\j"      5
    "/k\"l"      6
    "/ "         7

   Given the same example document as above, the following URI fragment
   identifiers evaluate to the accompanying values:

    #            // the whole document
    #/foo        ["bar", "baz"]
    #/foo/0      "bar"
    #/           0
    #/a~1b       1

1.  Introduction

   This specification defines JSON Pointer, a string syntax for
   identifying a specific value within a JavaScript Object Notation
   (JSON) document [RFC4627].  JSON Pointer is intended to be easily
   expressed in JSON string values as well as Uniform Resource
   Identifier (URI) [RFC3986] fragment identifiers.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This specification expresses normative syntax rules using Augmented
   Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234] notation.

3.  Syntax

   A JSON Pointer is a Unicode string (see [RFC4627], Section 3)
   containing a sequence of zero or more reference tokens, each prefixed
   by a '/' (%x2F) character.

   Because the characters '~' (%x7E) and '/' (%x2F) have special
   meanings in JSON Pointer, '~' needs to be encoded as '~0' and '/'
   needs to be encoded as '~1' when these characters appear in a
   reference token.









Bryan, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 2]

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   The ABNF syntax of a JSON Pointer is:

      json-pointer    = *( "/" reference-token )
      reference-token = *( unescaped / escaped )
      unescaped       = %x00-2E / %x30-7D / %x7F-10FFFF
         ; %x2F ('/') and %x7E ('~') are excluded from 'unescaped'
      escaped         = "~" ( "0" / "1" )
        ; representing '~' and '/', respectively

   It is an error condition if a JSON Pointer value does not conform to
   this syntax (see Section 7).

   Note that JSON Pointers are specified in characters, not as bytes.

4.  Evaluation

   Evaluation of a JSON Pointer begins with a reference to the root
   value of a JSON document and completes with a reference to some value
   within the document.  Each reference token in the JSON Pointer is
   evaluated sequentially.

   Evaluation of each reference token begins by decoding any escaped
   character sequence.  This is performed by first transforming any
   occurrence of the sequence '~1' to '/', and then transforming any
   occurrence of the sequence '~0' to '~'.  By performing the
   substitutions in this order, an implementation avoids the error of
   turning '~01' first into '~1' and then into '/', which would be
   incorrect (the string '~01' correctly becomes '~1' after
   transformation).

   The reference token then modifies which value is referenced according
   to the following scheme:

   o  If the currently referenced value is a JSON object, the new
      referenced value is the object member with the name identified by
      the reference token.  The member name is equal to the token if it
      has the same number of Unicode characters as the token and their
      code points are byte-by-byte equal.  No Unicode character
      normalization is performed.  If a referenced member name is not
      unique in an object, the member that is referenced is undefined,
      and evaluation fails (see below).










Bryan, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 3]

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   o  If the currently referenced value is a JSON array, the reference
      token MUST contain either:

      *  characters comprised of digits (see ABNF below; note that
         leading zeros are not allowed) that represent an unsigned
         base-10 integer value, making the new referenced value the
         array element with the zero-based index identified by the
         token, or

      *  exactly the single character "-", making the new referenced
         value the (nonexistent) member after the last array element.

   The ABNF syntax for array indices is:

   array-index = %x30 / ( %x31-39 *(%x30-39) )
                 ; "0", or digits without a leading "0"

   Implementations will evaluate each reference token against the
   document's contents and will raise an error condition if it fails to
   resolve a concrete value for any of the JSON pointer's reference
   tokens.  For example, if an array is referenced with a non-numeric
   token, an error condition will be raised.  See Section 7 for details.

   Note that the use of the "-" character to index an array will always
   result in such an error condition because by definition it refers to
   a nonexistent array element.  Thus, applications of JSON Pointer need
   to specify how that character is to be handled, if it is to be
   useful.

   Any error condition for which a specific action is not defined by the
   JSON Pointer application results in termination of evaluation.

5.  JSON String Representation

   A JSON Pointer can be represented in a JSON string value.  Per
   [RFC4627], Section 2.5, all instances of quotation mark '"' (%x22),
   reverse solidus '\' (%x5C), and control (%x00-1F) characters MUST be
   escaped.

   Note that before processing a JSON string as a JSON Pointer,
   backslash escape sequences must be unescaped.










Bryan, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 4]

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   For example, given the JSON document

   {
      "foo": ["bar", "baz"],
      "": 0,
      "a/b": 1,
      "c%d": 2,
      "e^f": 3,
      "g|h": 4,
      "i\\j": 5,
      "k\"l": 6,
      " ": 7,
      "m~n": 8
   }

   The following JSON strings evaluate to the accompanying values:

    ""           // the whole document
    "/foo"       ["bar", "baz"]
    "/foo/0"     "bar"
    "/"          0
    "/a~1b"      1
    "/c%d"       2
    "/e^f"       3
    "/g|h"       4
    "/i\\j"      5
    "/k\"l"      6
    "/ "         7
    "/m~0n"      8

6.  URI Fragment Identifier Representation

   A JSON Pointer can be represented in a URI fragment identifier by
   encoding it into octets using UTF-8 [RFC3629], while percent-encoding
   those characters not allowed by the fragment rule in [RFC3986].

   Note that a given media type needs to specify JSON Pointer as its
   fragment identifier syntax explicitly (usually, in its registration
   [RFC6838]).  That is, just because a document is JSON does not imply
   that JSON Pointer can be used as its fragment identifier syntax.  In
   particular, the fragment identifier syntax for application/json is
   not JSON Pointer.









Bryan, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 5]

RFC 6901                      JSON Pointer                    April 2013


   Given the same example document as above, the following URI fragment
   identifiers evaluate to the accompanying values:

    #            // the whole document
    #/foo        ["bar", "baz"]
    #/foo/0      "bar"
    #/           0
    #/a~1b       1
    #/c%25d      2
    #/e%5Ef      3
    #/g%7Ch      4
    #/i%5Cj      5
    #/k%22l      6
    #/%20        7
    #/m~0n       8

7.  Error Handling

   In the event of an error condition, evaluation of the JSON Pointer
   fails to complete.

   Error conditions include, but are not limited to:

   o  Invalid pointer syntax

   o  A pointer that references a nonexistent value

   This specification does not define how errors are handled.  An
   application of JSON Pointer SHOULD specify the impact and handling of
   each type of error.

   For example, some applications might stop pointer processing upon an
   error, while others may attempt to recover from missing values by
   inserting default ones.

8.  Security Considerations

   A given JSON Pointer is not guaranteed to reference an actual JSON
   value.  Therefore, applications using JSON Pointer should anticipate
   this situation by defining how a pointer that does not resolve ought
   to be handled.

   Note that JSON pointers can contain the NUL (Unicode U+0000)
   character.  Care is needed not to misinterpret this character in
   programming languages that use NUL to mark the end of a string.

If you are new to authoring then begin with the introduction below or if you are more familiar then the main menu lists multiple individual topics.

If you have been redirected here from tools.ietf.org then that site has been decommissioned.  The features available at that site have been replaced as follows:
- The interactive tools are now at https://author-tools.ietf.org
- The catalog of tools is now at Tools catalog
- The xml2rfc vocabulary documentation is now at RFCXML Vocabulary
- The repositories for the various tools are now in the ietf-tools organisation on GitHub

¶ Introducing Internet-Drafts
Internet-Drafts (I-Ds) are the basic work items of the IETF and they are produced for a variety of purposes by a wide range of individuals and groups. Anyone can write and submit an Internet-Draft.
Some I-Ds may eventually be published as a Request for Comment (RFC).  Each of the RFC Streams has their own process for how an I-D becomes an RFC.  For the IETF that is documented in the standards development process.  When an I-D is approved to become an RFC, it follows the separate RFC Editor RFC publication process.
Unless otherwise indicated, the information on this site applies to all streams.
Internet-Drafts are prepared by people acting in possibly several roles, such as an author or an editor. The term "author" is used here, but the information applies to people acting in any role.
To find out more about authoring an I-D, begin with Getting started.

For the IETF that is documented in the standards development process.  When an I-D is approved to become an RFC, it follows the separate RFC Editor RFC publication process.
Unless otherwise indicated, the information on this site applies to all streams.
Internet-Drafts are prepared by people acting in possibly several roles, such as an author or an editor. The term "author" is used here, but the information applies to people acting in any role.
To find out more about authoring an I-D, begin with Getting started.

This site is the central resource site for authors of an Internet-Draft (I-D), with information on how to write an I-D and the tools available to support this. If you are new to authoring then begin with the introduction below or if you are more familiar then the main menu lists multiple individual topics.

If you have been redirected here from tools.ietf.org then that site has been decommissioned.  The features available at that site have been replaced as follows:
- The interactive tools are now at https://author-tools.ietf.org
- The catalog of tools is now at Tools catalog
- The xml2rfc vocabulary documentation is now at RFCXML Vocabulary
- The repositories for the various tools are now in the ietf-tools organisation on GitHub

¶ Introducing Internet-Drafts
Internet-Drafts (I-Ds) are the basic work items of the IETF and they are produced for a variety of purposes by a wide range of individuals and groups. Anyone can write and submit an Internet-Draft.
Some I-Ds may eventually be published as a Request for Comment (RFC).  Each of the RFC Streams has their own process for how an I-D becomes an RFC.  For the IETF that is documented in the standards development process.  When an I-D is approved to become an RFC, it follows the separate RFC Editor RFC publication process.
Unless otherwise indicated, the information on this site applies to all streams.
Internet-Drafts are prepared by people acting in possibly several roles, such as an author or an editor. The term "author" is used here, but the information applies to people acting in any role.
To find out more about authoring an I-D, begin with Getting started.

            Final
            Charter for
            
            Working Group
        
        The Applications Area sometimes receives proposals for the development
  of specifications dealing with application-related topics that are not
  in scope for an existing working group and do not justify the formation
  of a new working group.
The Applications Area Working Group (APPSAWG) can serve as a forum for such
  work in the IETF. The APPSAWG accepts work items in accordance with the
  consensus of the Working Group and the best judgment of the Applications
  Area
  Directors, who are responsible for updating the working group milestones
  as needed. The working group meets if there are active proposals that
  require intensive discussion.
Work items that are appropriate for the APPSAWG mostly fall under the
  following topics:
(A) Well-defined security issues that are relevant to multiple
  application technologies (e.g., draft-saintandre-tls-server-id-check).
(B) Small-scale additions to the protocol stack for HTTP and other
  application technologies, mostly related to service discovery and
  meta-data (e.g., RFC 5785, draft-nottingham-http-link-header, and
  draft-hammer-hostmeta).
(C) Selected other work items addressing topics that historically fall
  within the Applications Area, such as calendaring, date and time
  formats, HTTP, internationalization, language tags, MIME, URIs and XML.
When considering whether to accept a proposed work item, the APPSAWG and
  the Applications Area Directors shall take into account the following
  factors, among others:


There is no existing related Working Group that is willing to recharter
  to take on this work, and the document doesn't justify the formation
  of a new working group.


Whether the WG has consensus on the suitability, importance, and
  projected quality of the proposed work item.


Whether there is a core team of WG participants with sufficient energy
  and expertise to advance the proposed work item according to the proposed
  schedule.


Whether there are enough WG participants who are willing to review
  the work produced by the document authors or editors.


Whether the Area Directors judge that wider input is needed before
  accepting the proposed work item (e.g., from the IESG, IAB, or another
  standards development organization).

            Final
            Charter for
            
            Working Group
        
        The Applications Area sometimes receives proposals for the development
  of specifications dealing with application-related topics that are not
  in scope for an existing working group and do not justify the formation
  of a new working group.
The Applications Area Working Group (APPSAWG) can serve as a forum for such
  work in the IETF. The APPSAWG accepts work items in accordance with the
  consensus of the Working Group and the best judgment of the Applications
  Area
  Directors, who are responsible for updating the working group milestones
  as needed. The working group meets if there are active proposals that
  require intensive discussion.
Work items that are appropriate for the APPSAWG mostly fall under the
  following topics:
(A) Well-defined security issues that are relevant to multiple
  application technologies (e.g., draft-saintandre-tls-server-id-check).
(B) Small-scale additions to the protocol stack for HTTP and other
  application technologies, mostly related to service discovery and
  meta-data (e.g., RFC 5785, draft-nottingham-http-link-header, and
  draft-hammer-hostmeta).
(C) Selected other work items addressing topics that historically fall
  within the Applications Area, such as calendaring, date and time
  formats, HTTP, internationalization, language tags, MIME, URIs and XML.
When considering whether to accept a proposed work item, the APPSAWG and
  the Applications Area Directors shall take into account the following
  factors, among others:


There is no existing related Working Group that is willing to recharter
  to take on this work, and the document doesn't justify the formation
  of a new working group.


Whether the WG has consensus on the suitability, importance, and
  projected quality of the proposed work item.


Whether there is a core team of WG participants with sufficient energy
  and expertise to advance the proposed work item according to the proposed
  schedule.


Whether there are enough WG participants who are willing to review
  the work produced by the document authors or editors.


Whether the Area Directors judge that wider input is needed before
  accepting the proposed work item (e.g., from the IESG, IAB, or another
  standards development organization).

            Final
            Charter for
            
            Working Group
        
        The Applications Area sometimes receives proposals for the development
  of specifications dealing with application-related topics that are not
  in scope for an existing working group and do not justify the formation
  of a new working group.
The Applications Area Working Group (APPSAWG) can serve as a forum for such
  work in the IETF. The APPSAWG accepts work items in accordance with the
  consensus of the Working Group and the best judgment of the Applications
  Area
  Directors, who are responsible for updating the working group milestones
  as needed. The working group meets if there are active proposals that
  require intensive discussion.
Work items that are appropriate for the APPSAWG mostly fall under the
  following topics:
(A) Well-defined security issues that are relevant to multiple
  application technologies (e.g., draft-saintandre-tls-server-id-check).
(B) Small-scale additions to the protocol stack for HTTP and other
  application technologies, mostly related to service discovery and
  meta-data (e.g., RFC 5785, draft-nottingham-http-link-header, and
  draft-hammer-hostmeta).
(C) Selected other work items addressing topics that historically fall
  within the Applications Area, such as calendaring, date and time
  formats, HTTP, internationalization, language tags, MIME, URIs and XML.
When considering whether to accept a proposed work item, the APPSAWG and
  the Applications Area Directors shall take into account the following
  factors, among others:


There is no existing related Working Group that is willing to recharter
  to take on this work, and the document doesn't justify the formation
  of a new working group.


Whether the WG has consensus on the suitability, importance, and
  projected quality of the proposed work item.


Whether there is a core team of WG participants with sufficient energy
  and expertise to advance the proposed work item according to the proposed
  schedule.


Whether there are enough WG participants who are willing to review
  the work produced by the document authors or editors.


Whether the Area Directors judge that wider input is needed before
  accepting the proposed work item (e.g., from the IESG, IAB, or another
  standards development organization).

This site is the central resource site for authors of an Internet-Draft (I-D), with information on how to write an I-D and the tools available to support this. If you are new to authoring then begin with the introduction below or if you are more familiar then the main menu lists multiple individual topics.

If you have been redirected here from tools.ietf.org then that site has been decommissioned.  The features available at that site have been replaced as follows:
- The interactive tools are now at https://author-tools.ietf.org
- The catalog of tools is now at Tools catalog
- The xml2rfc vocabulary documentation is now at RFCXML Vocabulary
- The repositories for the various tools are now in the ietf-tools organisation on GitHub

¶ Introducing Internet-Drafts
Internet-Drafts (I-Ds) are the basic work items of the IETF and they are produced for a variety of purposes by a wide range of individuals and groups. Anyone can write and submit an Internet-Draft.
Some I-Ds may eventually be published as a Request for Comment (RFC).  Each of the RFC Streams has their own process for how an I-D becomes an RFC.  For the IETF that is documented in the standards development process.  When an I-D is approved to become an RFC, it follows the separate RFC Editor RFC publication process.
Unless otherwise indicated, the information on this site applies to all streams.
Internet-Drafts are prepared by people acting in possibly several roles, such as an author or an editor. The term "author" is used here, but the information applies to people acting in any role.
To find out more about authoring an I-D, begin with Getting started.

            Final
            Charter for
            
            Working Group
        
        The Applications Area sometimes receives proposals for the development
  of specifications dealing with application-related topics that are not
  in scope for an existing working group and do not justify the formation
  of a new working group.
The Applications Area Working Group (APPSAWG) can serve as a forum for such
  work in the IETF. The APPSAWG accepts work items in accordance with the
  consensus of the Working Group and the best judgment of the Applications
  Area
  Directors, who are responsible for updating the working group milestones
  as needed. The working group meets if there are active proposals that
  require intensive discussion.
Work items that are appropriate for the APPSAWG mostly fall under the
  following topics:
(A) Well-defined security issues that are relevant to multiple
  application technologies (e.g., draft-saintandre-tls-server-id-check).
(B) Small-scale additions to the protocol stack for HTTP and other
  application technologies, mostly related to service discovery and
  meta-data (e.g., RFC 5785, draft-nottingham-http-link-header, and
  draft-hammer-hostmeta).
(C) Selected other work items addressing topics that historically fall
  within the Applications Area, such as calendaring, date and time
  formats, HTTP, internationalization, language tags, MIME, URIs and XML.
When considering whether to accept a proposed work item, the APPSAWG and
  the Applications Area Directors shall take into account the following
  factors, among others:


There is no existing related Working Group that is willing to recharter
  to take on this work, and the document doesn't justify the formation
  of a new working group.


Whether the WG has consensus on the suitability, importance, and
  projected quality of the proposed work item.


Whether there is a core team of WG participants with sufficient energy
  and expertise to advance the proposed work item according to the proposed
  schedule.


Whether there are enough WG participants who are willing to review
  the work produced by the document authors or editors.


Whether the Area Directors judge that wider input is needed before
  accepting the proposed work item (e.g., from the IESG, IAB, or another
  standards development organization).

            Final
            Charter for
            
            Working Group
        
        The Applications Area sometimes receives proposals for the development
  of specifications dealing with application-related topics that are not
  in scope for an existing working group and do not justify the formation
  of a new working group.
The Applications Area Working Group (APPSAWG) can serve as a forum for such
  work in the IETF. The APPSAWG accepts work items in accordance with the
  consensus of the Working Group and the best judgment of the Applications
  Area
  Directors, who are responsible for updating the working group milestones
  as needed. The working group meets if there are active proposals that
  require intensive discussion.
Work items that are appropriate for the APPSAWG mostly fall under the
  following topics:
(A) Well-defined security issues that are relevant to multiple
  application technologies (e.g., draft-saintandre-tls-server-id-check).
(B) Small-scale additions to the protocol stack for HTTP and other
  application technologies, mostly related to service discovery and
  meta-data (e.g., RFC 5785, draft-nottingham-http-link-header, and
  draft-hammer-hostmeta).
(C) Selected other work items addressing topics that historically fall
  within the Applications Area, such as calendaring, date and time
  formats, HTTP, internationalization, language tags, MIME, URIs and XML.
When considering whether to accept a proposed work item, the APPSAWG and
  the Applications Area Directors shall take into account the following
  factors, among others:


There is no existing related Working Group that is willing to recharter
  to take on this work, and the document doesn't justify the formation
  of a new working group.


Whether the WG has consensus on the suitability, importance, and
  projected quality of the proposed work item.


Whether there is a core team of WG participants with sufficient energy
  and expertise to advance the proposed work item according to the proposed
  schedule.


Whether there are enough WG participants who are willing to review
  the work produced by the document authors or editors.


Whether the Area Directors judge that wider input is needed before
  accepting the proposed work item (e.g., from the IESG, IAB, or another
  standards development organization).

            Final
            Charter for
            
            Working Group
        
        The Applications Area sometimes receives proposals for the development
  of specifications dealing with application-related topics that are not
  in scope for an existing working group and do not justify the formation
  of a new working group.
The Applications Area Working Group (APPSAWG) can serve as a forum for such
  work in the IETF. The APPSAWG accepts work items in accordance with the
  consensus of the Working Group and the best judgment of the Applications
  Area
  Directors, who are responsible for updating the working group milestones
  as needed. The working group meets if there are active proposals that
  require intensive discussion.
Work items that are appropriate for the APPSAWG mostly fall under the
  following topics:
(A) Well-defined security issues that are relevant to multiple
  application technologies (e.g., draft-saintandre-tls-server-id-check).
(B) Small-scale additions to the protocol stack for HTTP and other
  application technologies, mostly related to service discovery and
  meta-data (e.g., RFC 5785, draft-nottingham-http-link-header, and
  draft-hammer-hostmeta).
(C) Selected other work items addressing topics that historically fall
  within the Applications Area, such as calendaring, date and time
  formats, HTTP, internationalization, language tags, MIME, URIs and XML.
When considering whether to accept a proposed work item, the APPSAWG and
  the Applications Area Directors shall take into account the following
  factors, among others:


There is no existing related Working Group that is willing to recharter
  to take on this work, and the document doesn't justify the formation
  of a new working group.


Whether the WG has consensus on the suitability, importance, and
  projected quality of the proposed work item.


Whether there is a core team of WG participants with sufficient energy
  and expertise to advance the proposed work item according to the proposed
  schedule.


Whether there are enough WG participants who are willing to review
  the work produced by the document authors or editors.


Whether the Area Directors judge that wider input is needed before
  accepting the proposed work item (e.g., from the IESG, IAB, or another
  standards development organization).

This site is the central resource site for authors of an Internet-Draft (I-D), with information on how to write an I-D and the tools available to support this. If you are new to authoring then begin with the introduction below or if you are more familiar then the main menu lists multiple individual topics.

If you have been redirected here from tools.ietf.org then that site has been decommissioned.  The features available at that site have been replaced as follows:
- The interactive tools are now at https://author-tools.ietf.org
- The catalog of tools is now at Tools catalog
- The xml2rfc vocabulary documentation is now at RFCXML Vocabulary
- The repositories for the various tools are now in the ietf-tools organisation on GitHub

¶ Introducing Internet-Drafts
Internet-Drafts (I-Ds) are the basic work items of the IETF and they are produced for a variety of purposes by a wide range of individuals and groups. Anyone can write and submit an Internet-Draft.
Some I-Ds may eventually be published as a Request for Comment (RFC).  Each of the RFC Streams has their own process for how an I-D becomes an RFC.  For the IETF that is documented in the standards development process.  When an I-D is approved to become an RFC, it follows the separate RFC Editor RFC publication process.
Unless otherwise indicated, the information on this site applies to all streams.
Internet-Drafts are prepared by people acting in possibly several roles, such as an author or an editor. The term "author" is used here, but the information applies to people acting in any role.
To find out more about authoring an I-D, begin with Getting started.

This site is the central resource site for authors of an Internet-Draft (I-D), with information on how to write an I-D and the tools available to support this. If you are new to authoring then begin with the introduction below or if you are more familiar then the main menu lists multiple individual topics.

If you have been redirected here from tools.ietf.org then that site has been decommissioned.  The features available at that site have been replaced as follows:
- The interactive tools are now at https://author-tools.ietf.org
- The catalog of tools is now at Tools catalog
- The xml2rfc vocabulary documentation is now at RFCXML Vocabulary
- The repositories for the various tools are now in the ietf-tools organisation on GitHub

¶ Introducing Internet-Drafts
Internet-Drafts (I-Ds) are the basic work items of the IETF and they are produced for a variety of purposes by a wide range of individuals and groups. Anyone can write and submit an Internet-Draft.
Some I-Ds may eventually be published as a Request for Comment (RFC).  Each of the RFC Streams has their own process for how an I-D becomes an RFC.  For the IETF that is documented in the standards development process.  When an I-D is approved to become an RFC, it follows the separate RFC Editor RFC publication process.
Unless otherwise indicated, the information on this site applies to all streams.
Internet-Drafts are prepared by people acting in possibly several roles, such as an author or an editor. The term "author" is used here, but the information applies to people acting in any role.
To find out more about authoring an I-D, begin with Getting started.

This site is the central resource site for authors of an Internet-Draft (I-D), with information on how to write an I-D and the tools available to support this. If you are new to authoring then begin with the introduction below or if you are more familiar then the main menu lists multiple individual topics.

If you have been redirected here from tools.ietf.org then that site has been decommissioned.  The features available at that site have been replaced as follows:
- The interactive tools are now at https://author-tools.ietf.org
- The catalog of tools is now at Tools catalog
- The xml2rfc vocabulary documentation is now at RFCXML Vocabulary
- The repositories for the various tools are now in the ietf-tools organisation on GitHub

¶ Introducing Internet-Drafts
Internet-Drafts (I-Ds) are the basic work items of the IETF and they are produced for a variety of purposes by a wide range of individuals and groups. Anyone can write and submit an Internet-Draft.
Some I-Ds may eventually be published as a Request for Comment (RFC).  Each of the RFC Streams has their own process for how an I-D becomes an RFC.  For the IETF that is documented in the standards development process.  When an I-D is approved to become an RFC, it follows the separate RFC Editor RFC publication process.
Unless otherwise indicated, the information on this site applies to all streams.
Internet-Drafts are prepared by people acting in possibly several roles, such as an author or an editor. The term "author" is used here, but the information applies to people acting in any role.
To find out more about authoring an I-D, begin with Getting started.

This site is the central resource site for authors of an Internet-Draft (I-D), with information on how to write an I-D and the tools available to support this. If you are new to authoring then begin with the introduction below or if you are more familiar then the main menu lists multiple individual topics.

If you have been redirected here from tools.ietf.org then that site has been decommissioned.  The features available at that site have been replaced as follows:
- The interactive tools are now at https://author-tools.ietf.org
- The catalog of tools is now at Tools catalog
- The xml2rfc vocabulary documentation is now at RFCXML Vocabulary
- The repositories for the various tools are now in the ietf-tools organisation on GitHub

¶ Introducing Internet-Drafts
Internet-Drafts (I-Ds) are the basic work items of the IETF and they are produced for a variety of purposes by a wide range of individuals and groups. Anyone can write and submit an Internet-Draft.
Some I-Ds may eventually be published as a Request for Comment (RFC).  Each of the RFC Streams has their own process for how an I-D becomes an RFC.

This site is the central resource site for authors of an Internet-Draft (I-D), with information on how to write an I-D and the tools available to support this. If you are new to authoring then begin with the introduction below or if you are more familiar then the main menu lists multiple individual topics.

If you have been redirected here from tools.ietf.org then that site has been decommissioned.  The features available at that site have been replaced as follows:
- The interactive tools are now at https://author-tools.ietf.org
- The catalog of tools is now at Tools catalog
- The xml2rfc vocabulary documentation is now at RFCXML Vocabulary
- The repositories for the various tools are now in the ietf-tools organisation on GitHub

¶ Introducing Internet-Drafts
Internet-Drafts (I-Ds) are the basic work items of the IETF and they are produced for a variety of purposes by a wide range of individuals and groups. Anyone can write and submit an Internet-Draft.
Some I-Ds may eventually be published as a Request for Comment (RFC).  Each of the RFC Streams has their own process for how an I-D becomes an RFC.  For the IETF that is documented in the standards development process.  When an I-D is approved to become an RFC, it follows the separate RFC Editor RFC publication process.
Unless otherwise indicated, the information on this site applies to all streams.
Internet-Drafts are prepared by people acting in possibly several roles, such as an author or an editor. The term "author" is used here, but the information applies to people acting in any role.

Internet-Drafts (I-Ds) are the basic work items of the IETF and they are produced for a variety of purposes by a wide range of individuals and groups. Anyone can write and submit an Internet-Draft.
Some I-Ds may eventually be published as a Request for Comment (RFC).  Each of the RFC Streams has their own process for how an I-D becomes an RFC.  For the IETF that is documented in the standards development process.  When an I-D is approved to become an RFC, it follows the separate RFC Editor RFC publication process.
Unless otherwise indicated, the information on this site applies to all streams.
Internet-Drafts are prepared by people acting in possibly several roles, such as an author or an editor. The term "author" is used here, but the information applies to people acting in any role.
To find out more about authoring an I-D, begin with Getting started.

This site is the central resource site for authors of an Internet-Draft (I-D), with information on how to write an I-D and the tools available to support this. If you are new to authoring then begin with the introduction below or if you are more familiar then the main menu lists multiple individual topics.

If you have been redirected here from tools.ietf.org then that site has been decommissioned.  The features available at that site have been replaced as follows:
- The interactive tools are now at https://author-tools.ietf.org
- The catalog of tools is now at Tools catalog
- The xml2rfc vocabulary documentation is now at RFCXML Vocabulary
- The repositories for the various tools are now in the ietf-tools organisation on GitHub

¶ Introducing Internet-Drafts
Internet-Drafts (I-Ds) are the basic work items of the IETF and they are produced for a variety of purposes by a wide range of individuals and groups. Anyone can write and submit an Internet-Draft.
Some I-Ds may eventually be published as a Request for Comment (RFC).  Each of the RFC Streams has their own process for how an I-D becomes an RFC.  For the IETF that is documented in the standards development process.  When an I-D is approved to become an RFC, it follows the separate RFC Editor RFC publication process.
Unless otherwise indicated, the information on this site applies to all streams.
Internet-Drafts are prepared by people acting in possibly several roles, such as an author or an editor. The term "author" is used here, but the information applies to people acting in any role.
To find out more about authoring an I-D, begin with Getting started.

Some I-Ds may eventually be published as a Request for Comment (RFC).  Each of the RFC Streams has their own process for how an I-D becomes an RFC.  For the IETF that is documented in the standards development process.  When an I-D is approved to become an RFC, it follows the separate RFC Editor RFC publication process.
Unless otherwise indicated, the information on this site applies to all streams.
Internet-Drafts are prepared by people acting in possibly several roles, such as an author or an editor. The term "author" is used here, but the information applies to people acting in any role.
To find out more about authoring an I-D, begin with Getting started.
