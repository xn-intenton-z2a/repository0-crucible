# NODE_ESM

## Crawl Summary
The crawled content covers Node.js ECMAScript Modules documentation including API specifications, configuration options, and code examples. It details module resolution, enabling ESM, import attributes, dynamic imports, and differences with CommonJS. Historical version updates and error handling are also covered.

## Normalised Extract
## Summary
This extract encapsulates key details on Node.js ECMAScript Modules, outlining implementation patterns, module resolution strategies, and code usage examples.

## Table of Contents
1. Introduction
2. Enabling ESM
3. Import & Resolution
4. Interoperability

### 1. Introduction
Node.js ESM is the standard format for packaging JavaScript. It defines modules using import/export syntax with examples of function exports and dynamic imports.

### 2. Enabling ESM
Modules are designated via .mjs files, package.json "type": "module", or command-line flags. This section explains transformation from CommonJS to ESM.

### 3. Import & Resolution
Detailed explanation of import specifiers, URL resolution, file extensions, and the Node.js specific module resolution algorithm including error handling for invalid modules.

### 4. Interoperability
Discussion on differences between ES modules and CommonJS modules, providing code samples and interoperability guidelines for smooth module exchange.


## Supplementary Details
Recent updates confirm that import attributes are stable, with improvements in module caching and resolution. The Node.js community continuously enhances interoperability between module systems by optimizing real-time error tracking and performance hooks.

## Reference Details
The documentation details API specifications such as the use of import(), import.meta properties (dirname, filename, url), and dynamic import patterns. It includes SDK method signatures like module.createRequire(), error handling for unsupported module extensions, and best practices for using JSON and WASM modules. Code examples are provided to illustrate synchronous module loading, file URL conversions, conditional environment handling, and troubleshooting instructions for misconfigured module resolutions. The resilience of the module system is ensured by robust error propagation during resolution and strict guidelines for package exports and imports.
