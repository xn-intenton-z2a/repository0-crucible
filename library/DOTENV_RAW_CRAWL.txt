dotenv 

Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology.

üå± Install
npm install dotenv --save
You can also use an npm-compatible package manager like yarn or bun:
yarn add dotenv
# or
bun add dotenv
üèóÔ∏è Usage






Create a .env file in the root of your project (if using a monorepo structure like apps/backend/app.js, put it in the root of the folder where your app.js process runs):
S3_BUCKET="YOURS3BUCKET"
SECRET_KEY="YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE"
As early as possible in your application, import and configure dotenv:
require('dotenv').config()
console.log(process.env) // remove this after you've confirmed it is working
.. or using ES6?
import 'dotenv/config'
That's it. process.env now has the keys and values you defined in your .env file:
require('dotenv').config()
// or import 'dotenv/config' if you're using ES6

...

s3.getBucketCors({Bucket: process.env.S3_BUCKET}, function(err, data) {})
Multiline values
If you need multiline variables, for example private keys, those are now supported (>= v15.0.0) with line breaks:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
...
Kh9NV...
...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
Alternatively, you can double quote strings and use the \n character:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nKh9NV...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
Comments
Comments may be added to your file on their own line or inline:
# This is a comment
SECRET_KEY=YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE # comment
SECRET_HASH="something-with-a-#-hash"
Comments begin where a # exists, so if your value contains a # please wrap it in quotes. This is a breaking change from >= v15.0.0 and on.
Parsing
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Preload

Note: Consider using dotenvx instead of preloading. I am now doing (and recommending) so.
It serves the same purpose (you do not need to require and load dotenv), adds better debugging, and works with ANY language, framework, or platform. ‚Äì motdotla

You can use the --require (-r) command line option to preload dotenv. By doing this, you do not need to require and load dotenv in your application code.
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
The configuration options below are supported as command line arguments in the format dotenv_config_<option>=value
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env dotenv_config_debug=true
Additionally, you can use environment variables to set configuration options. Command line arguments will precede these.
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_<OPTION>=value node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_ENCODING=latin1 DOTENV_CONFIG_DEBUG=true node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env
Variable Expansion
You need to add the value of another variable in one of your variables? Use dotenv-expand.
Command Substitution
Use dotenvx to use command substitution.
Add the output of a command to one of your variables in your .env file.
# .env
DATABASE_URL="postgres://$(whoami)@localhost/my_database"
// index.js
console.log('DATABASE_URL', process.env.DATABASE_URL)
$ dotenvx run --debug -- node index.js
[dotenvx@0.14.1] injecting env (1) from .env
DATABASE_URL postgres://yourusername@localhost/my_database
Syncing
You need to keep .env files in sync between machines, environments, or team members? Use dotenvx to encrypt your .env files and safely include them in source control. This still subscribes to the twelve-factor app rules by generating a decryption key separate from code.
Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx to generate .env.ci, .env.production files, and more.
Deploying
You need to deploy your secrets in a cloud-agnostic manner? Use dotenvx to generate a private decryption key that is set on your production server.
üå¥ Manage Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx
Run any environment locally. Create a .env.ENVIRONMENT file and use --env-file to load it. It's straightforward, yet flexible.
$ echo "HELLO=production" > .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.production -- node index.js
Hello production
> ^^
or with multiple .env files
$ echo "HELLO=local" > .env.local
$ echo "HELLO=World" > .env
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.local --env-file=.env -- node index.js
Hello local
more environment examples
üöÄ Deploying
Use dotenvx.
Add encryption to your .env files with a single command. Pass the --encrypt flag.
$ dotenvx set HELLO Production --encrypt -f .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION="<.env.production private key>" dotenvx run -- node index.js
[dotenvx] injecting env (2) from .env.production
Hello Production

üìñ Documentation
Dotenv exposes four functions:

config
parse
populate
decrypt

Config
config will read your .env file, parse the contents, assign it to
process.env,
and return an Object with a parsed key containing the loaded content or an error key if it failed.
const result = dotenv.config()

if (result.error) {
  throw result.error
}

console.log(result.parsed)
You can additionally, pass options to config.
Options
path
Default: path.resolve(process.cwd(), '.env')
Specify a custom path if your file containing environment variables is located elsewhere.
require('dotenv').config({ path: '/custom/path/to/.env' })
By default, config will look for a file called .env in the current working directory.
Pass in multiple files as an array, and they will be parsed in order and combined with process.env (or option.processEnv, if set). The first value set for a variable will win, unless the options.override flag is set, in which case the last value set will win.  If a value already exists in process.env and the options.override flag is NOT set, no changes will be made to that value.
require('dotenv').config({ path: ['.env.local', '.env'] })
encoding
Default: utf8
Specify the encoding of your file containing environment variables.
require('dotenv').config({ encoding: 'latin1' })
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
require('dotenv').config({ debug: process.env.DEBUG })
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set on your machine with values from your .env file(s). If multiple files have been provided in option.path the override will also be used as each file is combined with the next. Without override being set, the first value wins. With override set the last value wins.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
processEnv
Default: process.env
Specify an object to write your environment variables to. Defaults to process.env environment variables.
const myObject = {}
require('dotenv').config({ processEnv: myObject })

console.log(myObject) // values from .env
console.log(process.env) // this was not changed or written to
Parse
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment
variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return
an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Options
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('hello world')
const opt = { debug: true }
const config = dotenv.parse(buf, opt)
// expect a debug message because the buffer is not in KEY=VAL form
Populate
The engine which populates the contents of your .env file to process.env is available for use. It accepts a target, a source, and options. This is useful for power users who want to supply their own objects.
For example, customizing the source:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'world' }

dotenv.populate(process.env, parsed)

console.log(process.env.HELLO) // world
For example, customizing the source AND target:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'universe' }
const target = { HELLO: 'world' } // empty object

dotenv.populate(target, parsed, { override: true, debug: true })

console.log(target) // { HELLO: 'universe' }
options
Debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being populated as you expect.
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set.
‚ùì FAQ
Why is the .env file not loading my environment variables successfully?
Most likely your .env file is not in the correct place. See this stack overflow.
Turn on debug mode and try again..
require('dotenv').config({ debug: true })
You will receive a helpful error outputted to your console.
Should I commit my .env file?
No. We strongly recommend against committing your .env file to version
control. It should only include environment-specific values such as database
passwords or API keys. Your production database should have a different
password than your development database.
Should I have multiple .env files?
We recommend creating one .env file per environment. Use .env for local/development, .env.production for production and so on. This still follows the twelve factor principles as each is attributed individually to its own environment. Avoid custom set ups that work in inheritance somehow (.env.production inherits values form .env for example). It is better to duplicate values if necessary across each .env.environment file.

In a twelve-factor app, env vars are granular controls, each fully orthogonal to other env vars. They are never grouped together as ‚Äúenvironments‚Äù, but instead are independently managed for each deploy. This is a model that scales up smoothly as the app naturally expands into more deploys over its lifetime.
‚Äì The Twelve-Factor App

What rules does the parsing engine follow?
The parsing engine currently supports the following rules:

BASIC=basic becomes {BASIC: 'basic'}
empty lines are skipped
lines beginning with # are treated as comments
# marks the beginning of a comment (unless when the value is wrapped in quotes)
empty values become empty strings (EMPTY= becomes {EMPTY: ''})
inner quotes are maintained (think JSON) (JSON={"foo": "bar"} becomes {JSON:"{\"foo\": \"bar\"}")
whitespace is removed from both ends of unquoted values (see more on trim) (FOO=  some value   becomes {FOO: 'some value'})
single and double quoted values are escaped (SINGLE_QUOTE='quoted' becomes {SINGLE_QUOTE: "quoted"})
single and double quoted values maintain whitespace from both ends (FOO="  some value  " becomes {FOO: '  some value  '})
double quoted values expand new lines (MULTILINE="new\nline" becomes

{MULTILINE: 'new
line'}


backticks are supported (BACKTICK_KEY=`This has 'single' and "double" quotes inside of it.`)

What happens to environment variables that were already set?
By default, we will never modify any environment variables that have already been set. In particular, if there is a variable in your .env file which collides with one that already exists in your environment, then that variable will be skipped.
If instead, you want to override process.env use the override option.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
How come my environment variables are not showing up for React?
Your React code is run in Webpack, where the fs module or even the process global itself are not accessible out-of-the-box. process.env can only be injected through Webpack configuration.
If you are using react-scripts, which is distributed through create-react-app, it has dotenv built in but with a quirk. Preface your environment variables with REACT_APP_. See this stack overflow for more details.
If you are using other frameworks (e.g. Next.js, Gatsby...), you need to consult their documentation for how to inject environment variables into the client.
Can I customize/write plugins for dotenv?
Yes! dotenv.config() returns an object representing the parsed .env file. This gives you everything you need to continue setting values on process.env. For example:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const variableExpansion = require('dotenv-expand')
const myEnv = dotenv.config()
variableExpansion(myEnv)
How do I use dotenv with import?
Simply..
// index.mjs (ESM)
import 'dotenv/config' // see https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#how-do-i-use-dotenv-with-import
import express from 'express'
A little background..

When you run a module containing an import declaration, the modules it imports are loaded first, then each module body is executed in a depth-first traversal of the dependency graph, avoiding cycles by skipping anything already executed.
‚Äì ES6 In Depth: Modules

What does this mean in plain language? It means you would think the following would work but it won't.
errorReporter.mjs:
class Client {
  constructor (apiKey) {
    console.log('apiKey', apiKey)

    this.apiKey = apiKey
  }
}

export default new Client(process.env.API_KEY)
index.mjs:
// Note: this is INCORRECT and will not work
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv'
dotenv.config()

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs' // process.env.API_KEY will be blank!
process.env.API_KEY will be blank.
Instead, index.mjs should be written as..
import 'dotenv/config'

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs'
Does that make sense? It's a bit unintuitive, but it is how importing of ES6 modules work. Here is a working example of this pitfall.
There are two alternatives to this approach:

Preload dotenv: node --require dotenv/config index.js (Note: you do not need to import dotenv with this approach)
Create a separate file that will execute config first as outlined in this comment on #133

Why am I getting the error Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'crypto|os|path'?
You are using dotenv on the front-end and have not included a polyfill. Webpack < 5 used to include these for you. Do the following:
npm install node-polyfill-webpack-plugin
Configure your webpack.config.js to something like the following.
require('dotenv').config()

const path = require('path');
const webpack = require('webpack')

const NodePolyfillPlugin = require('node-polyfill-webpack-plugin')

module.exports = {
  mode: 'development',
  entry: './src/index.ts',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  plugins: [
    new NodePolyfillPlugin(),
    new webpack.DefinePlugin({
      'process.env': {
        HELLO: JSON.stringify(process.env.HELLO)
      }
    }),
  ]
};
Alternatively, just use dotenv-webpack which does this and more behind the scenes for you.
What about variable expansion?
Try dotenv-expand
What about syncing and securing .env files?
Use dotenvx
What if I accidentally commit my .env file to code?
Remove it, remove git history and then install the git pre-commit hook to prevent this from ever happening again.
brew install dotenvx/brew/dotenvx
dotenvx precommit --install

How can I prevent committing my .env file to a Docker build?
Use the docker prebuild hook.
# Dockerfile
...
RUN curl -fsS https://dotenvx.sh/ | sh
...
RUN dotenvx prebuild
CMD ["dotenvx", "run", "--", "node", "index.js"]

üèóÔ∏è Usage






Create a .env file in the root of your project (if using a monorepo structure like apps/backend/app.js, put it in the root of the folder where your app.js process runs):
S3_BUCKET="YOURS3BUCKET"
SECRET_KEY="YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE"
As early as possible in your application, import and configure dotenv:
require('dotenv').config()
console.log(process.env) // remove this after you've confirmed it is working
.. or using ES6?
import 'dotenv/config'
That's it. process.env now has the keys and values you defined in your .env file:
require('dotenv').config()
// or import 'dotenv/config' if you're using ES6

...

s3.getBucketCors({Bucket: process.env.S3_BUCKET}, function(err, data) {})
Multiline values
If you need multiline variables, for example private keys, those are now supported (>= v15.0.0) with line breaks:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
...
Kh9NV...
...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
Alternatively, you can double quote strings and use the \n character:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nKh9NV...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
Comments
Comments may be added to your file on their own line or inline:
# This is a comment
SECRET_KEY=YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE # comment
SECRET_HASH="something-with-a-#-hash"
Comments begin where a # exists, so if your value contains a # please wrap it in quotes. This is a breaking change from >= v15.0.0 and on.
Parsing
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Preload

Note: Consider using dotenvx instead of preloading. I am now doing (and recommending) so.
It serves the same purpose (you do not need to require and load dotenv), adds better debugging, and works with ANY language, framework, or platform. ‚Äì motdotla

You can use the --require (-r) command line option to preload dotenv. By doing this, you do not need to require and load dotenv in your application code.
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
The configuration options below are supported as command line arguments in the format dotenv_config_<option>=value
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env dotenv_config_debug=true
Additionally, you can use environment variables to set configuration options. Command line arguments will precede these.
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_<OPTION>=value node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_ENCODING=latin1 DOTENV_CONFIG_DEBUG=true node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env
Variable Expansion
You need to add the value of another variable in one of your variables? Use dotenv-expand.
Command Substitution
Use dotenvx to use command substitution.
Add the output of a command to one of your variables in your .env file.
# .env

$ dotenvx run --debug -- node index.js
[dotenvx@0.14.1] injecting env (1) from .env

üìñ Documentation
Dotenv exposes four functions:

config
parse
populate
decrypt

Config
config will read your .env file, parse the contents, assign it to
process.env,
and return an Object with a parsed key containing the loaded content or an error key if it failed.
const result = dotenv.config()

if (result.error) {
  throw result.error
}

console.log(result.parsed)
You can additionally, pass options to config.
Options
path
Default: path.resolve(process.cwd(), '.env')
Specify a custom path if your file containing environment variables is located elsewhere.
require('dotenv').config({ path: '/custom/path/to/.env' })
By default, config will look for a file called .env in the current working directory.
Pass in multiple files as an array, and they will be parsed in order and combined with process.env (or option.processEnv, if set). The first value set for a variable will win, unless the options.override flag is set, in which case the last value set will win.  If a value already exists in process.env and the options.override flag is NOT set, no changes will be made to that value.
require('dotenv').config({ path: ['.env.local', '.env'] })
encoding
Default: utf8
Specify the encoding of your file containing environment variables.
require('dotenv').config({ encoding: 'latin1' })
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
require('dotenv').config({ debug: process.env.DEBUG })
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set on your machine with values from your .env file(s). If multiple files have been provided in option.path the override will also be used as each file is combined with the next. Without override being set, the first value wins. With override set the last value wins.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
processEnv
Default: process.env
Specify an object to write your environment variables to. Defaults to process.env environment variables.
const myObject = {}
require('dotenv').config({ processEnv: myObject })

console.log(myObject) // values from .env
console.log(process.env) // this was not changed or written to
Parse
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment
variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return
an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Options
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('hello world')
const opt = { debug: true }
const config = dotenv.parse(buf, opt)
// expect a debug message because the buffer is not in KEY=VAL form
Populate
The engine which populates the contents of your .env file to process.env is available for use. It accepts a target, a source, and options. This is useful for power users who want to supply their own objects.
For example, customizing the source:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'world' }

dotenv.populate(process.env, parsed)

console.log(process.env.HELLO) // world
For example, customizing the source AND target:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'universe' }
const target = { HELLO: 'world' } // empty object

dotenv.populate(target, parsed, { override: true, debug: true })

console.log(target) // { HELLO: 'universe' }
options
Debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being populated as you expect.
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set.
‚ùì FAQ
Why is the .env file not loading my environment variables successfully?
Most likely your .env file is not in the correct place. See this stack overflow.
Turn on debug mode and try again..
require('dotenv').config({ debug: true })
You will receive a helpful error outputted to your console.
Should I commit my .env file?
No. We strongly recommend against committing your .env file to version
control. It should only include environment-specific values such as database
passwords or API keys. Your production database should have a different
password than your development database.
Should I have multiple .env files?
We recommend creating one .env file per environment. Use .env for local/development, .env.production for production and so on. This still follows the twelve factor principles as each is attributed individually to its own environment. Avoid custom set ups that work in inheritance somehow (.env.production inherits values form .env for example). It is better to duplicate values if necessary across each .env.environment file.

In a twelve-factor app, env vars are granular controls, each fully orthogonal to other env vars. They are never grouped together as ‚Äúenvironments‚Äù, but instead are independently managed for each deploy. This is a model that scales up smoothly as the app naturally expands into more deploys over its lifetime.
‚Äì The Twelve-Factor App

What rules does the parsing engine follow?
The parsing engine currently supports the following rules:

BASIC=basic becomes {BASIC: 'basic'}
empty lines are skipped
lines beginning with # are treated as comments
# marks the beginning of a comment (unless when the value is wrapped in quotes)
empty values become empty strings (EMPTY= becomes {EMPTY: ''})
inner quotes are maintained (think JSON) (JSON={"foo": "bar"} becomes {JSON:"{\"foo\": \"bar\"}")
whitespace is removed from both ends of unquoted values (see more on trim) (FOO=  some value   becomes {FOO: 'some value'})
single and double quoted values are escaped (SINGLE_QUOTE='quoted' becomes {SINGLE_QUOTE: "quoted"})
single and double quoted values maintain whitespace from both ends (FOO="  some value  " becomes {FOO: '  some value  '})
double quoted values expand new lines (MULTILINE="new\nline" becomes

{MULTILINE: 'new
line'}


backticks are supported (BACKTICK_KEY=`This has 'single' and "double" quotes inside of it.`)

What happens to environment variables that were already set?
By default, we will never modify any environment variables that have already been set. In particular, if there is a variable in your .env file which collides with one that already exists in your environment, then that variable will be skipped.
If instead, you want to override process.env use the override option.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
How come my environment variables are not showing up for React?
Your React code is run in Webpack, where the fs module or even the process global itself are not accessible out-of-the-box. process.env can only be injected through Webpack configuration.
If you are using react-scripts, which is distributed through create-react-app, it has dotenv built in but with a quirk. Preface your environment variables with REACT_APP_. See this stack overflow for more details.
If you are using other frameworks (e.g. Next.js, Gatsby...), you need to consult their documentation for how to inject environment variables into the client.
Can I customize/write plugins for dotenv?
Yes! dotenv.config() returns an object representing the parsed .env file. This gives you everything you need to continue setting values on process.env. For example:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const variableExpansion = require('dotenv-expand')
const myEnv = dotenv.config()
variableExpansion(myEnv)
How do I use dotenv with import?
Simply..
// index.mjs (ESM)
import 'dotenv/config' // see https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#how-do-i-use-dotenv-with-import
import express from 'express'
A little background..

When you run a module containing an import declaration, the modules it imports are loaded first, then each module body is executed in a depth-first traversal of the dependency graph, avoiding cycles by skipping anything already executed.
‚Äì ES6 In Depth: Modules

What does this mean in plain language? It means you would think the following would work but it won't.
errorReporter.mjs:
class Client {
  constructor (apiKey) {
    console.log('apiKey', apiKey)

    this.apiKey = apiKey
  }
}

export default new Client(process.env.API_KEY)
index.mjs:
// Note: this is INCORRECT and will not work
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv'
dotenv.config()

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs' // process.env.API_KEY will be blank!
process.env.API_KEY will be blank.
Instead, index.mjs should be written as..
import 'dotenv/config'

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs'
Does that make sense? It's a bit unintuitive, but it is how importing of ES6 modules work. Here is a working example of this pitfall.
There are two alternatives to this approach:

Preload dotenv: node --require dotenv/config index.js (Note: you do not need to import dotenv with this approach)
Create a separate file that will execute config first as outlined in this comment on #133

Why am I getting the error Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'crypto|os|path'?
You are using dotenv on the front-end and have not included a polyfill. Webpack < 5 used to include these for you. Do the following:
npm install node-polyfill-webpack-plugin
Configure your webpack.config.js to something like the following.
require('dotenv').config()

const path = require('path');
const webpack = require('webpack')

const NodePolyfillPlugin = require('node-polyfill-webpack-plugin')

module.exports = {
  mode: 'development',
  entry: './src/index.ts',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  plugins: [
    new NodePolyfillPlugin(),
    new webpack.DefinePlugin({
      'process.env': {
        HELLO: JSON.stringify(process.env.HELLO)
      }
    }),
  ]
};
Alternatively, just use dotenv-webpack which does this and more behind the scenes for you.
What about variable expansion?
Try dotenv-expand
What about syncing and securing .env files?
Use dotenvx
What if I accidentally commit my .env file to code?
Remove it, remove git history and then install the git pre-commit hook to prevent this from ever happening again.
brew install dotenvx/brew/dotenvx
dotenvx precommit --install

How can I prevent committing my .env file to a Docker build?
Use the docker prebuild hook.
# Dockerfile
...
RUN curl -fsS https://dotenvx.sh/ | sh
...
RUN dotenvx prebuild
CMD ["dotenvx", "run", "--", "node", "index.js"]

dotenv 

Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology.

üå± Install
npm install dotenv --save
You can also use an npm-compatible package manager like yarn or bun:
yarn add dotenv
# or
bun add dotenv
üèóÔ∏è Usage






Create a .env file in the root of your project (if using a monorepo structure like apps/backend/app.js, put it in the root of the folder where your app.js process runs):
S3_BUCKET="YOURS3BUCKET"
SECRET_KEY="YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE"
As early as possible in your application, import and configure dotenv:
require('dotenv').config()
console.log(process.env) // remove this after you've confirmed it is working
.. or using ES6?
import 'dotenv/config'
That's it. process.env now has the keys and values you defined in your .env file:
require('dotenv').config()
// or import 'dotenv/config' if you're using ES6

...

s3.getBucketCors({Bucket: process.env.S3_BUCKET}, function(err, data) {})
Multiline values
If you need multiline variables, for example private keys, those are now supported (>= v15.0.0) with line breaks:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
...
Kh9NV...
...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
Alternatively, you can double quote strings and use the \n character:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nKh9NV...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
Comments
Comments may be added to your file on their own line or inline:
# This is a comment
SECRET_KEY=YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE # comment
SECRET_HASH="something-with-a-#-hash"
Comments begin where a # exists, so if your value contains a # please wrap it in quotes. This is a breaking change from >= v15.0.0 and on.
Parsing
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Preload

Note: Consider using dotenvx instead of preloading. I am now doing (and recommending) so.
It serves the same purpose (you do not need to require and load dotenv), adds better debugging, and works with ANY language, framework, or platform. ‚Äì motdotla

You can use the --require (-r) command line option to preload dotenv. By doing this, you do not need to require and load dotenv in your application code.
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
The configuration options below are supported as command line arguments in the format dotenv_config_<option>=value
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env dotenv_config_debug=true
Additionally, you can use environment variables to set configuration options. Command line arguments will precede these.
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_<OPTION>=value node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_ENCODING=latin1 DOTENV_CONFIG_DEBUG=true node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env
Variable Expansion
You need to add the value of another variable in one of your variables? Use dotenv-expand.
Command Substitution
Use dotenvx to use command substitution.
Add the output of a command to one of your variables in your .env file.
# .env
DATABASE_URL="postgres://$(whoami)@localhost/my_database"
// index.js
console.log('DATABASE_URL', process.env.DATABASE_URL)
$ dotenvx run --debug -- node index.js
[dotenvx@0.14.1] injecting env (1) from .env
DATABASE_URL postgres://yourusername@localhost/my_database
Syncing
You need to keep .env files in sync between machines, environments, or team members? Use dotenvx to encrypt your .env files and safely include them in source control. This still subscribes to the twelve-factor app rules by generating a decryption key separate from code.
Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx to generate .env.ci, .env.production files, and more.
Deploying
You need to deploy your secrets in a cloud-agnostic manner? Use dotenvx to generate a private decryption key that is set on your production server.
üå¥ Manage Multiple Environments

Avoid custom set ups that work in inheritance somehow (.env.production inherits values form .env for example). It is better to duplicate values if necessary across each .env.environment file.

In a twelve-factor app, env vars are granular controls, each fully orthogonal to other env vars. They are never grouped together as ‚Äúenvironments‚Äù, but instead are independently managed for each deploy. This is a model that scales up smoothly as the app naturally expands into more deploys over its lifetime.
‚Äì The Twelve-Factor App

What rules does the parsing engine follow?
The parsing engine currently supports the following rules:

BASIC=basic becomes {BASIC: 'basic'}
empty lines are skipped
lines beginning with # are treated as comments
# marks the beginning of a comment (unless when the value is wrapped in quotes)
empty values become empty strings (EMPTY= becomes {EMPTY: ''})
inner quotes are maintained (think JSON) (JSON={"foo": "bar"} becomes {JSON:"{\"foo\": \"bar\"}")
whitespace is removed from both ends of unquoted values (see more on trim) (FOO=  some value   becomes {FOO: 'some value'})
single and double quoted values are escaped (SINGLE_QUOTE='quoted' becomes {SINGLE_QUOTE: "quoted"})
single and double quoted values maintain whitespace from both ends (FOO="  some value  " becomes {FOO: '  some value  '})
double quoted values expand new lines (MULTILINE="new\nline" becomes

{MULTILINE: 'new
line'}


backticks are supported (BACKTICK_KEY=`This has 'single' and "double" quotes inside of it.`)

What happens to environment variables that were already set?
By default, we will never modify any environment variables that have already been set. In particular, if there is a variable in your .env file which collides with one that already exists in your environment, then that variable will be skipped.
If instead, you want to override process.env use the override option.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
How come my environment variables are not showing up for React?
Your React code is run in Webpack, where the fs module or even the process global itself are not accessible out-of-the-box. process.env can only be injected through Webpack configuration.
If you are using react-scripts, which is distributed through create-react-app, it has dotenv built in but with a quirk. Preface your environment variables with REACT_APP_. See this stack overflow for more details.
If you are using other frameworks (e.g. Next.js, Gatsby...), you need to consult their documentation for how to inject environment variables into the client.
Can I customize/write plugins for dotenv?
Yes! dotenv.config() returns an object representing the parsed .env file. This gives you everything you need to continue setting values on process.env. For example:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const variableExpansion = require('dotenv-expand')
const myEnv = dotenv.config()
variableExpansion(myEnv)
How do I use dotenv with import?
Simply..
// index.mjs (ESM)
import 'dotenv/config' // see https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#how-do-i-use-dotenv-with-import
import express from 'express'
A little background..

When you run a module containing an import declaration, the modules it imports are loaded first, then each module body is executed in a depth-first traversal of the dependency graph, avoiding cycles by skipping anything already executed.
‚Äì ES6 In Depth: Modules

What does this mean in plain language? It means you would think the following would work but it won't.
errorReporter.mjs:
class Client {
  constructor (apiKey) {
    console.log('apiKey', apiKey)

    this.apiKey = apiKey
  }
}

export default new Client(process.env.API_KEY)
index.mjs:
// Note: this is INCORRECT and will not work
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv'
dotenv.config()

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs' // process.env.API_KEY will be blank!
process.env.API_KEY will be blank.
Instead, index.mjs should be written as..
import 'dotenv/config'

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs'
Does that make sense? It's a bit unintuitive, but it is how importing of ES6 modules work. Here is a working example of this pitfall.
There are two alternatives to this approach:

Preload dotenv: node --require dotenv/config index.js (Note: you do not need to import dotenv with this approach)
Create a separate file that will execute config first as outlined in this comment on #133

Why am I getting the error Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'crypto|os|path'?
You are using dotenv on the front-end and have not included a polyfill. Webpack < 5 used to include these for you. Do the following:
npm install node-polyfill-webpack-plugin
Configure your webpack.config.js to something like the following.
require('dotenv').config()

const path = require('path');
const webpack = require('webpack')

const NodePolyfillPlugin = require('node-polyfill-webpack-plugin')

module.exports = {
  mode: 'development',
  entry: './src/index.ts',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  plugins: [
    new NodePolyfillPlugin(),
    new webpack.DefinePlugin({
      'process.env': {
        HELLO: JSON.stringify(process.env.HELLO)
      }
    }),
  ]
};
Alternatively, just use dotenv-webpack which does this and more behind the scenes for you.
What about variable expansion?
Try dotenv-expand
What about syncing and securing .env files?
Use dotenvx
What if I accidentally commit my .env file to code?
Remove it, remove git history and then install the git pre-commit hook to prevent this from ever happening again.
brew install dotenvx/brew/dotenvx
dotenvx precommit --install

How can I prevent committing my .env file to a Docker build?
Use the docker prebuild hook.
# Dockerfile
...
RUN curl -fsS https://dotenvx.sh/ | sh
...
RUN dotenvx prebuild
CMD ["dotenvx", "run", "--", "node", "index.js"]

dotenv 

Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology.

üå± Install
npm install dotenv --save
You can also use an npm-compatible package manager like yarn or bun:
yarn add dotenv
# or
bun add dotenv
üèóÔ∏è Usage






Create a .env file in the root of your project (if using a monorepo structure like apps/backend/app.js, put it in the root of the folder where your app.js process runs):
S3_BUCKET="YOURS3BUCKET"
SECRET_KEY="YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE"
As early as possible in your application, import and configure dotenv:
require('dotenv').config()
console.log(process.env) // remove this after you've confirmed it is working
.. or using ES6?
import 'dotenv/config'
That's it. process.env now has the keys and values you defined in your .env file:
require('dotenv').config()
// or import 'dotenv/config' if you're using ES6

...

s3.getBucketCors({Bucket: process.env.S3_BUCKET}, function(err, data) {})
Multiline values
If you need multiline variables, for example private keys, those are now supported (>= v15.0.0) with line breaks:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
...
Kh9NV...
...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
Alternatively, you can double quote strings and use the \n character:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nKh9NV...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
Comments
Comments may be added to your file on their own line or inline:
# This is a comment
SECRET_KEY=YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE # comment
SECRET_HASH="something-with-a-#-hash"
Comments begin where a # exists, so if your value contains a # please wrap it in quotes. This is a breaking change from >= v15.0.0 and on.
Parsing
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Preload

Note: Consider using dotenvx instead of preloading. I am now doing (and recommending) so.
It serves the same purpose (you do not need to require and load dotenv), adds better debugging, and works with ANY language, framework, or platform. ‚Äì motdotla

You can use the --require (-r) command line option to preload dotenv. By doing this, you do not need to require and load dotenv in your application code.
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
The configuration options below are supported as command line arguments in the format dotenv_config_<option>=value
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env dotenv_config_debug=true
Additionally, you can use environment variables to set configuration options. Command line arguments will precede these.
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_<OPTION>=value node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_ENCODING=latin1 DOTENV_CONFIG_DEBUG=true node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env
Variable Expansion
You need to add the value of another variable in one of your variables? Use dotenv-expand.
Command Substitution
Use dotenvx to use command substitution.
Add the output of a command to one of your variables in your .env file.
# .env
DATABASE_URL="postgres://$(whoami)@localhost/my_database"
// index.js
console.log('DATABASE_URL', process.env.DATABASE_URL)
$ dotenvx run --debug -- node index.js
[dotenvx@0.14.1] injecting env (1) from .env
DATABASE_URL postgres://yourusername@localhost/my_database
Syncing
You need to keep .env files in sync between machines, environments, or team members? Use dotenvx to encrypt your .env files and safely include them in source control. This still subscribes to the twelve-factor app rules by generating a decryption key separate from code.
Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx to generate .env.ci, .env.production files, and more.
Deploying
You need to deploy your secrets in a cloud-agnostic manner? Use dotenvx to generate a private decryption key that is set on your production server.
üå¥ Manage Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx
Run any environment locally. Create a .env.ENVIRONMENT file and use --env-file to load it. It's straightforward, yet flexible.
$ echo "HELLO=production" > .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.production -- node index.js
Hello production
> ^^
or with multiple .env files
$ echo "HELLO=local" > .env.local
$ echo "HELLO=World" > .env
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.local --env-file=.env -- node index.js
Hello local
more environment examples
üöÄ Deploying
Use dotenvx.
Add encryption to your .env files with a single command. Pass the --encrypt flag.
$ dotenvx set HELLO Production --encrypt -f .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION="<.env.production private key>" dotenvx run -- node index.js
[dotenvx] injecting env (2) from .env.production
Hello Production

üìñ Documentation
Dotenv exposes four functions:

config
parse
populate
decrypt

Config
config will read your .env file, parse the contents, assign it to
process.env,
and return an Object with a parsed key containing the loaded content or an error key if it failed.
const result = dotenv.config()

if (result.error) {
  throw result.error
}

console.log(result.parsed)
You can additionally, pass options to config.
Options
path
Default: path.resolve(process.cwd(), '.env')
Specify a custom path if your file containing environment variables is located elsewhere.
require('dotenv').config({ path: '/custom/path/to/.env' })
By default, config will look for a file called .env in the current working directory.
Pass in multiple files as an array, and they will be parsed in order and combined with process.env (or option.processEnv, if set). The first value set for a variable will win, unless the options.override flag is set, in which case the last value set will win.  If a value already exists in process.env and the options.override flag is NOT set, no changes will be made to that value.
require('dotenv').config({ path: ['.env.local', '.env'] })
encoding
Default: utf8
Specify the encoding of your file containing environment variables.
require('dotenv').config({ encoding: 'latin1' })
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
require('dotenv').config({ debug: process.env.DEBUG })
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set on your machine with values from your .env file(s). If multiple files have been provided in option.path the override will also be used as each file is combined with the next. Without override being set, the first value wins. With override set the last value wins.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
processEnv
Default: process.env
Specify an object to write your environment variables to. Defaults to process.env environment variables.
const myObject = {}
require('dotenv').config({ processEnv: myObject })

console.log(myObject) // values from .env
console.log(process.env) // this was not changed or written to
Parse
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment
variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return
an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Options
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('hello world')
const opt = { debug: true }
const config = dotenv.parse(buf, opt)
// expect a debug message because the buffer is not in KEY=VAL form
Populate
The engine which populates the contents of your .env file to process.env is available for use. It accepts a target, a source, and options. This is useful for power users who want to supply their own objects.
For example, customizing the source:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'world' }

dotenv.populate(process.env, parsed)

console.log(process.env.HELLO) // world
For example, customizing the source AND target:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'universe' }
const target = { HELLO: 'world' } // empty object

dotenv.populate(target, parsed, { override: true, debug: true })

console.log(target) // { HELLO: 'universe' }
options
Debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being populated as you expect.
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set.
‚ùì FAQ
Why is the .env file not loading my environment variables successfully?
Most likely your .env file is not in the correct place. See this stack overflow.
Turn on debug mode and try again..
require('dotenv').config({ debug: true })
You will receive a helpful error outputted to your console.
Should I commit my .env file?
No. We strongly recommend against committing your .env file to version
control. It should only include environment-specific values such as database
passwords or API keys. Your production database should have a different
password than your development database.
Should I have multiple .env files?
We recommend creating one .env file per environment. Use .env for local/development, .env.production for production and so on. This still follows the twelve factor principles as each is attributed individually to its own environment. Avoid custom set ups that work in inheritance somehow (.env.production inherits values form .env for example). It is better to duplicate values if necessary across each .env.environment file.

In a twelve-factor app, env vars are granular controls, each fully orthogonal to other env vars. They are never grouped together as ‚Äúenvironments‚Äù, but instead are independently managed for each deploy. This is a model that scales up smoothly as the app naturally expands into more deploys over its lifetime.

errorReporter.mjs:

Does that make sense? It's a bit unintuitive, but it is how importing of ES6 modules work. Here is a working example of this pitfall.
There are two alternatives to this approach:

You are using dotenv on the front-end and have not included a polyfill. Webpack < 5 used to include these for you. Do the following:
npm install node-polyfill-webpack-plugin
Configure your webpack.config.js to something like the following.
require('dotenv').config()

const path = require('path');
const webpack = require('webpack')

const NodePolyfillPlugin = require('node-polyfill-webpack-plugin')

module.exports = {
  mode: 'development',
  entry: './src/index.ts',

};
Alternatively, just use dotenv-webpack which does this and more behind the scenes for you.
What about variable expansion?
Try dotenv-expand
What about syncing and securing .env files?
Use dotenvx
What if I accidentally commit my .env file to code?
Remove it, remove git history and then install the git pre-commit hook to prevent this from ever happening again.
brew install dotenvx/brew/dotenvx
dotenvx precommit --install

How can I prevent committing my .env file to a Docker build?
Use the docker prebuild hook.
# Dockerfile
...
RUN curl -fsS https://dotenvx.sh/ | sh
...
RUN dotenvx prebuild
CMD ["dotenvx", "run", "--", "node", "index.js"]

Backed by the leaders in AI, GitHub Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With GitHub Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on: value, innovation, and happiness.GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That‚Äôs why developers who use GitHub Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don‚Äôt and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, GitHub Copilot is the world‚Äôs most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, student, faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.¬†
What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot‚Äôs best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains, and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.Does GitHub Copilot ‚Äúcopy/paste‚Äù?No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create GitHub Copilot‚Äôs suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not ‚Äúcopying and pasting‚Äù from any codebase.To generate a code suggestion, the GitHub Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor‚Äîfocusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to GitHub Copilot‚Äôs model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the GitHub Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to GitHub Copilot‚Äôs model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, GitHub Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to GitHub Copilot‚Äôs model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.¬† What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also¬† adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with GitHub Copilot¬†throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization‚Äôs codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer‚Äôs knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in GitHub Advanced Security.What if I do not want GitHub Copilot?GitHub Copilot is entirely optional and requires you to opt in before gaining access. You can easily configure its usage directly in the editor, enabling or disabling it at any time. Additionally, you have control over which file types GitHub Copilot is active for.How do I control access to GitHub Copilot in my company?Access to Copilot Business and Enterprise is managed by your GitHub Administrator. They can control access to preview features, models, and set GitHub Copilot policies for your organization. Additionally, you can use your network firewall to explicitly allow access to Copilot Business and/or block access to Copilot Pro or Free. For more details, refer to the documentation.Plans & pricingWhat are the differences between the Free, Pro, Business, and Enterprise plans?GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance.

The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.How can I upgrade my GitHub Copilot Free license to Copilot Pro?If you're on the Free plan, you can upgrade to Pro through your Copilot settings page or directly on the Copilot marketing page.What is included in GitHub Copilot Free?GitHub Copilot Free users are limited to 2000 completions and 50 chat requests (including Copilot Edits).Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in GitHub Advanced Security and available to all public repositories.PrivacyWhat personal data does GitHub Copilot process?GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:User Engagement Data: This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.¬†Prompts: These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.¬†Suggestions: These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.¬†Feedback Data: This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub‚Äôs model?No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.¬†How does GitHub use the Copilot data?How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendationsTroubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-datenessEnhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operationalThese practices are outlined in GitHub‚Äôs Data Protection Agreement (DPA), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.¬†GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:Billing and account managementTo comply with and resolve legal obligations¬†For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of serviceTo generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentivesTo produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the GitHub Privacy Statement.How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers? If and for how long GitHub‚Äôs retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:¬†Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:Prompts and Suggestions: Not retainedUser Engagement Data: Kept for two years.Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.All other GitHub Copilot access and use:Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features‚Äô effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.¬†Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a Data Protection Agreement that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU‚Äôs General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.¬†How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the GitHub Privacy Statement.
Responsible AIWhat are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot‚Äôs suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here‚Äôs some basic information you should know about these considerations:Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:¬† Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot‚Äôs AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub‚Äôs public repositories‚Äîwhich are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub‚Äôs research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub‚Äôs AI model. Again, Copilot does not ‚Äúlook up‚Äù or ‚Äúcopy and paste‚Äù code, but is instead using context from a user‚Äôs workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot‚Äôs model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.¬†With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a code referencing feature as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there‚Äôs a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories‚Äîincluding ones without licenses‚Äîthat code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?We don‚Äôt determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‚Äòfunctional‚Äô instead of expressive, etc).If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or                        idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also                        synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that                        either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including hardcoded credentials, SQL injections, and path injections. Additionally, in recent years we‚Äôve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It‚Äôs not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.The product is called ‚ÄúCopilot‚Äù not ‚ÄúAutopilot‚Äù and it‚Äôs not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot‚Äôs suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses ‚Äì rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. ‚Äì you should continue these policies with Copilot‚Äôs suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective                        risk tolerances.As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot‚Äôs suggestions.Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.You‚Äôre entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot‚Äôs filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment for more details.Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot‚Äôs ease of use by developers with                        disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our feedback forum.Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid                        synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter                        system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found here.Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans.

Backed by the leaders in AI, GitHub Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With GitHub Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on: value, innovation, and happiness.GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That‚Äôs why developers who use GitHub Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don‚Äôt and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, GitHub Copilot is the world‚Äôs most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, student, faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.¬†
What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot‚Äôs best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains, and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.Does GitHub Copilot ‚Äúcopy/paste‚Äù?No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create GitHub Copilot‚Äôs suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not ‚Äúcopying and pasting‚Äù from any codebase.To generate a code suggestion, the GitHub Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor‚Äîfocusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to GitHub Copilot‚Äôs model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the GitHub Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to GitHub Copilot‚Äôs model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, GitHub Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to GitHub Copilot‚Äôs model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.¬† What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers.

The types of personal data processed may include:User Engagement Data: This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.¬†Prompts: These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.¬†Suggestions: These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.¬†Feedback Data: This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub‚Äôs model?No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.¬†How does GitHub use the Copilot data?How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendationsTroubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-datenessEnhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operationalThese practices are outlined in GitHub‚Äôs Data Protection Agreement (DPA), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.¬†GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:Billing and account managementTo comply with and resolve legal obligations¬†For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of serviceTo generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentivesTo produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the GitHub Privacy Statement.How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers? If and for how long GitHub‚Äôs retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:¬†Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:Prompts and Suggestions: Not retainedUser Engagement Data: Kept for two years.Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.All other GitHub Copilot access and use:Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features‚Äô effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.¬†Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a Data Protection Agreement that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU‚Äôs General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.¬†How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the GitHub Privacy Statement.
Responsible AIWhat are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot‚Äôs suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here‚Äôs some basic information you should know about these considerations:Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:¬† Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot‚Äôs AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub‚Äôs public repositories‚Äîwhich are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub‚Äôs research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub‚Äôs AI model. Again, Copilot does not ‚Äúlook up‚Äù or ‚Äúcopy and paste‚Äù code, but is instead using context from a user‚Äôs workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot‚Äôs model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.¬†With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a code referencing feature as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there‚Äôs a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories‚Äîincluding ones without licenses‚Äîthat code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?We don‚Äôt determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‚Äòfunctional‚Äô instead of expressive, etc).If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or                        idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also                        synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that                        either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including hardcoded credentials, SQL injections, and path injections. Additionally, in recent years we‚Äôve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It‚Äôs not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.The product is called ‚ÄúCopilot‚Äù not ‚ÄúAutopilot‚Äù and it‚Äôs not intended to generate code without oversight.

‚ÄúThe new planning and tracking functionality keeps my project management close to my code. I no longer find myself needing to reach for spreadsheets or 3P tools which go stale instantly.Dan GodfreyDevelopment ManagerFlexible project planning for¬†developers Start using projectsContact salesFrequently asked¬†questionsWhat is GitHub Issues?We all need a way to plan our work, track issues, and discuss the things we build. Our answer to this universal question is GitHub Issues, and it‚Äôs built-in to every repository. GitHub‚Äôs issue tracking is unique because of our focus on simplicity, references, and elegant formatting.With GitHub Issues, you can express ideas with GitHub Flavored Markdown, assign and mention contributors, react with emojis, clarify with attachments and videos, plus reference code like commits, pull requests, and deploys. With task lists, you can break big issues into tasks, further organize your work with milestones and labels, and track relationships and dependencies.We built GitHub Issues for developers. It is simple, adaptable, and powerful.What are Projects?As teams and projects grow, how we work evolves. Tools that hard-code a methodology are too specific and rigid to adapt to any moment. Often, we find ourselves creating a spreadsheet or pulling out a notepad to have the space to think. Then our planning is disconnected from where the work happens.The new Projects connect your planning directly to the work your teams are doing and flexibly adapt to whatever your team needs at any point. Built like a spreadsheet, project tables give you a live canvas to filter, sort, and group issues and pull requests. You can use it, or the accompanying project board, along with custom fields, to track a sprint, plan a feature, or manage a large-scale release.What plans have access to Projects?All users have access to the free tier of GitHub Issues and Projects. For more information about paid tiers, see our pricing page.Will the new Projects experience be available in GitHub Enterprise Server?Yes!

GitHub Copilot functionality works in code editors regardless of code hosting platform. Some features are enhanced with the use of GitHub because Copilot can directly draw context and knowledge from repositories, pull requests, issues, and other data structures in the GitHub platform.
Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub‚Äôs model?No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.¬†
Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.¬†With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a Data Protection Agreement that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.\n\n\n\nEnterprise

        What is escalation and incident management?
      
    
    
      Escalation and incident management is the ability to escalate ticket progression in the GitHub support portal. After someone escalates a ticket, Support Incident Coordinators orchestrate all necessary parties to resolve the ticket. Additionally, Senior Escalation Engineers (SEEs) facilitate GitHub-internal technical communications and liaise with the rest of GitHub to improve the support team‚Äôs capability in similar future circumstances.

      Incident response management helps manage the technical resources needed for case resolution. Support Incident Coordinators are available for incident response management 24/7.
      
    
  


    
  
    
      
      
        What are my SLAs for initial response?
      
    
    
      GitHub Premium Support and GitHub Premium Plus Support customers have SLAs. For urgent priority tickets, your SLA guarantees a 30-minute initial response time, which includes troubleshooting. For high priority tickets, your SLA provides a four-hour initial response time.
      
    
  


    
  
    
      
      
        What‚Äôs included in initial troubleshooting?
      
    
    
      For initial troubleshooting, the assigned Premium Support Engineer/Customer Reliability Engineer will review and acknowledge your ticket. To better understand the issue and start troubleshooting, the engineer may ask for additional information such as screenshots, error messages, log files, diagnostics files, support bundles, or the output of specific console commands. They may also collaborate with others in support, engineering, or in the regional incident commander.
If a callback was requested, the engineer will determine if screen sharing is the most effective way to drive ticket resolution. If so, they will invite you to join a screen-sharing session.
      
    
  


    
  
    
      
      
        How do I get health check reports?
      
    
    
      GitHub Premium Support and GitHub Premium Plus Support customers are entitled to unlimited automated health check reports. Additionally, GitHub Premium Plus Support customers can request quarterly enhanced health checks with findings, interpretations, and recommendations from a Customer Reliability Engineer (CRE).
      
    
  


    
  
    
      
      
        What is crisis prevention?
      
    
    
      Crisis prevention allows GitHub Enterprise Server customers to prepare for ‚Äî and experience ‚Äî an incident without risk. Your Customer Reliability Engineer (CRE) guides your team through an incident simulation in a safe and controlled environment.
Crisis Prevention consists of up to four sessions about reliability best practices, preparing for a potential incident, and efficiently interacting with GitHub Support. After the incident simulation, your CRE will run a detailed retrospective, uncovering lessons learned and improvement suggestions for the future.
      
    
  


    
  
    
      
      
        How long does GitHub Premium Support take?
      
    
    
      GitHub Premium Support and GitHub Premium Plus Support Plus customers have service-level agreements (SLAs) for initial response. For urgent priority tickets, the initial response SLA guarantees a 30-minute initial response time, which includes troubleshooting. For high-priority tickets, the initial response SLA provides a four-hour time.
We currently do not provide estimates for time to resolution, as the complexity of tickets varies. However, we review these metrics on a regular basis and reduce times whenever possible.
      
    
  


    
  
    
      
      
        How do I resolve a problem in GitHub Enterprise?
      
    
    
      You can get support via online ticket submission if you‚Äôre using the basic plan included with your GitHub Enterprise license. If you have GitHub Premium Support or GitHub Premium Plus Support, you can submit a ticket online. For urgent tickets, GitHub Premium Support and GitHub Premium Plus Support customers can request a callback and have a screen-sharing session with one of our Premium Support Engineers or Customer Reliability Engineers (CREs). Please refer to our plan comparison table for more details.
      
    
  



          Rules and policies


    
  
    
      
      
        If I do not use all the technical advisory hours in a given quarter, can they be carried over?
      
    
    
      Premium Plus customers may use up to 12 technical advisory hours per quarter. Unused technical advisory hours may not be carried over into the next quarter.
      
    
  


    
  
    
      
      
        How can the technical advisory support hours be used?

          Upgrading your plan


    
  
    
      
      
        What virtual trainings are available with GitHub Premium Plus Support and who can participate?

        What value will I get by upgrading to GitHub Premium Plus Support?
      
    
    
      GitHub Premium Plus Support customers get an assigned Customer Reliability Engineer (CRE), quarterly enhanced health checks, access to crisis prevention, technical advisory hours, and many additional benefits, which you can review in our plan comparison table.
      
    
  


    
  
    
      
      
        What‚Äôs the benefit of having a Customer Reliability Engineer (CRE) over a Premium Support Engineer?
      
    
    
      A CRE knows your customer account in detail and can help you expedite case resolution faster than a Premium Support Engineer.
      
    
  


    
  
    
      
      
        Since I get GitHub Enterprise Support for free, why should I upgrade to GitHub Premium Support?
      
    
    
      Most customers upgrade to GitHub Premium Support because they need initial response SLAs for urgent and high priority requests, phone support, screen share support for critical issues, and health checks. To see a full list of features for GitHub Premium Support packages, please refer to our plan comparison table.

dotenv 

Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology.

üå± Install
npm install dotenv --save
You can also use an npm-compatible package manager like yarn or bun:
yarn add dotenv
# or
bun add dotenv
üèóÔ∏è Usage






Create a .env file in the root of your project (if using a monorepo structure like apps/backend/app.js, put it in the root of the folder where your app.js process runs):
S3_BUCKET="YOURS3BUCKET"
SECRET_KEY="YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE"
As early as possible in your application, import and configure dotenv:
require('dotenv').config()
console.log(process.env) // remove this after you've confirmed it is working
.. or using ES6?
import 'dotenv/config'
That's it. process.env now has the keys and values you defined in your .env file:
require('dotenv').config()
// or import 'dotenv/config' if you're using ES6

...

s3.getBucketCors({Bucket: process.env.S3_BUCKET}, function(err, data) {})
Multiline values
If you need multiline variables, for example private keys, those are now supported (>= v15.0.0) with line breaks:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
...
Kh9NV...
...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
Alternatively, you can double quote strings and use the \n character:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nKh9NV...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
Comments
Comments may be added to your file on their own line or inline:
# This is a comment
SECRET_KEY=YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE # comment
SECRET_HASH="something-with-a-#-hash"
Comments begin where a # exists, so if your value contains a # please wrap it in quotes. This is a breaking change from >= v15.0.0 and on.
Parsing
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Preload

Note: Consider using dotenvx instead of preloading. I am now doing (and recommending) so.
It serves the same purpose (you do not need to require and load dotenv), adds better debugging, and works with ANY language, framework, or platform. ‚Äì motdotla

You can use the --require (-r) command line option to preload dotenv. By doing this, you do not need to require and load dotenv in your application code.
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
The configuration options below are supported as command line arguments in the format dotenv_config_<option>=value
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env dotenv_config_debug=true
Additionally, you can use environment variables to set configuration options. Command line arguments will precede these.
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_<OPTION>=value node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_ENCODING=latin1 DOTENV_CONFIG_DEBUG=true node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env
Variable Expansion
You need to add the value of another variable in one of your variables? Use dotenv-expand.
Command Substitution
Use dotenvx to use command substitution.
Add the output of a command to one of your variables in your .env file.
# .env
DATABASE_URL="postgres://$(whoami)@localhost/my_database"
// index.js
console.log('DATABASE_URL', process.env.DATABASE_URL)
$ dotenvx run --debug -- node index.js
[dotenvx@0.14.1] injecting env (1) from .env
DATABASE_URL postgres://yourusername@localhost/my_database
Syncing
You need to keep .env files in sync between machines, environments, or team members? Use dotenvx to encrypt your .env files and safely include them in source control. This still subscribes to the twelve-factor app rules by generating a decryption key separate from code.
Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx to generate .env.ci, .env.production files, and more.
Deploying
You need to deploy your secrets in a cloud-agnostic manner? Use dotenvx to generate a private decryption key that is set on your production server.
üå¥ Manage Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx
Run any environment locally. Create a .env.ENVIRONMENT file and use --env-file to load it. It's straightforward, yet flexible.
$ echo "HELLO=production" > .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.production -- node index.js
Hello production
> ^^
or with multiple .env files
$ echo "HELLO=local" > .env.local
$ echo "HELLO=World" > .env
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.local --env-file=.env -- node index.js
Hello local

üöÄ Deploying
Use dotenvx.
Add encryption to your .env files with a single command. Pass the --encrypt flag.
$ dotenvx set HELLO Production --encrypt -f .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION="<.env.production private key>" dotenvx run -- node index.js

üìñ Documentation
Dotenv exposes four functions:

config
parse
populate
decrypt

Config
config will read your .env file, parse the contents, assign it to
process.env,
and return an Object with a parsed key containing the loaded content or an error key if it failed.
const result = dotenv.config()

if (result.error) {
  throw result.error
}

console.log(result.parsed)
You can additionally, pass options to config.
Options
path
Default: path.resolve(process.cwd(), '.env')
Specify a custom path if your file containing environment variables is located elsewhere.
require('dotenv').config({ path: '/custom/path/to/.env' })
By default, config will look for a file called .env in the current working directory.
Pass in multiple files as an array, and they will be parsed in order and combined with process.env (or option.processEnv, if set). The first value set for a variable will win, unless the options.override flag is set, in which case the last value set will win.  If a value already exists in process.env and the options.override flag is NOT set, no changes will be made to that value.
require('dotenv').config({ path: ['.env.local', '.env'] })
encoding
Default: utf8
Specify the encoding of your file containing environment variables.
require('dotenv').config({ encoding: 'latin1' })
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
require('dotenv').config({ debug: process.env.DEBUG })
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set on your machine with values from your .env file(s). If multiple files have been provided in option.path the override will also be used as each file is combined with the next. Without override being set, the first value wins. With override set the last value wins.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
processEnv
Default: process.env
Specify an object to write your environment variables to. Defaults to process.env environment variables.
const myObject = {}
require('dotenv').config({ processEnv: myObject })

console.log(myObject) // values from .env
console.log(process.env) // this was not changed or written to
Parse
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment
variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return
an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Options
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('hello world')
const opt = { debug: true }
const config = dotenv.parse(buf, opt)
// expect a debug message because the buffer is not in KEY=VAL form
Populate
The engine which populates the contents of your .env file to process.env is available for use. It accepts a target, a source, and options. This is useful for power users who want to supply their own objects.
For example, customizing the source:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'world' }

dotenv.populate(process.env, parsed)

console.log(process.env.HELLO) // world
For example, customizing the source AND target:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'universe' }
const target = { HELLO: 'world' } // empty object

dotenv.populate(target, parsed, { override: true, debug: true })

console.log(target) // { HELLO: 'universe' }
options
Debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being populated as you expect.
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set.
‚ùì FAQ
Why is the .env file not loading my environment variables successfully?
Most likely your .env file is not in the correct place. See this stack overflow.
Turn on debug mode and try again..
require('dotenv').config({ debug: true })
You will receive a helpful error outputted to your console.
Should I commit my .env file?
No. We strongly recommend against committing your .env file to version
control. It should only include environment-specific values such as database
passwords or API keys. Your production database should have a different
password than your development database.
Should I have multiple .env files?
We recommend creating one .env file per environment. Use .env for local/development, .env.production for production and so on. This still follows the twelve factor principles as each is attributed individually to its own environment. Avoid custom set ups that work in inheritance somehow (.env.production inherits values form .env for example). It is better to duplicate values if necessary across each .env.environment file.

In a twelve-factor app, env vars are granular controls, each fully orthogonal to other env vars. They are never grouped together as ‚Äúenvironments‚Äù, but instead are independently managed for each deploy. This is a model that scales up smoothly as the app naturally expands into more deploys over its lifetime.
‚Äì The Twelve-Factor App

What rules does the parsing engine follow?
The parsing engine currently supports the following rules:

BASIC=basic becomes {BASIC: 'basic'}
empty lines are skipped
lines beginning with # are treated as comments
# marks the beginning of a comment (unless when the value is wrapped in quotes)
empty values become empty strings (EMPTY= becomes {EMPTY: ''})
inner quotes are maintained (think JSON) (JSON={"foo": "bar"} becomes {JSON:"{\"foo\": \"bar\"}")
whitespace is removed from both ends of unquoted values (see more on trim) (FOO=  some value   becomes {FOO: 'some value'})
single and double quoted values are escaped (SINGLE_QUOTE='quoted' becomes {SINGLE_QUOTE: "quoted"})
single and double quoted values maintain whitespace from both ends (FOO="  some value  " becomes {FOO: '  some value  '})
double quoted values expand new lines (MULTILINE="new\nline" becomes

{MULTILINE: 'new
line'}


backticks are supported (BACKTICK_KEY=`This has 'single' and "double" quotes inside of it.`)

What happens to environment variables that were already set?
By default, we will never modify any environment variables that have already been set. In particular, if there is a variable in your .env file which collides with one that already exists in your environment, then that variable will be skipped.
If instead, you want to override process.env use the override option.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
How come my environment variables are not showing up for React?
Your React code is run in Webpack, where the fs module or even the process global itself are not accessible out-of-the-box. process.env can only be injected through Webpack configuration.
If you are using react-scripts, which is distributed through create-react-app, it has dotenv built in but with a quirk. Preface your environment variables with REACT_APP_. See this stack overflow for more details.
If you are using other frameworks (e.g. Next.js, Gatsby...), you need to consult their documentation for how to inject environment variables into the client.
Can I customize/write plugins for dotenv?
Yes! dotenv.config() returns an object representing the parsed .env file. This gives you everything you need to continue setting values on process.env. For example:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const variableExpansion = require('dotenv-expand')
const myEnv = dotenv.config()
variableExpansion(myEnv)
How do I use dotenv with import?
Simply..
// index.mjs (ESM)
import 'dotenv/config' // see https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#how-do-i-use-dotenv-with-import
import express from 'express'
A little background..

When you run a module containing an import declaration, the modules it imports are loaded first, then each module body is executed in a depth-first traversal of the dependency graph, avoiding cycles by skipping anything already executed.
‚Äì ES6 In Depth: Modules

What does this mean in plain language? It means you would think the following would work but it won't.
errorReporter.mjs:
class Client {
  constructor (apiKey) {
    console.log('apiKey', apiKey)

    this.apiKey = apiKey
  }
}

export default new Client(process.env.API_KEY)
index.mjs:
// Note: this is INCORRECT and will not work
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv'
dotenv.config()

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs' // process.env.API_KEY will be blank!
process.env.API_KEY will be blank.
Instead, index.mjs should be written as..
import 'dotenv/config'

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs'
Does that make sense? It's a bit unintuitive, but it is how importing of ES6 modules work. Here is a working example of this pitfall.
There are two alternatives to this approach:

Preload dotenv: node --require dotenv/config index.js (Note: you do not need to import dotenv with this approach)
Create a separate file that will execute config first as outlined in this comment on #133

Why am I getting the error Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'crypto|os|path'?
You are using dotenv on the front-end and have not included a polyfill. Webpack < 5 used to include these for you. Do the following:
npm install node-polyfill-webpack-plugin
Configure your webpack.config.js to something like the following.
require('dotenv').config()

const path = require('path');
const webpack = require('webpack')

const NodePolyfillPlugin = require('node-polyfill-webpack-plugin')

module.exports = {
  mode: 'development',
  entry: './src/index.ts',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  plugins: [
    new NodePolyfillPlugin(),
    new webpack.DefinePlugin({
      'process.env': {
        HELLO: JSON.stringify(process.env.HELLO)
      }
    }),
  ]
};
Alternatively, just use dotenv-webpack which does this and more behind the scenes for you.
What about variable expansion?
Try dotenv-expand
What about syncing and securing .env files?
Use dotenvx
What if I accidentally commit my .env file to code?
Remove it, remove git history and then install the git pre-commit hook to prevent this from ever happening again.
brew install dotenvx/brew/dotenvx
dotenvx precommit --install

How can I prevent committing my .env file to a Docker build?
Use the docker prebuild hook.
# Dockerfile
...
RUN curl -fsS https://dotenvx.sh/ | sh
...
RUN dotenvx prebuild
CMD ["dotenvx", "run", "--", "node", "index.js"]

dotenv 

Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology.

üå± Install
npm install dotenv --save
You can also use an npm-compatible package manager like yarn or bun:
yarn add dotenv
# or
bun add dotenv
üèóÔ∏è Usage






Create a .env file in the root of your project (if using a monorepo structure like apps/backend/app.js, put it in the root of the folder where your app.js process runs):
S3_BUCKET="YOURS3BUCKET"
SECRET_KEY="YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE"
As early as possible in your application, import and configure dotenv:
require('dotenv').config()
console.log(process.env) // remove this after you've confirmed it is working
.. or using ES6?
import 'dotenv/config'
That's it. process.env now has the keys and values you defined in your .env file:
require('dotenv').config()
// or import 'dotenv/config' if you're using ES6

...

s3.getBucketCors({Bucket: process.env.S3_BUCKET}, function(err, data) {})
Multiline values
If you need multiline variables, for example private keys, those are now supported (>= v15.0.0) with line breaks:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
...
Kh9NV...
...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
Alternatively, you can double quote strings and use the \n character:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nKh9NV...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
Comments
Comments may be added to your file on their own line or inline:
# This is a comment
SECRET_KEY=YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE # comment
SECRET_HASH="something-with-a-#-hash"
Comments begin where a # exists, so if your value contains a # please wrap it in quotes. This is a breaking change from >= v15.0.0 and on.
Parsing
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Preload

Note: Consider using dotenvx instead of preloading. I am now doing (and recommending) so.
It serves the same purpose (you do not need to require and load dotenv), adds better debugging, and works with ANY language, framework, or platform. ‚Äì motdotla

You can use the --require (-r) command line option to preload dotenv. By doing this, you do not need to require and load dotenv in your application code.
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
The configuration options below are supported as command line arguments in the format dotenv_config_<option>=value
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env dotenv_config_debug=true
Additionally, you can use environment variables to set configuration options. Command line arguments will precede these.
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_<OPTION>=value node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_ENCODING=latin1 DOTENV_CONFIG_DEBUG=true node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env
Variable Expansion
You need to add the value of another variable in one of your variables? Use dotenv-expand.
Command Substitution
Use dotenvx to use command substitution.
Add the output of a command to one of your variables in your .env file.
# .env
DATABASE_URL="postgres://$(whoami)@localhost/my_database"
// index.js
console.log('DATABASE_URL', process.env.DATABASE_URL)
$ dotenvx run --debug -- node index.js
[dotenvx@0.14.1] injecting env (1) from .env
DATABASE_URL postgres://yourusername@localhost/my_database
Syncing
You need to keep .env files in sync between machines, environments, or team members? Use dotenvx to encrypt your .env files and safely include them in source control. This still subscribes to the twelve-factor app rules by generating a decryption key separate from code.

üìñ Documentation
Dotenv exposes four functions:

config
parse
populate
decrypt

Config
config will read your .env file, parse the contents, assign it to
process.env,
and return an Object with a parsed key containing the loaded content or an error key if it failed.
const result = dotenv.config()

if (result.error) {
  throw result.error
}

console.log(result.parsed)
You can additionally, pass options to config.
Options
path
Default: path.resolve(process.cwd(), '.env')
Specify a custom path if your file containing environment variables is located elsewhere.
require('dotenv').config({ path: '/custom/path/to/.env' })
By default, config will look for a file called .env in the current working directory.
Pass in multiple files as an array, and they will be parsed in order and combined with process.env (or option.processEnv, if set). The first value set for a variable will win, unless the options.override flag is set, in which case the last value set will win.  If a value already exists in process.env and the options.override flag is NOT set, no changes will be made to that value.
require('dotenv').config({ path: ['.env.local', '.env'] })
encoding
Default: utf8
Specify the encoding of your file containing environment variables.
require('dotenv').config({ encoding: 'latin1' })
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
require('dotenv').config({ debug: process.env.DEBUG })
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set on your machine with values from your .env file(s). If multiple files have been provided in option.path the override will also be used as each file is combined with the next. Without override being set, the first value wins. With override set the last value wins.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
processEnv
Default: process.env
Specify an object to write your environment variables to. Defaults to process.env environment variables.
const myObject = {}
require('dotenv').config({ processEnv: myObject })

console.log(myObject) // values from .env
console.log(process.env) // this was not changed or written to
Parse
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment
variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return
an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Options
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('hello world')
const opt = { debug: true }
const config = dotenv.parse(buf, opt)
// expect a debug message because the buffer is not in KEY=VAL form
Populate
The engine which populates the contents of your .env file to process.env is available for use. It accepts a target, a source, and options. This is useful for power users who want to supply their own objects.
For example, customizing the source:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'world' }

dotenv.populate(process.env, parsed)

console.log(process.env.HELLO) // world
For example, customizing the source AND target:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'universe' }
const target = { HELLO: 'world' } // empty object

dotenv.populate(target, parsed, { override: true, debug: true })

console.log(target) // { HELLO: 'universe' }
options
Debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being populated as you expect.
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set.
‚ùì FAQ
Why is the .env file not loading my environment variables successfully?
Most likely your .env file is not in the correct place. See this stack overflow.
Turn on debug mode and try again..
require('dotenv').config({ debug: true })
You will receive a helpful error outputted to your console.
Should I commit my .env file?
No. We strongly recommend against committing your .env file to version
control. It should only include environment-specific values such as database
passwords or API keys. Your production database should have a different
password than your development database.
Should I have multiple .env files?
We recommend creating one .env file per environment. Use .env for local/development, .env.production for production and so on. This still follows the twelve factor principles as each is attributed individually to its own environment. Avoid custom set ups that work in inheritance somehow (.env.production inherits values form .env for example). It is better to duplicate values if necessary across each .env.environment file.

In a twelve-factor app, env vars are granular controls, each fully orthogonal to other env vars. They are never grouped together as ‚Äúenvironments‚Äù, but instead are independently managed for each deploy. This is a model that scales up smoothly as the app naturally expands into more deploys over its lifetime.
‚Äì The Twelve-Factor App

What rules does the parsing engine follow?
The parsing engine currently supports the following rules:

BASIC=basic becomes {BASIC: 'basic'}
empty lines are skipped
lines beginning with # are treated as comments
# marks the beginning of a comment (unless when the value is wrapped in quotes)
empty values become empty strings (EMPTY= becomes {EMPTY: ''})
inner quotes are maintained (think JSON) (JSON={"foo": "bar"} becomes {JSON:"{\"foo\": \"bar\"}")
whitespace is removed from both ends of unquoted values (see more on trim) (FOO=  some value   becomes {FOO: 'some value'})
single and double quoted values are escaped (SINGLE_QUOTE='quoted' becomes {SINGLE_QUOTE: "quoted"})
single and double quoted values maintain whitespace from both ends (FOO="  some value  " becomes {FOO: '  some value  '})
double quoted values expand new lines (MULTILINE="new\nline" becomes

{MULTILINE: 'new
line'}


backticks are supported (BACKTICK_KEY=`This has 'single' and "double" quotes inside of it.`)

What happens to environment variables that were already set?
By default, we will never modify any environment variables that have already been set. In particular, if there is a variable in your .env file which collides with one that already exists in your environment, then that variable will be skipped.
If instead, you want to override process.env use the override option.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
How come my environment variables are not showing up for React?
Your React code is run in Webpack, where the fs module or even the process global itself are not accessible out-of-the-box. process.env can only be injected through Webpack configuration.
If you are using react-scripts, which is distributed through create-react-app, it has dotenv built in but with a quirk. Preface your environment variables with REACT_APP_. See this stack overflow for more details.
If you are using other frameworks (e.g. Next.js, Gatsby...), you need to consult their documentation for how to inject environment variables into the client.
Can I customize/write plugins for dotenv?
Yes! dotenv.config() returns an object representing the parsed .env file. This gives you everything you need to continue setting values on process.env. For example:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const variableExpansion = require('dotenv-expand')
const myEnv = dotenv.config()
variableExpansion(myEnv)
How do I use dotenv with import?
Simply..
// index.mjs (ESM)
import 'dotenv/config' // see https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#how-do-i-use-dotenv-with-import
import express from 'express'
A little background..

When you run a module containing an import declaration, the modules it imports are loaded first, then each module body is executed in a depth-first traversal of the dependency graph, avoiding cycles by skipping anything already executed.
‚Äì ES6 In Depth: Modules

What does this mean in plain language? It means you would think the following would work but it won't.
errorReporter.mjs:
class Client {
  constructor (apiKey) {
    console.log('apiKey', apiKey)

    this.apiKey = apiKey
  }
}

export default new Client(process.env.API_KEY)
index.mjs:
// Note: this is INCORRECT and will not work
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv'
dotenv.config()

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs' // process.env.API_KEY will be blank!
process.env.API_KEY will be blank.
Instead, index.mjs should be written as..
import 'dotenv/config'

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs'
Does that make sense? It's a bit unintuitive, but it is how importing of ES6 modules work. Here is a working example of this pitfall.
There are two alternatives to this approach:

Preload dotenv: node --require dotenv/config index.js (Note: you do not need to import dotenv with this approach)
Create a separate file that will execute config first as outlined in this comment on #133

Why am I getting the error Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'crypto|os|path'?
You are using dotenv on the front-end and have not included a polyfill. Webpack < 5 used to include these for you. Do the following:
npm install node-polyfill-webpack-plugin
Configure your webpack.config.js to something like the following.
require('dotenv').config()

const path = require('path');
const webpack = require('webpack')

const NodePolyfillPlugin = require('node-polyfill-webpack-plugin')

module.exports = {
  mode: 'development',
  entry: './src/index.ts',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  plugins: [
    new NodePolyfillPlugin(),
    new webpack.DefinePlugin({
      'process.env': {
        HELLO: JSON.stringify(process.env.HELLO)
      }
    }),
  ]
};
Alternatively, just use dotenv-webpack which does this and more behind the scenes for you.
What about variable expansion?
Try dotenv-expand
What about syncing and securing .env files?
Use dotenvx
What if I accidentally commit my .env file to code?
Remove it, remove git history and then install the git pre-commit hook to prevent this from ever happening again.
brew install dotenvx/brew/dotenvx
dotenvx precommit --install

How can I prevent committing my .env file to a Docker build?
Use the docker prebuild hook.
# Dockerfile
...
RUN curl -fsS https://dotenvx.sh/ | sh
...
RUN dotenvx prebuild
CMD ["dotenvx", "run", "--", "node", "index.js"]

Who's using dotenv?
These npm modules depend on it.
Projects that expand it often use the keyword "dotenv" on npm.

              No labels found. Sorry about that.
            
        
          Use alt + click/return to exclude labels.

            why not just use $ instead of (?:$|$) in the line regex?

dotenv 

Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology.

üå± Install
npm install dotenv --save
You can also use an npm-compatible package manager like yarn or bun:
yarn add dotenv
# or
bun add dotenv
üèóÔ∏è Usage






Create a .env file in the root of your project (if using a monorepo structure like apps/backend/app.js, put it in the root of the folder where your app.js process runs):
S3_BUCKET="YOURS3BUCKET"
SECRET_KEY="YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE"
As early as possible in your application, import and configure dotenv:
require('dotenv').config()
console.log(process.env) // remove this after you've confirmed it is working
.. or using ES6?
import 'dotenv/config'
That's it. process.env now has the keys and values you defined in your .env file:
require('dotenv').config()
// or import 'dotenv/config' if you're using ES6

...

s3.getBucketCors({Bucket: process.env.S3_BUCKET}, function(err, data) {})
Multiline values
If you need multiline variables, for example private keys, those are now supported (>= v15.0.0) with line breaks:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
...
Kh9NV...
...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
Alternatively, you can double quote strings and use the \n character:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nKh9NV...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
Comments
Comments may be added to your file on their own line or inline:
# This is a comment
SECRET_KEY=YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE # comment
SECRET_HASH="something-with-a-#-hash"
Comments begin where a # exists, so if your value contains a # please wrap it in quotes. This is a breaking change from >= v15.0.0 and on.
Parsing
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Preload

Note: Consider using dotenvx instead of preloading. I am now doing (and recommending) so.
It serves the same purpose (you do not need to require and load dotenv), adds better debugging, and works with ANY language, framework, or platform. ‚Äì motdotla

You can use the --require (-r) command line option to preload dotenv. By doing this, you do not need to require and load dotenv in your application code.
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
The configuration options below are supported as command line arguments in the format dotenv_config_<option>=value
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env dotenv_config_debug=true
Additionally, you can use environment variables to set configuration options. Command line arguments will precede these.
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_<OPTION>=value node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_ENCODING=latin1 DOTENV_CONFIG_DEBUG=true node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env
Variable Expansion
You need to add the value of another variable in one of your variables? Use dotenv-expand.
Command Substitution
Use dotenvx to use command substitution.
Add the output of a command to one of your variables in your .env file.
# .env
DATABASE_URL="postgres://$(whoami)@localhost/my_database"
// index.js
console.log('DATABASE_URL', process.env.DATABASE_URL)
$ dotenvx run --debug -- node index.js
[dotenvx@0.14.1] injecting env (1) from .env
DATABASE_URL postgres://yourusername@localhost/my_database
Syncing
You need to keep .env files in sync between machines, environments, or team members? Use dotenvx to encrypt your .env files and safely include them in source control. This still subscribes to the twelve-factor app rules by generating a decryption key separate from code.
Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx to generate .env.ci, .env.production files, and more.
Deploying
You need to deploy your secrets in a cloud-agnostic manner? Use dotenvx to generate a private decryption key that is set on your production server.
üå¥ Manage Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx
Run any environment locally. Create a .env.ENVIRONMENT file and use --env-file to load it. It's straightforward, yet flexible.
$ echo "HELLO=production" > .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.production -- node index.js
Hello production
> ^^
or with multiple .env files
$ echo "HELLO=local" > .env.local
$ echo "HELLO=World" > .env
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.local --env-file=.env -- node index.js
Hello local
more environment examples
üöÄ Deploying
Use dotenvx.
Add encryption to your .env files with a single command. Pass the --encrypt flag.
$ dotenvx set HELLO Production --encrypt -f .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION="<.env.production private key>" dotenvx run -- node index.js
[dotenvx] injecting env (2) from .env.production
Hello Production

üìñ Documentation
Dotenv exposes four functions:

config
parse
populate
decrypt

Config
config will read your .env file, parse the contents, assign it to
process.env,
and return an Object with a parsed key containing the loaded content or an error key if it failed.
const result = dotenv.config()

if (result.error) {
  throw result.error
}

console.log(result.parsed)
You can additionally, pass options to config.
Options
path
Default: path.resolve(process.cwd(), '.env')
Specify a custom path if your file containing environment variables is located elsewhere.
require('dotenv').config({ path: '/custom/path/to/.env' })
By default, config will look for a file called .env in the current working directory.
Pass in multiple files as an array, and they will be parsed in order and combined with process.env (or option.processEnv, if set). The first value set for a variable will win, unless the options.override flag is set, in which case the last value set will win.  If a value already exists in process.env and the options.override flag is NOT set, no changes will be made to that value.
require('dotenv').config({ path: ['.env.local', '.env'] })
encoding
Default: utf8
Specify the encoding of your file containing environment variables.
require('dotenv').config({ encoding: 'latin1' })
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
require('dotenv').config({ debug: process.env.DEBUG })
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set on your machine with values from your .env file(s). If multiple files have been provided in option.path the override will also be used as each file is combined with the next. Without override being set, the first value wins. With override set the last value wins.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
processEnv
Default: process.env
Specify an object to write your environment variables to. Defaults to process.env environment variables.
const myObject = {}
require('dotenv').config({ processEnv: myObject })

console.log(myObject) // values from .env
console.log(process.env) // this was not changed or written to
Parse
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment
variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return
an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Options
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('hello world')
const opt = { debug: true }
const config = dotenv.parse(buf, opt)
// expect a debug message because the buffer is not in KEY=VAL form
Populate
The engine which populates the contents of your .env file to process.env is available for use. It accepts a target, a source, and options. This is useful for power users who want to supply their own objects.
For example, customizing the source:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'world' }

dotenv.populate(process.env, parsed)

console.log(process.env.HELLO) // world
For example, customizing the source AND target:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'universe' }
const target = { HELLO: 'world' } // empty object

dotenv.populate(target, parsed, { override: true, debug: true })

console.log(target) // { HELLO: 'universe' }
options
Debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being populated as you expect.
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set.
‚ùì FAQ
Why is the .env file not loading my environment variables successfully?
Most likely your .env file is not in the correct place. See this stack overflow.
Turn on debug mode and try again..
require('dotenv').config({ debug: true })
You will receive a helpful error outputted to your console.
Should I commit my .env file?
No. We strongly recommend against committing your .env file to version
control. It should only include environment-specific values such as database
passwords or API keys. Your production database should have a different
password than your development database.
Should I have multiple .env files?
We recommend creating one .env file per environment. Use .env for local/development, .env.production for production and so on. This still follows the twelve factor principles as each is attributed individually to its own environment. Avoid custom set ups that work in inheritance somehow (.env.production inherits values form .env for example). It is better to duplicate values if necessary across each .env.environment file.

In a twelve-factor app, env vars are granular controls, each fully orthogonal to other env vars. They are never grouped together as ‚Äúenvironments‚Äù, but instead are independently managed for each deploy. This is a model that scales up smoothly as the app naturally expands into more deploys over its lifetime.
‚Äì The Twelve-Factor App

What rules does the parsing engine follow?
The parsing engine currently supports the following rules:

BASIC=basic becomes {BASIC: 'basic'}
empty lines are skipped
lines beginning with # are treated as comments
# marks the beginning of a comment (unless when the value is wrapped in quotes)
empty values become empty strings (EMPTY= becomes {EMPTY: ''})
inner quotes are maintained (think JSON) (JSON={"foo": "bar"} becomes {JSON:"{\"foo\": \"bar\"}")
whitespace is removed from both ends of unquoted values (see more on trim) (FOO=  some value   becomes {FOO: 'some value'})
single and double quoted values are escaped (SINGLE_QUOTE='quoted' becomes {SINGLE_QUOTE: "quoted"})
single and double quoted values maintain whitespace from both ends (FOO="  some value  " becomes {FOO: '  some value  '})
double quoted values expand new lines (MULTILINE="new\nline" becomes

{MULTILINE: 'new
line'}


backticks are supported (BACKTICK_KEY=`This has 'single' and "double" quotes inside of it.`)

What happens to environment variables that were already set?
By default, we will never modify any environment variables that have already been set. In particular, if there is a variable in your .env file which collides with one that already exists in your environment, then that variable will be skipped.
If instead, you want to override process.env use the override option.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
How come my environment variables are not showing up for React?
Your React code is run in Webpack, where the fs module or even the process global itself are not accessible out-of-the-box. process.env can only be injected through Webpack configuration.
If you are using react-scripts, which is distributed through create-react-app, it has dotenv built in but with a quirk. Preface your environment variables with REACT_APP_. See this stack overflow for more details.
If you are using other frameworks (e.g. Next.js, Gatsby...), you need to consult their documentation for how to inject environment variables into the client.
Can I customize/write plugins for dotenv?
Yes! dotenv.config() returns an object representing the parsed .env file. This gives you everything you need to continue setting values on process.env. For example:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const variableExpansion = require('dotenv-expand')
const myEnv = dotenv.config()
variableExpansion(myEnv)
How do I use dotenv with import?
Simply..
// index.mjs (ESM)
import 'dotenv/config' // see https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#how-do-i-use-dotenv-with-import
import express from 'express'
A little background..

When you run a module containing an import declaration, the modules it imports are loaded first, then each module body is executed in a depth-first traversal of the dependency graph, avoiding cycles by skipping anything already executed.
‚Äì ES6 In Depth: Modules

What does this mean in plain language? It means you would think the following would work but it won't.
errorReporter.mjs:
class Client {
  constructor (apiKey) {
    console.log('apiKey', apiKey)

    this.apiKey = apiKey
  }
}

export default new Client(process.env.API_KEY)
index.mjs:
// Note: this is INCORRECT and will not work
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv'
dotenv.config()

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs' // process.env.API_KEY will be blank!
process.env.API_KEY will be blank.
Instead, index.mjs should be written as..
import 'dotenv/config'

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs'
Does that make sense? It's a bit unintuitive, but it is how importing of ES6 modules work. Here is a working example of this pitfall.
There are two alternatives to this approach:

Preload dotenv: node --require dotenv/config index.js (Note: you do not need to import dotenv with this approach)
Create a separate file that will execute config first as outlined in this comment on #133

Why am I getting the error Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'crypto|os|path'?
You are using dotenv on the front-end and have not included a polyfill. Webpack < 5 used to include these for you. Do the following:
npm install node-polyfill-webpack-plugin
Configure your webpack.config.js to something like the following.
require('dotenv').config()

const path = require('path');
const webpack = require('webpack')

const NodePolyfillPlugin = require('node-polyfill-webpack-plugin')

module.exports = {
  mode: 'development',
  entry: './src/index.ts',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  plugins: [
    new NodePolyfillPlugin(),
    new webpack.DefinePlugin({
      'process.env': {
        HELLO: JSON.stringify(process.env.HELLO)
      }
    }),
  ]
};
Alternatively, just use dotenv-webpack which does this and more behind the scenes for you.
What about variable expansion?
Try dotenv-expand
What about syncing and securing .env files?
Use dotenvx
What if I accidentally commit my .env file to code?
Remove it, remove git history and then install the git pre-commit hook to prevent this from ever happening again.
brew install dotenvx/brew/dotenvx
dotenvx precommit --install

How can I prevent committing my .env file to a Docker build?
Use the docker prebuild hook.
# Dockerfile
...
RUN curl -fsS https://dotenvx.sh/ | sh
...
RUN dotenvx prebuild
CMD ["dotenvx", "run", "--", "node", "index.js"]

dotenv 

Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology.

üå± Install
npm install dotenv --save
You can also use an npm-compatible package manager like yarn or bun:
yarn add dotenv
# or
bun add dotenv
üèóÔ∏è Usage






Create a .env file in the root of your project (if using a monorepo structure like apps/backend/app.js, put it in the root of the folder where your app.js process runs):
S3_BUCKET="YOURS3BUCKET"
SECRET_KEY="YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE"
As early as possible in your application, import and configure dotenv:
require('dotenv').config()
console.log(process.env) // remove this after you've confirmed it is working
.. or using ES6?
import 'dotenv/config'
That's it. process.env now has the keys and values you defined in your .env file:
require('dotenv').config()
// or import 'dotenv/config' if you're using ES6

...

s3.getBucketCors({Bucket: process.env.S3_BUCKET}, function(err, data) {})
Multiline values
If you need multiline variables, for example private keys, those are now supported (>= v15.0.0) with line breaks:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
...
Kh9NV...
...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
Alternatively, you can double quote strings and use the \n character:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nKh9NV...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
Comments
Comments may be added to your file on their own line or inline:
# This is a comment
SECRET_KEY=YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE # comment
SECRET_HASH="something-with-a-#-hash"
Comments begin where a # exists, so if your value contains a # please wrap it in quotes. This is a breaking change from >= v15.0.0 and on.
Parsing
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Preload

Note: Consider using dotenvx instead of preloading. I am now doing (and recommending) so.
It serves the same purpose (you do not need to require and load dotenv), adds better debugging, and works with ANY language, framework, or platform. ‚Äì motdotla

You can use the --require (-r) command line option to preload dotenv. By doing this, you do not need to require and load dotenv in your application code.
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
The configuration options below are supported as command line arguments in the format dotenv_config_<option>=value
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env dotenv_config_debug=true
Additionally, you can use environment variables to set configuration options. Command line arguments will precede these.
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_<OPTION>=value node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_ENCODING=latin1 DOTENV_CONFIG_DEBUG=true node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env
Variable Expansion
You need to add the value of another variable in one of your variables? Use dotenv-expand.
Command Substitution
Use dotenvx to use command substitution.
Add the output of a command to one of your variables in your .env file.
# .env
DATABASE_URL="postgres://$(whoami)@localhost/my_database"
// index.js
console.log('DATABASE_URL', process.env.DATABASE_URL)
$ dotenvx run --debug -- node index.js
[dotenvx@0.14.1] injecting env (1) from .env
DATABASE_URL postgres://yourusername@localhost/my_database
Syncing
You need to keep .env files in sync between machines, environments, or team members? Use dotenvx to encrypt your .env files and safely include them in source control. This still subscribes to the twelve-factor app rules by generating a decryption key separate from code.
Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx to generate .env.ci, .env.production files, and more.
Deploying
You need to deploy your secrets in a cloud-agnostic manner? Use dotenvx to generate a private decryption key that is set on your production server.
üå¥ Manage Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx
Run any environment locally. Create a .env.ENVIRONMENT file and use --env-file to load it. It's straightforward, yet flexible.
$ echo "HELLO=production" > .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.production -- node index.js
Hello production
> ^^
or with multiple .env files
$ echo "HELLO=local" > .env.local
$ echo "HELLO=World" > .env
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.local --env-file=.env -- node index.js
Hello local
more environment examples
üöÄ Deploying
Use dotenvx.
Add encryption to your .env files with a single command. Pass the --encrypt flag.
$ dotenvx set HELLO Production --encrypt -f .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION="<.env.production private key>" dotenvx run -- node index.js
[dotenvx] injecting env (2) from .env.production
Hello Production

üìñ Documentation
Dotenv exposes four functions:

config
parse
populate
decrypt

Config
config will read your .env file, parse the contents, assign it to
process.env,
and return an Object with a parsed key containing the loaded content or an error key if it failed.
const result = dotenv.config()

if (result.error) {
  throw result.error
}

console.log(result.parsed)
You can additionally, pass options to config.
Options
path
Default: path.resolve(process.cwd(), '.env')
Specify a custom path if your file containing environment variables is located elsewhere.
require('dotenv').config({ path: '/custom/path/to/.env' })
By default, config will look for a file called .env in the current working directory.
Pass in multiple files as an array, and they will be parsed in order and combined with process.env (or option.processEnv, if set). The first value set for a variable will win, unless the options.override flag is set, in which case the last value set will win.  If a value already exists in process.env and the options.override flag is NOT set, no changes will be made to that value.
require('dotenv').config({ path: ['.env.local', '.env'] })
encoding
Default: utf8
Specify the encoding of your file containing environment variables.
require('dotenv').config({ encoding: 'latin1' })
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
require('dotenv').config({ debug: process.env.DEBUG })
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set on your machine with values from your .env file(s). If multiple files have been provided in option.path the override will also be used as each file is combined with the next. Without override being set, the first value wins. With override set the last value wins.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
processEnv
Default: process.env
Specify an object to write your environment variables to. Defaults to process.env environment variables.
const myObject = {}
require('dotenv').config({ processEnv: myObject })

console.log(myObject) // values from .env
console.log(process.env) // this was not changed or written to
Parse
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment
variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return
an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Options
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('hello world')
const opt = { debug: true }
const config = dotenv.parse(buf, opt)
// expect a debug message because the buffer is not in KEY=VAL form
Populate
The engine which populates the contents of your .env file to process.env is available for use. It accepts a target, a source, and options. This is useful for power users who want to supply their own objects.
For example, customizing the source:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'world' }

dotenv.populate(process.env, parsed)

console.log(process.env.HELLO) // world
For example, customizing the source AND target:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'universe' }
const target = { HELLO: 'world' } // empty object

dotenv.populate(target, parsed, { override: true, debug: true })

console.log(target) // { HELLO: 'universe' }
options
Debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being populated as you expect.
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set.
‚ùì FAQ
Why is the .env file not loading my environment variables successfully?
Most likely your .env file is not in the correct place. See this stack overflow.
Turn on debug mode and try again..
require('dotenv').config({ debug: true })
You will receive a helpful error outputted to your console.
Should I commit my .env file?
No. We strongly recommend against committing your .env file to version
control. It should only include environment-specific values such as database
passwords or API keys. Your production database should have a different
password than your development database.
Should I have multiple .env files?
We recommend creating one .env file per environment. Use .env for local/development, .env.production for production and so on. This still follows the twelve factor principles as each is attributed individually to its own environment. Avoid custom set ups that work in inheritance somehow (.env.production inherits values form .env for example). It is better to duplicate values if necessary across each .env.environment file.

In a twelve-factor app, env vars are granular controls, each fully orthogonal to other env vars. They are never grouped together as ‚Äúenvironments‚Äù, but instead are independently managed for each deploy. This is a model that scales up smoothly as the app naturally expands into more deploys over its lifetime.
‚Äì The Twelve-Factor App

What rules does the parsing engine follow?
The parsing engine currently supports the following rules:

BASIC=basic becomes {BASIC: 'basic'}
empty lines are skipped
lines beginning with # are treated as comments
# marks the beginning of a comment (unless when the value is wrapped in quotes)
empty values become empty strings (EMPTY= becomes {EMPTY: ''})
inner quotes are maintained (think JSON) (JSON={"foo": "bar"} becomes {JSON:"{\"foo\": \"bar\"}")
whitespace is removed from both ends of unquoted values (see more on trim) (FOO=  some value   becomes {FOO: 'some value'})
single and double quoted values are escaped (SINGLE_QUOTE='quoted' becomes {SINGLE_QUOTE: "quoted"})
single and double quoted values maintain whitespace from both ends (FOO="  some value  " becomes {FOO: '  some value  '})
double quoted values expand new lines (MULTILINE="new\nline" becomes

{MULTILINE: 'new
line'}


backticks are supported (BACKTICK_KEY=`This has 'single' and "double" quotes inside of it.`)

What happens to environment variables that were already set?
By default, we will never modify any environment variables that have already been set. In particular, if there is a variable in your .env file which collides with one that already exists in your environment, then that variable will be skipped.
If instead, you want to override process.env use the override option.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
How come my environment variables are not showing up for React?
Your React code is run in Webpack, where the fs module or even the process global itself are not accessible out-of-the-box. process.env can only be injected through Webpack configuration.
If you are using react-scripts, which is distributed through create-react-app, it has dotenv built in but with a quirk. Preface your environment variables with REACT_APP_. See this stack overflow for more details.
If you are using other frameworks (e.g. Next.js, Gatsby...), you need to consult their documentation for how to inject environment variables into the client.
Can I customize/write plugins for dotenv?
Yes! dotenv.config() returns an object representing the parsed .env file. This gives you everything you need to continue setting values on process.env. For example:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const variableExpansion = require('dotenv-expand')
const myEnv = dotenv.config()
variableExpansion(myEnv)
How do I use dotenv with import?
Simply..
// index.mjs (ESM)
import 'dotenv/config' // see https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#how-do-i-use-dotenv-with-import
import express from 'express'
A little background..

When you run a module containing an import declaration, the modules it imports are loaded first, then each module body is executed in a depth-first traversal of the dependency graph, avoiding cycles by skipping anything already executed.
‚Äì ES6 In Depth: Modules

What does this mean in plain language? It means you would think the following would work but it won't.
errorReporter.mjs:
class Client {
  constructor (apiKey) {
    console.log('apiKey', apiKey)

    this.apiKey = apiKey
  }
}

export default new Client(process.env.API_KEY)
index.mjs:
// Note: this is INCORRECT and will not work
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv'
dotenv.config()

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs' // process.env.API_KEY will be blank!
process.env.API_KEY will be blank.
Instead, index.mjs should be written as..
import 'dotenv/config'

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs'
Does that make sense? It's a bit unintuitive, but it is how importing of ES6 modules work. Here is a working example of this pitfall.
There are two alternatives to this approach:

Preload dotenv: node --require dotenv/config index.js (Note: you do not need to import dotenv with this approach)
Create a separate file that will execute config first as outlined in this comment on #133

Why am I getting the error Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'crypto|os|path'?
You are using dotenv on the front-end and have not included a polyfill. Webpack < 5 used to include these for you. Do the following:
npm install node-polyfill-webpack-plugin
Configure your webpack.config.js to something like the following.
require('dotenv').config()

const path = require('path');
const webpack = require('webpack')

const NodePolyfillPlugin = require('node-polyfill-webpack-plugin')

module.exports = {
  mode: 'development',
  entry: './src/index.ts',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  plugins: [
    new NodePolyfillPlugin(),
    new webpack.DefinePlugin({
      'process.env': {
        HELLO: JSON.stringify(process.env.HELLO)
      }
    }),
  ]
};
Alternatively, just use dotenv-webpack which does this and more behind the scenes for you.
What about variable expansion?
Try dotenv-expand
What about syncing and securing .env files?
Use dotenvx
What if I accidentally commit my .env file to code?
Remove it, remove git history and then install the git pre-commit hook to prevent this from ever happening again.
brew install dotenvx/brew/dotenvx
dotenvx precommit --install

How can I prevent committing my .env file to a Docker build?
Use the docker prebuild hook.
# Dockerfile
...
RUN curl -fsS https://dotenvx.sh/ | sh
...
RUN dotenvx prebuild
CMD ["dotenvx", "run", "--", "node", "index.js"]

Who's using dotenv?
These npm modules depend on it.
Projects that expand it often use the keyword "dotenv" on npm.

Variable Expansion
Reference and expand variables already on your machine for use in your .env file.
# .env
USERNAME="username"
DATABASE_URL="postgres://${USERNAME}@localhost/my_database"
// index.js
console.log('DATABASE_URL', process.env.DATABASE_URL)
$ dotenvx run --debug -- node index.js
[dotenvx@0.14.1] injecting env (2) from .env
DATABASE_URL postgres://username@localhost/my_database



Command Substitution
Add the output of a command to one of your variables in your .env file.
# .env
DATABASE_URL="postgres://$(whoami)@localhost/my_database"
// index.js
console.log('DATABASE_URL', process.env.DATABASE_URL)
$ dotenvx run --debug -- node index.js
[dotenvx@0.14.1] injecting env (1) from .env

Multiple Environments

Create a .env.production file and use -f to load it. It's straightforward, yet flexible.

$ echo "HELLO=production" > .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run -f .env.production -- node index.js
[dotenvx@1.X.X] injecting env (1) from .env.production
Hello production
> ^^
More examples


multiple `.env` files
$ echo "HELLO=local" > .env.local

$ echo "HELLO=World" > .env

$ dotenvx run -f .env.local -f .env -- node index.js
[dotenvx@1.X.X] injecting env (1) from .env.local,.env
Hello local
Note subsequent files do NOT override pre-existing variables defined in previous files or env. This follows historic principle. For example, above local wins ‚Äì from the first file.



`--overload` flag
$ echo "HELLO=local" > .env.local

$ echo "HELLO=World" > .env

$ dotenvx run -f .env.local -f .env --overload -- node index.js
[dotenvx@1.X.X] injecting env (1) from .env.local,.env
Hello World
Note that with --overload subsequent files DO override pre-existing variables defined in previous files.


`--verbose` flag
$ echo "HELLO=production" > .env.production

$ dotenvx run -f .env.production --verbose -- node index.js
[dotenvx][verbose] injecting env from /path/to/.env.production
[dotenvx][verbose] HELLO set
[dotenvx@1.X.X] injecting env (1) from .env.production
Hello production


`--debug` flag
$ echo "HELLO=production" > .env.production

$ dotenvx run -f .env.production --debug -- node index.js
[dotenvx][debug] configuring options
[dotenvx][debug] {"envFile":[".env.production"]}
[dotenvx][verbose] injecting env from /path/to/.env.production
[dotenvx][debug] reading env from /path/to/.env.production
[dotenvx][debug] parsing env from /path/to/.env.production
[dotenvx][debug] {"HELLO":"production"}
[dotenvx][debug] writing env from /path/to/.env.production
[dotenvx][verbose] HELLO set
[dotenvx][debug] HELLO set to production
[dotenvx@1.X.X] injecting env (1) from .env.production
Hello production



`--quiet` flag
Use --quiet to suppress all output (except errors).
$ echo "HELLO=production" > .env.production

$ dotenvx run -f .env.production --quiet -- node index.js
Hello production



`--log-level` flag
Set --log-level to whatever you wish. For example, to suppress warnings (risky), set log level to error:
$ echo "HELLO=production" > .env.production

$ dotenvx run -f .env.production --log-level=error -- node index.js
Hello production
Available log levels are error, warn, info, verbose, debug, silly



`--convention` flag
Load envs using Next.js' convention or dotenv-flow convention. Set --convention to nextjs or flow:
$ echo "HELLO=development local" > .env.development.local
$ echo "HELLO=local" > .env.local
$ echo "HELLO=development" > .env.development
$ echo "HELLO=env" > .env

$ dotenvx run --convention=nextjs -- node index.js
Hello development local

$ dotenvx run --convention=flow -- node index.js
Hello development local
(more conventions available upon request)



¬†
Encryption

Add encryption to your .env files with a single command. Use dotenvx encrypt.

$ dotenvx encrypt
‚úî encrypted (.env)


A DOTENV_PUBLIC_KEY (encryption key) and a DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY (decryption key) are generated using the same public-key cryptography as Bitcoin.

More examples


`.env`
$ echo "HELLO=World" > .env
$ dotenvx encrypt
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run -- node index.js
[dotenvx@1.X.X] injecting env (2) from .env
Hello World



`.env.production`
$ echo "HELLO=Production" > .env.production
$ dotenvx encrypt -f .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION="<.env.production private key>" dotenvx run -- node index.js
[dotenvx@1.X.X] injecting env (2) from .env.production
Hello Production
Note the DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION ends with _PRODUCTION. This instructs dotenvx run to load the .env.production file.



`.env.ci`
$ echo "HELLO=Ci" > .env.ci
$ dotenvx encrypt -f .env.ci
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_CI="<.env.ci private key>" dotenvx run -- node index.js
[dotenvx@1.X.X] injecting env (2) from .env.ci
Hello Ci
Note the DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_CI ends with _CI. This instructs dotenvx run to load the .env.ci file. See the pattern?



combine multiple encrypted .env files
$ dotenvx set HELLO World -f .env
$ dotenvx set HELLO Production -f .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY="<.env private key>" DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION="<.env.production private key>" dotenvx run -- node index.js
[dotenvx@1.X.X] injecting env (3) from .env, .env.production
Hello World
Note the DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY instructs dotenvx run to load the .env file and the DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION instructs it to load the .env.production file. See the pattern?



combine multiple encrypted .env files for monorepo
$ mkdir app1
$ mkdir app2
$ dotenvx set HELLO app1 -f app1/.env.ci
$ dotenvx set HELLO app2 -f app2/.env.ci
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_CI="<app1/privat ci key>,<app2/private ci key>" dotenvx run -f app1/.env.ci -f app2/.env.ci -- node index.js
[dotenvx@1.X.X] injecting env (2) from app1/.env.ci,app2/.env.ci
Hello app1

$ DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_CI="<app1/privat ci key>,<app2/private ci key>" dotenvx run -f app1/.env.ci -f app2/.env.ci --overload -- node index.js
[dotenvx@1.X.X] injecting env (2) from app1/.env.ci,app2/.env.ci
Hello app2
Note the DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_CI (and any DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY*) can take multiple private keys by simply comma separating them.



`--stdout`
$ echo "HELLO=World" > .env
$ dotenvx encrypt --stdout
$ dotenvx encrypt --stdout > .env.encrypted



other curves

secp256k1 is a well-known and battle tested curve, in use with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but we are open to adding support for more curves.

# .env
USERNAME="username"
DATABASE_URL="postgres://${USERNAME}@localhost/my_database"
// index.js
console.log('DATABASE_URL', process.env.DATABASE_URL)
$ dotenvx run --debug -- node index.js
[dotenvx@1.X.X] injecting env (2) from .env

# .env
DATABASE_URL="postgres://$(whoami)@localhost/my_database"
// index.js
console.log('DATABASE_URL', process.env.DATABASE_URL)
$ dotenvx run --debug -- node index.js
[dotenvx@1.X.X] injecting env (1) from .env
DATABASE_URL postgres://yourusername@localhost/my_database



`run` - Shell Expansion
Prevent your shell from expanding inline $VARIABLES before dotenvx has a chance to inject it. Use a subshell.
$ dotenvx run --env="HELLO=World" -- sh -c 'echo Hello $HELLO'
Hello World



`run` - Multiline
Dotenvx supports multiline values. This is particularly useful in conjunction with Docker - which does not support multiline values.
# .env

`run` - Contextual Help
Unlike other dotenv libraries, dotenvx attempts to unblock you with contextual help.
For example, when missing a custom .env file:
$ dotenvx run -f .env.missing -- echo $HELLO
[MISSING_ENV_FILE] missing .env.missing file (/Users/scottmotte/Code/dotenvx/playground/apr-16/.env.missing)
[MISSING_ENV_FILE] https://github.com/dotenvx/dotenvx/issues/484 and re-run [dotenvx run -- echo]
or when missing a KEY:
$ echo "HELLO=World" > .env
$ dotenvx get GOODBYE
[MISSING_KEY] missing GOODBYE key



`run` - multiple `-f` flags
Compose multiple .env files for environment variables loading, as you need.
$ echo "HELLO=local" > .env.local
$ echo "HELLO=World" > .env
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run -f .env.local -f .env -- node index.js
[dotenvx@1.X.X] injecting env (1) from .env.local, .env
Hello local
Note subsequent files do NOT override pre-existing variables defined in previous files or env. This follows historic principle. For example, above local wins ‚Äì from the first file.



`run --env HELLO=String`
Set environment variables as a simple KEY=value string pair.
$ echo "HELLO=World" > .env
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env HELLO=String -f .env -- node index.js
[dotenvx@1.X.X] injecting env (1) from .env, and --env flag
Hello String



`run --overload`
Override existing env variables. These can be variables already on your machine or variables loaded as files consecutively. The last variable seen will 'win'.
$ echo "HELLO=local" > .env.local
$ echo "HELLO=World" > .env
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run -f .env.local -f .env --overload -- node index.js
[dotenvx@1.X.X] injecting env (1) from .env.local, .env
Hello World
Note that with --overload subsequent files DO override pre-existing variables defined in previous files.



`DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY=key run`
Decrypt your encrypted .env by setting DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY before dotenvx run.
$ touch .env
$ dotenvx set HELLO encrypted
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

# check your .env.keys files for your privateKey
$ DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY="122...0b8" dotenvx run -- node index.js
[dotenvx@1.X.X] injecting env (2) from .env
Hello encrypted



`DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION=key run`
Decrypt your encrypted .env.production by setting DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION before dotenvx run. Alternatively, this can be already set on your server or cloud provider.
$ touch .env.production
$ dotenvx set HELLO "production encrypted" -f .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

# check .env.keys for your privateKey
$ DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION="122...0b8" dotenvx run -- node index.js
[dotenvx@1.X.X] injecting env (2) from .env.production
Hello production encrypted
Note the DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION ends with _PRODUCTION. This instructs dotenvx run to load the .env.production file.



`DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_CI=key dotenvx run`
Decrypt your encrypted .env.ci by setting DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_CI before dotenvx run. Alternatively, this can be already set on your server or cloud provider.
$ touch .env.ci
$ dotenvx set HELLO "ci encrypted" -f .env.ci
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

# check .env.keys for your privateKey
$ DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_CI="122...0b8" dotenvx run -- node index.js
[dotenvx@1.X.X] injecting env (2) from .env.ci
Hello ci encrypted
Note the DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_CI ends with _CI. This instructs dotenvx run to load the .env.ci file. See the pattern?



`DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY=key DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION=key run` - Combine Multiple
Decrypt your encrypted .env and .env.production files by setting DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY and DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION before dotenvx run.
$ touch .env
$ touch .env.production
$ dotenvx set HELLO encrypted
$ dotenvx set HELLO "production encrypted" -f .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

# check .env.keys for your privateKeys
$ DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY="122...0b8" DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION="122...0b8" dotenvx run -- node index.js
[dotenvx@1.X.X] injecting env (3) from .env, .env.production
Hello encrypted

$ DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION="122...0b8" DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY="122...0b8" dotenvx run -- node index.js
[dotenvx@1.X.X] injecting env (3) from .env.production, .env
Hello production encrypted
Compose any encrypted files you want this way. As long as a DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_${environment} is set, the values from .env.${environment} will be decrypted at runtime.



`run --verbose`
Set log level to verbose. (log levels)
$ echo "HELLO=production" > .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run -f .env.production --verbose -- node index.js
loading env from .env.production (/path/to/.env.production)
HELLO set
[dotenvx@1.X.X] injecting env (1) from .env.production
Hello production



`run --debug`
Set log level to debug. (log levels)
$ echo "HELLO=production" > .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run -f .env.production --debug -- node index.js
process command [node index.js]
options: {"env":[],"envFile":[".env.production"]}
loading env from .env.production (/path/to/.env.production)

Use --quiet to suppress all output (except errors). (log levels)
$ echo "HELLO=production" > .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run -f .env.production --quiet -- node index.js
Hello production



`run --log-level`
Set --log-level to whatever you wish. For example, to suppress warnings (risky), set log level to error:
$ echo "HELLO=production" > .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run -f .env.production --log-level=error -- node index.js
Hello production
Available log levels are error, warn, info, verbose, debug, silly (source)



`run --strict`

Be careful with eval as it allows for arbitrary execution of commands. Prefer dotenvx run -- but in some cases eval is a sharp knife that is useful to have.



`get --all`
Return preset machine envs as well.

`config(strict: true)` - strict
Use strict to throw if an error is encountered - like a missing .env file.
# .env
HELLO="World"
// index.js
require('@dotenvx/dotenvx').config({path: ['.env.missing', '.env'], strict: true})

console.log(`Hello ${process.env.HELLO}`)
$ node index.js
Error: [MISSING_ENV_FILE] missing .env.missing file (/path/to/.env.missing)



`config(ignore:)` - ignore
Use ignore to suppress specific errors like MISSING_ENV_FILE.
# .env
HELLO="World"
// index.js
require('@dotenvx/dotenvx').config({path: ['.env.missing', '.env'], ignore: ['MISSING_ENV_FILE']})

console.log(`Hello ${process.env.HELLO}`)
$ node index.js
[dotenvx@1.X.X] injecting env (1) from .env
Hello World



`config(envKeysFile:)` - envKeysFile
Use envKeysFile to customize the path to your .env.keys file. This is useful with monorepos.
# .env
HELLO="World"
// index.js
require('@dotenvx/dotenvx').config({path: ['.env'], envKeysFile: '../../.env.keys'})



`parse(src)`
Parse a .env string directly in node.js code.
// index.js
const dotenvx = require('@dotenvx/dotenvx')
const src = 'HELLO=World'
const parsed = dotenvx.parse(src)
console.log(`Hello ${parsed.HELLO}`)
$ node index.js
Hello World



`parse(src, {processEnv:})`
Sometimes, you want to run parse without it accessing process.env. (You can pass a fake processEnv this way as well - sometimes useful.)
// index.js
const dotenvx = require('@dotenvx/dotenvx')
const src = 'USER=Me'
const parsed = dotenvx.parse(src, { processEnv: {} })
console.log(`Hello ${parsed.USER}`)
$ node index.js
Hello Me



`parse(src, {privateKey:})`
Decrypt an encrypted .env string with privateKey.
// index.js
const dotenvx = require('@dotenvx/dotenvx')
const src = 'HELLO="encrypted:BE9Y7LKANx77X1pv1HnEoil93fPa5c9rpL/1ps48uaRT9zM8VR6mHx9yM+HktKdsPGIZELuZ7rr2mn1gScsmWitppAgE/1lVprNYBCqiYeaTcKXjDUXU5LfsEsflnAsDhT/kWG1l"'
const parsed = dotenvx.parse(src, { privateKey: 'a4547dcd9d3429615a3649bb79e87edb62ee6a74b007075e9141ae44f5fb412c' })
console.log(`Hello ${parsed.HELLO}`)
$ node index.js
Hello World



`set(KEY, value)`
Programmatically set an environment variable.
// index.js
const dotenvx = require('@dotenvx/dotenvx')
dotenvx.set('HELLO', 'World', { path: '.env' })



`get(KEY)` - Decryption at Access
Programmatically get an environment variable at access/runtime.
// index.js
const dotenvx = require('@dotenvx/dotenvx')
const decryptedValue = dotenvx.get('HELLO')
console.log(decryptedValue)
This is known as Decryption at Access and is written about in the whitepaper.

Whitepaper

Dotenvx: Reducing Secrets Risk with Cryptographic Separation
Abstract. An ideal secrets solution would not only centralize secrets but also contain the fallout of a breach. While secrets managers offer centralized storage and distribution, their design creates a large blast radius, risking exposure of thousands or even millions of secrets. We propose a solution that reduces the blast radius by splitting secrets management into two distinct components: an encrypted secrets file and a separate decryption key.

FAQ
How does encryption work?
Dotenvx uses Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme (ECIES) to encrypt each secret with a unique ephemeral key, while ensuring it can be decrypted using a long-term private key.
When you initialize encryption, a DOTENV_PUBLIC_KEY (encryption key) and DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY (decryption key) are generated. The DOTENV_PUBLIC_KEY is used to encrypt secrets, and the DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY is securely stored in your cloud secrets manager or .env.keys file.
Your encrypted .env file is then safely committed to code. Even if the file is exposed, secrets remain protected since decryption requires the separate DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY, which is never stored alongside it. Read the whitepaper for more details.
Is it safe to commit an encrypted .env file to code?
Yes. Dotenvx encrypts secrets using AES-256 with ephemeral keys, ensuring that even if the encrypted .env file is exposed, its contents remain secure. The encryption keys themselves are protected using Secp256k1 elliptic curve cryptography, which is widely used for secure key exchange in technologies like Bitcoin.
This means that every secret in the .env file is encrypted with a unique AES-256 key, and that key is further encrypted using a public key (Secp256k1). Even if an attacker obtains the encrypted .env file, they would still need the corresponding private key‚Äîstored separately in a secrets manager‚Äîto decrypt anything.
Breaking this encryption would require brute-forcing both AES-256 and elliptic curve cryptography, which is computationally infeasible with current technology. Read the whitepaper for more details.
Why am I getting the error node: .env: not found?
You are using Node 20 or greater and it adds a differing implementation of --env-file flag support. Rather than warn on a missing .env file (like dotenv has historically done), it raises an error: node: .env: not found.
This fix is easy. Replace --env-file with -f.
# from this:
./node_modules/.bin/dotenvx run --env-file .env -- yourcommand
# to this:
./node_modules/.bin/dotenvx run -f .env -- yourcommand
more context
What happened to the .env.vault file?
I've decided we should sunset it as a technological solution to this.
The .env.vault file got us far, but it had limitations such as:

Pull Requests - it was difficult to tell which key had been changed
Security - there was no mechanism to give a teammate the ability to encrypt without also giving them the ability to decrypt. Sometimes you just want to let a contractor encrypt a new value, but you don't want them to know the rest of the secrets.
Conceptual - it takes more mental energy to understand the .env.vault format. Encrypted values inside a .env file is easier to quickly grasp.
Combining Multiple Files - there was simply no mechanism to do this well with the .env.vault file format.

That said, the .env.vault tooling will still stick around for at least 1 year under dotenvx vault parent command. I'm still using it in projects as are many thousands of other people.
How do I migrate my .env.vault file(s) to encrypted .env files?
Run $ dotenvx ext vault migrate and follow the instructions.

Encryption

Add encryption to your .env files with a single command. Use dotenvx encrypt.

$ dotenvx encrypt
‚úî encrypted (.env)


A DOTENV_PUBLIC_KEY (encryption key) and a DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY (decryption key) are generated using the same public-key cryptography as Bitcoin.

More examples


`.env`
$ echo "HELLO=World" > .env
$ dotenvx encrypt
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

Advanced CLI commands.


`run` - Variable Expansion
Reference and expand variables already on your machine for use in your .env file.
# .env
USERNAME="username"
DATABASE_URL="postgres://${USERNAME}@localhost/my_database"
// index.js
console.log('DATABASE_URL', process.env.DATABASE_URL)
$ dotenvx run --debug -- node index.js
[dotenvx@1.X.X] injecting env (2) from .env
DATABASE_URL postgres://username@localhost/my_database



`run` - Command Substitution
Add the output of a command to one of your variables in your .env file.
# .env
DATABASE_URL="postgres://$(whoami)@localhost/my_database"
// index.js
console.log('DATABASE_URL', process.env.DATABASE_URL)
$ dotenvx run --debug -- node index.js
[dotenvx@1.X.X] injecting env (1) from .env
DATABASE_URL postgres://yourusername@localhost/my_database



`run` - Shell Expansion
Prevent your shell from expanding inline $VARIABLES before dotenvx has a chance to inject it. Use a subshell.
$ dotenvx run --env="HELLO=World" -- sh -c 'echo Hello $HELLO'
Hello World



`run` - Multiline
Dotenvx supports multiline values. This is particularly useful in conjunction with Docker - which does not support multiline values.
# .env

`run` - Contextual Help
Unlike other dotenv libraries, dotenvx attempts to unblock you with contextual help.
For example, when missing a custom .env file:
$ dotenvx run -f .env.missing -- echo $HELLO
[MISSING_ENV_FILE] missing .env.missing file (/Users/scottmotte/Code/dotenvx/playground/apr-16/.env.missing)
[MISSING_ENV_FILE] https://github.com/dotenvx/dotenvx/issues/484 and re-run [dotenvx run -- echo]
or when missing a KEY:
$ echo "HELLO=World" > .env
$ dotenvx get GOODBYE
[MISSING_KEY] missing GOODBYE key



`run` - multiple `-f` flags
Compose multiple .env files for environment variables loading, as you need.
$ echo "HELLO=local" > .env.local
$ echo "HELLO=World" > .env
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run -f .env.local -f .env -- node index.js
[dotenvx@1.X.X] injecting env (1) from .env.local, .env
Hello local
Note subsequent files do NOT override pre-existing variables defined in previous files or env. This follows historic principle. For example, above local wins ‚Äì from the first file.



`run --env HELLO=String`
Set environment variables as a simple KEY=value string pair.
$ echo "HELLO=World" > .env
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env HELLO=String -f .env -- node index.js
[dotenvx@1.X.X] injecting env (1) from .env, and --env flag
Hello String



`run --overload`
Override existing env variables. These can be variables already on your machine or variables loaded as files consecutively. The last variable seen will 'win'.
$ echo "HELLO=local" > .env.local
$ echo "HELLO=World" > .env
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run -f .env.local -f .env --overload -- node index.js
[dotenvx@1.X.X] injecting env (1) from .env.local, .env
Hello World
Note that with --overload subsequent files DO override pre-existing variables defined in previous files.



`DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY=key run`
Decrypt your encrypted .env by setting DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY before dotenvx run.
$ touch .env
$ dotenvx set HELLO encrypted
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

# check your .env.keys files for your privateKey
$ DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY="122...0b8" dotenvx run -- node index.js
[dotenvx@1.X.X] injecting env (2) from .env
Hello encrypted



`DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION=key run`
Decrypt your encrypted .env.production by setting DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION before dotenvx run. Alternatively, this can be already set on your server or cloud provider.
$ touch .env.production
$ dotenvx set HELLO "production encrypted" -f .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

# check .env.keys for your privateKey
$ DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION="122...0b8" dotenvx run -- node index.js
[dotenvx@1.X.X] injecting env (2) from .env.production
Hello production encrypted
Note the DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION ends with _PRODUCTION. This instructs dotenvx run to load the .env.production file.



`DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_CI=key dotenvx run`
Decrypt your encrypted .env.ci by setting DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_CI before dotenvx run. Alternatively, this can be already set on your server or cloud provider.
$ touch .env.ci
$ dotenvx set HELLO "ci encrypted" -f .env.ci
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

# check .env.keys for your privateKey

[dotenvx@1.X.X] injecting env (2) from .env.ci
Hello ci encrypted
Note the DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_CI ends with _CI. This instructs dotenvx run to load the .env.ci file. See the pattern?



`DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY=key DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION=key run` - Combine Multiple
Decrypt your encrypted .env and .env.production files by setting DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY and DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION before dotenvx run.
$ touch .env
$ touch .env.production
$ dotenvx set HELLO encrypted
$ dotenvx set HELLO "production encrypted" -f .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

# check .env.keys for your privateKeys
$ DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY="122...0b8" DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION="122...0b8" dotenvx run -- node index.js
[dotenvx@1.X.X] injecting env (3) from .env, .env.production
Hello encrypted

$ DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION="122...0b8" DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY="122...0b8" dotenvx run -- node index.js
[dotenvx@1.X.X] injecting env (3) from .env.production, .env
Hello production encrypted
Compose any encrypted files you want this way. As long as a DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_${environment} is set, the values from .env.${environment} will be decrypted at runtime.

Library üì¶
Use dotenvx directly in code.


`config()`
Use directly in node.js code.
# .env
HELLO="World"
// index.js
require('@dotenvx/dotenvx').config()

console.log(`Hello ${process.env.HELLO}`)
$ node index.js
[dotenvx@1.X.X] injecting env (1) from .env
Hello World
It defaults to looking for a .env file.



`config(path: ['.env.local', '.env'])` - multiple files
Specify path(s) to multiple .env files.
# .env.local
HELLO="Me"
# .env
HELLO="World"
// index.js
require('@dotenvx/dotenvx').config({path: ['.env.local', '.env']})

console.log(`Hello ${process.env.HELLO}`)
$ node index.js
[dotenvx@1.X.X] injecting env (1) from .env.local, .env
Hello Me



`config(overload: true)` - overload
Use overload to overwrite the prior set value.
# .env.local
HELLO="Me"
# .env
HELLO="World"
// index.js
require('@dotenvx/dotenvx').config({path: ['.env.local', '.env'], overload: true})

console.log(`Hello ${process.env.HELLO}`)
$ node index.js
[dotenvx@1.X.X] injecting env (1) from .env.local, .env
Hello World



`config(strict: true)` - strict
Use strict to throw if an error is encountered - like a missing .env file.
# .env
HELLO="World"
// index.js
require('@dotenvx/dotenvx').config({path: ['.env.missing', '.env'], strict: true})

console.log(`Hello ${process.env.HELLO}`)
$ node index.js
Error: [MISSING_ENV_FILE] missing .env.missing file (/path/to/.env.missing)



`config(ignore:)` - ignore
Use ignore to suppress specific errors like MISSING_ENV_FILE.
# .env
HELLO="World"
// index.js
require('@dotenvx/dotenvx').config({path: ['.env.missing', '.env'], ignore: ['MISSING_ENV_FILE']})

console.log(`Hello ${process.env.HELLO}`)
$ node index.js
[dotenvx@1.X.X] injecting env (1) from .env
Hello World



`config(envKeysFile:)` - envKeysFile
Use envKeysFile to customize the path to your .env.keys file. This is useful with monorepos.
# .env
HELLO="World"
// index.js
require('@dotenvx/dotenvx').config({path: ['.env'], envKeysFile: '../../.env.keys'})



`parse(src)`
Parse a .env string directly in node.js code.
// index.js
const dotenvx = require('@dotenvx/dotenvx')
const src = 'HELLO=World'
const parsed = dotenvx.parse(src)
console.log(`Hello ${parsed.HELLO}`)
$ node index.js
Hello World



`parse(src, {processEnv:})`
Sometimes, you want to run parse without it accessing process.env. (You can pass a fake processEnv this way as well - sometimes useful.)
// index.js
const dotenvx = require('@dotenvx/dotenvx')
const src = 'USER=Me'
const parsed = dotenvx.parse(src, { processEnv: {} })
console.log(`Hello ${parsed.USER}`)
$ node index.js
Hello Me



`parse(src, {privateKey:})`
Decrypt an encrypted .env string with privateKey.
// index.js
const dotenvx = require('@dotenvx/dotenvx')
const src = 'HELLO="encrypted:BE9Y7LKANx77X1pv1HnEoil93fPa5c9rpL/1ps48uaRT9zM8VR6mHx9yM+HktKdsPGIZELuZ7rr2mn1gScsmWitppAgE/1lVprNYBCqiYeaTcKXjDUXU5LfsEsflnAsDhT/kWG1l"'
const parsed = dotenvx.parse(src, { privateKey: 'a4547dcd9d3429615a3649bb79e87edb62ee6a74b007075e9141ae44f5fb412c' })
console.log(`Hello ${parsed.HELLO}`)
$ node index.js
Hello World



`set(KEY, value)`
Programmatically set an environment variable.
// index.js
const dotenvx = require('@dotenvx/dotenvx')
dotenvx.set('HELLO', 'World', { path: '.env' })



`get(KEY)` - Decryption at Access
Programmatically get an environment variable at access/runtime.
// index.js
const dotenvx = require('@dotenvx/dotenvx')
const decryptedValue = dotenvx.get('HELLO')
console.log(decryptedValue)
This is known as Decryption at Access and is written about in the whitepaper.

Whitepaper

Dotenvx: Reducing Secrets Risk with Cryptographic Separation
Abstract. An ideal secrets solution would not only centralize secrets but also contain the fallout of a breach. While secrets managers offer centralized storage and distribution, their design creates a large blast radius, risking exposure of thousands or even millions of secrets. We propose a solution that reduces the blast radius by splitting secrets management into two distinct components: an encrypted secrets file and a separate decryption key.

FAQ
How does encryption work?
Dotenvx uses Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme (ECIES) to encrypt each secret with a unique ephemeral key, while ensuring it can be decrypted using a long-term private key.
When you initialize encryption, a DOTENV_PUBLIC_KEY (encryption key) and DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY (decryption key) are generated. The DOTENV_PUBLIC_KEY is used to encrypt secrets, and the DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY is securely stored in your cloud secrets manager or .env.keys file.
Your encrypted .env file is then safely committed to code. Even if the file is exposed, secrets remain protected since decryption requires the separate DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY, which is never stored alongside it. Read the whitepaper for more details.
Is it safe to commit an encrypted .env file to code?
Yes. Dotenvx encrypts secrets using AES-256 with ephemeral keys, ensuring that even if the encrypted .env file is exposed, its contents remain secure. The encryption keys themselves are protected using Secp256k1 elliptic curve cryptography, which is widely used for secure key exchange in technologies like Bitcoin.
This means that every secret in the .env file is encrypted with a unique AES-256 key, and that key is further encrypted using a public key (Secp256k1). Even if an attacker obtains the encrypted .env file, they would still need the corresponding private key‚Äîstored separately in a secrets manager‚Äîto decrypt anything.
Breaking this encryption would require brute-forcing both AES-256 and elliptic curve cryptography, which is computationally infeasible with current technology. Read the whitepaper for more details.
Why am I getting the error node: .env: not found?
You are using Node 20 or greater and it adds a differing implementation of --env-file flag support. Rather than warn on a missing .env file (like dotenv has historically done), it raises an error: node: .env: not found.
This fix is easy. Replace --env-file with -f.
# from this:
./node_modules/.bin/dotenvx run --env-file .env -- yourcommand
# to this:
./node_modules/.bin/dotenvx run -f .env -- yourcommand
more context
What happened to the .env.vault file?
I've decided we should sunset it as a technological solution to this.
The .env.vault file got us far, but it had limitations such as:

Pull Requests - it was difficult to tell which key had been changed
Security - there was no mechanism to give a teammate the ability to encrypt without also giving them the ability to decrypt. Sometimes you just want to let a contractor encrypt a new value, but you don't want them to know the rest of the secrets.
Conceptual - it takes more mental energy to understand the .env.vault format. Encrypted values inside a .env file is easier to quickly grasp.
Combining Multiple Files - there was simply no mechanism to do this well with the .env.vault file format.

That said, the .env.vault tooling will still stick around for at least 1 year under dotenvx vault parent command. I'm still using it in projects as are many thousands of other people.
How do I migrate my .env.vault file(s) to encrypted .env files?
Run $ dotenvx ext vault migrate and follow the instructions.

dotenv 

Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology.

üå± Install
npm install dotenv --save
You can also use an npm-compatible package manager like yarn or bun:
yarn add dotenv
# or
bun add dotenv
üèóÔ∏è Usage






Create a .env file in the root of your project (if using a monorepo structure like apps/backend/app.js, put it in the root of the folder where your app.js process runs):
S3_BUCKET="YOURS3BUCKET"
SECRET_KEY="YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE"
As early as possible in your application, import and configure dotenv:
require('dotenv').config()
console.log(process.env) // remove this after you've confirmed it is working
.. or using ES6?
import 'dotenv/config'
That's it. process.env now has the keys and values you defined in your .env file:
require('dotenv').config()
// or import 'dotenv/config' if you're using ES6

...

s3.getBucketCors({Bucket: process.env.S3_BUCKET}, function(err, data) {})
Multiline values
If you need multiline variables, for example private keys, those are now supported (>= v15.0.0) with line breaks:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
...
Kh9NV...
...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
Alternatively, you can double quote strings and use the \n character:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nKh9NV...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
Comments
Comments may be added to your file on their own line or inline:
# This is a comment
SECRET_KEY=YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE # comment
SECRET_HASH="something-with-a-#-hash"
Comments begin where a # exists, so if your value contains a # please wrap it in quotes. This is a breaking change from >= v15.0.0 and on.
Parsing
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Preload

Note: Consider using dotenvx instead of preloading. I am now doing (and recommending) so.
It serves the same purpose (you do not need to require and load dotenv), adds better debugging, and works with ANY language, framework, or platform. ‚Äì motdotla

You can use the --require (-r) command line option to preload dotenv. By doing this, you do not need to require and load dotenv in your application code.
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
The configuration options below are supported as command line arguments in the format dotenv_config_<option>=value
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env dotenv_config_debug=true
Additionally, you can use environment variables to set configuration options. Command line arguments will precede these.
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_<OPTION>=value node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_ENCODING=latin1 DOTENV_CONFIG_DEBUG=true node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env
Variable Expansion
You need to add the value of another variable in one of your variables? Use dotenv-expand.
Command Substitution
Use dotenvx to use command substitution.
Add the output of a command to one of your variables in your .env file.
# .env
DATABASE_URL="postgres://$(whoami)@localhost/my_database"
// index.js
console.log('DATABASE_URL', process.env.DATABASE_URL)
$ dotenvx run --debug -- node index.js
[dotenvx@0.14.1] injecting env (1) from .env
DATABASE_URL postgres://yourusername@localhost/my_database
Syncing
You need to keep .env files in sync between machines, environments, or team members? Use dotenvx to encrypt your .env files and safely include them in source control. This still subscribes to the twelve-factor app rules by generating a decryption key separate from code.
Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx to generate .env.ci, .env.production files, and more.
Deploying
You need to deploy your secrets in a cloud-agnostic manner? Use dotenvx to generate a private decryption key that is set on your production server.
üå¥ Manage Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx
Run any environment locally. Create a .env.ENVIRONMENT file and use --env-file to load it. It's straightforward, yet flexible.
$ echo "HELLO=production" > .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.production -- node index.js
Hello production
> ^^
or with multiple .env files
$ echo "HELLO=local" > .env.local
$ echo "HELLO=World" > .env
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.local --env-file=.env -- node index.js
Hello local
more environment examples
üöÄ Deploying
Use dotenvx.
Add encryption to your .env files with a single command. Pass the --encrypt flag.
$ dotenvx set HELLO Production --encrypt -f .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION="<.env.production private key>" dotenvx run -- node index.js
[dotenvx] injecting env (2) from .env.production
Hello Production

üìñ Documentation
Dotenv exposes four functions:

config
parse
populate
decrypt

Config
config will read your .env file, parse the contents, assign it to
process.env,
and return an Object with a parsed key containing the loaded content or an error key if it failed.
const result = dotenv.config()

if (result.error) {
  throw result.error
}

console.log(result.parsed)
You can additionally, pass options to config.
Options
path
Default: path.resolve(process.cwd(), '.env')
Specify a custom path if your file containing environment variables is located elsewhere.
require('dotenv').config({ path: '/custom/path/to/.env' })
By default, config will look for a file called .env in the current working directory.
Pass in multiple files as an array, and they will be parsed in order and combined with process.env (or option.processEnv, if set). The first value set for a variable will win, unless the options.override flag is set, in which case the last value set will win.  If a value already exists in process.env and the options.override flag is NOT set, no changes will be made to that value.
require('dotenv').config({ path: ['.env.local', '.env'] })
encoding
Default: utf8
Specify the encoding of your file containing environment variables.
require('dotenv').config({ encoding: 'latin1' })
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
require('dotenv').config({ debug: process.env.DEBUG })
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set on your machine with values from your .env file(s). If multiple files have been provided in option.path the override will also be used as each file is combined with the next. Without override being set, the first value wins. With override set the last value wins.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
processEnv
Default: process.env
Specify an object to write your environment variables to. Defaults to process.env environment variables.
const myObject = {}
require('dotenv').config({ processEnv: myObject })

console.log(myObject) // values from .env
console.log(process.env) // this was not changed or written to
Parse
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment
variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return
an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Options
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('hello world')
const opt = { debug: true }
const config = dotenv.parse(buf, opt)
// expect a debug message because the buffer is not in KEY=VAL form
Populate
The engine which populates the contents of your .env file to process.env is available for use. It accepts a target, a source, and options. This is useful for power users who want to supply their own objects.
For example, customizing the source:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'world' }

dotenv.populate(process.env, parsed)

console.log(process.env.HELLO) // world
For example, customizing the source AND target:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'universe' }
const target = { HELLO: 'world' } // empty object

dotenv.populate(target, parsed, { override: true, debug: true })

console.log(target) // { HELLO: 'universe' }
options
Debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being populated as you expect.
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set.
‚ùì FAQ
Why is the .env file not loading my environment variables successfully?
Most likely your .env file is not in the correct place. See this stack overflow.
Turn on debug mode and try again..
require('dotenv').config({ debug: true })
You will receive a helpful error outputted to your console.
Should I commit my .env file?
No. We strongly recommend against committing your .env file to version
control. It should only include environment-specific values such as database
passwords or API keys. Your production database should have a different
password than your development database.
Should I have multiple .env files?
We recommend creating one .env file per environment. Use .env for local/development, .env.production for production and so on. This still follows the twelve factor principles as each is attributed individually to its own environment. Avoid custom set ups that work in inheritance somehow (.env.production inherits values form .env for example). It is better to duplicate values if necessary across each .env.environment file.

In a twelve-factor app, env vars are granular controls, each fully orthogonal to other env vars. They are never grouped together as ‚Äúenvironments‚Äù, but instead are independently managed for each deploy. This is a model that scales up smoothly as the app naturally expands into more deploys over its lifetime.
‚Äì The Twelve-Factor App

What rules does the parsing engine follow?
The parsing engine currently supports the following rules:

BASIC=basic becomes {BASIC: 'basic'}
empty lines are skipped
lines beginning with # are treated as comments
# marks the beginning of a comment (unless when the value is wrapped in quotes)
empty values become empty strings (EMPTY= becomes {EMPTY: ''})
inner quotes are maintained (think JSON) (JSON={"foo": "bar"} becomes {JSON:"{\"foo\": \"bar\"}")
whitespace is removed from both ends of unquoted values (see more on trim) (FOO=  some value   becomes {FOO: 'some value'})
single and double quoted values are escaped (SINGLE_QUOTE='quoted' becomes {SINGLE_QUOTE: "quoted"})
single and double quoted values maintain whitespace from both ends (FOO="  some value  " becomes {FOO: '  some value  '})
double quoted values expand new lines (MULTILINE="new\nline" becomes

{MULTILINE: 'new
line'}


backticks are supported (BACKTICK_KEY=`This has 'single' and "double" quotes inside of it.`)

What happens to environment variables that were already set?
By default, we will never modify any environment variables that have already been set. In particular, if there is a variable in your .env file which collides with one that already exists in your environment, then that variable will be skipped.
If instead, you want to override process.env use the override option.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
How come my environment variables are not showing up for React?
Your React code is run in Webpack, where the fs module or even the process global itself are not accessible out-of-the-box. process.env can only be injected through Webpack configuration.
If you are using react-scripts, which is distributed through create-react-app, it has dotenv built in but with a quirk. Preface your environment variables with REACT_APP_. See this stack overflow for more details.
If you are using other frameworks (e.g. Next.js, Gatsby...), you need to consult their documentation for how to inject environment variables into the client.
Can I customize/write plugins for dotenv?
Yes! dotenv.config() returns an object representing the parsed .env file. This gives you everything you need to continue setting values on process.env. For example:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const variableExpansion = require('dotenv-expand')
const myEnv = dotenv.config()
variableExpansion(myEnv)
How do I use dotenv with import?
Simply..
// index.mjs (ESM)
import 'dotenv/config' // see https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#how-do-i-use-dotenv-with-import
import express from 'express'
A little background..

When you run a module containing an import declaration, the modules it imports are loaded first, then each module body is executed in a depth-first traversal of the dependency graph, avoiding cycles by skipping anything already executed.
‚Äì ES6 In Depth: Modules

What does this mean in plain language? It means you would think the following would work but it won't.
errorReporter.mjs:
class Client {
  constructor (apiKey) {
    console.log('apiKey', apiKey)

    this.apiKey = apiKey
  }
}

export default new Client(process.env.API_KEY)
index.mjs:
// Note: this is INCORRECT and will not work
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv'
dotenv.config()

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs' // process.env.API_KEY will be blank!
process.env.API_KEY will be blank.
Instead, index.mjs should be written as..
import 'dotenv/config'

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs'
Does that make sense? It's a bit unintuitive, but it is how importing of ES6 modules work. Here is a working example of this pitfall.
There are two alternatives to this approach:

Preload dotenv: node --require dotenv/config index.js (Note: you do not need to import dotenv with this approach)
Create a separate file that will execute config first as outlined in this comment on #133

Why am I getting the error Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'crypto|os|path'?
You are using dotenv on the front-end and have not included a polyfill. Webpack < 5 used to include these for you. Do the following:
npm install node-polyfill-webpack-plugin
Configure your webpack.config.js to something like the following.
require('dotenv').config()

const path = require('path');
const webpack = require('webpack')

const NodePolyfillPlugin = require('node-polyfill-webpack-plugin')

module.exports = {
  mode: 'development',
  entry: './src/index.ts',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  plugins: [
    new NodePolyfillPlugin(),
    new webpack.DefinePlugin({
      'process.env': {
        HELLO: JSON.stringify(process.env.HELLO)
      }
    }),
  ]
};
Alternatively, just use dotenv-webpack which does this and more behind the scenes for you.
What about variable expansion?
Try dotenv-expand
What about syncing and securing .env files?
Use dotenvx
What if I accidentally commit my .env file to code?
Remove it, remove git history and then install the git pre-commit hook to prevent this from ever happening again.
brew install dotenvx/brew/dotenvx
dotenvx precommit --install

How can I prevent committing my .env file to a Docker build?
Use the docker prebuild hook.
# Dockerfile
...
RUN curl -fsS https://dotenvx.sh/ | sh
...
RUN dotenvx prebuild
CMD ["dotenvx", "run", "--", "node", "index.js"]

dotenv 

Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology.

üå± Install
npm install dotenv --save
You can also use an npm-compatible package manager like yarn or bun:
yarn add dotenv
# or
bun add dotenv
üèóÔ∏è Usage






Create a .env file in the root of your project (if using a monorepo structure like apps/backend/app.js, put it in the root of the folder where your app.js process runs):
S3_BUCKET="YOURS3BUCKET"
SECRET_KEY="YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE"
As early as possible in your application, import and configure dotenv:
require('dotenv').config()
console.log(process.env) // remove this after you've confirmed it is working
.. or using ES6?
import 'dotenv/config'
That's it. process.env now has the keys and values you defined in your .env file:
require('dotenv').config()
// or import 'dotenv/config' if you're using ES6

...

s3.getBucketCors({Bucket: process.env.S3_BUCKET}, function(err, data) {})
Multiline values
If you need multiline variables, for example private keys, those are now supported (>= v15.0.0) with line breaks:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
...
Kh9NV...
...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
Alternatively, you can double quote strings and use the \n character:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nKh9NV...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
Comments
Comments may be added to your file on their own line or inline:
# This is a comment
SECRET_KEY=YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE # comment
SECRET_HASH="something-with-a-#-hash"
Comments begin where a # exists, so if your value contains a # please wrap it in quotes. This is a breaking change from >= v15.0.0 and on.
Parsing
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Preload

Note: Consider using dotenvx instead of preloading. I am now doing (and recommending) so.
It serves the same purpose (you do not need to require and load dotenv), adds better debugging, and works with ANY language, framework, or platform. ‚Äì motdotla

You can use the --require (-r) command line option to preload dotenv. By doing this, you do not need to require and load dotenv in your application code.
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
The configuration options below are supported as command line arguments in the format dotenv_config_<option>=value
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env dotenv_config_debug=true
Additionally, you can use environment variables to set configuration options. Command line arguments will precede these.
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_<OPTION>=value node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_ENCODING=latin1 DOTENV_CONFIG_DEBUG=true node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env
Variable Expansion
You need to add the value of another variable in one of your variables? Use dotenv-expand.
Command Substitution
Use dotenvx to use command substitution.
Add the output of a command to one of your variables in your .env file.
# .env
DATABASE_URL="postgres://$(whoami)@localhost/my_database"
// index.js
console.log('DATABASE_URL', process.env.DATABASE_URL)
$ dotenvx run --debug -- node index.js
[dotenvx@0.14.1] injecting env (1) from .env
DATABASE_URL postgres://yourusername@localhost/my_database
Syncing
You need to keep .env files in sync between machines, environments, or team members? Use dotenvx to encrypt your .env files and safely include them in source control. This still subscribes to the twelve-factor app rules by generating a decryption key separate from code.
Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx to generate .env.ci, .env.production files, and more.
Deploying
You need to deploy your secrets in a cloud-agnostic manner? Use dotenvx to generate a private decryption key that is set on your production server.
üå¥ Manage Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx
Run any environment locally. Create a .env.ENVIRONMENT file and use --env-file to load it. It's straightforward, yet flexible.
$ echo "HELLO=production" > .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.production -- node index.js
Hello production
> ^^
or with multiple .env files
$ echo "HELLO=local" > .env.local
$ echo "HELLO=World" > .env
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.local --env-file=.env -- node index.js
Hello local
more environment examples
üöÄ Deploying
Use dotenvx.
Add encryption to your .env files with a single command. Pass the --encrypt flag.
$ dotenvx set HELLO Production --encrypt -f .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION="<.env.production private key>" dotenvx run -- node index.js
[dotenvx] injecting env (2) from .env.production
Hello Production

üìñ Documentation
Dotenv exposes four functions:

config
parse
populate
decrypt

Config
config will read your .env file, parse the contents, assign it to
process.env,
and return an Object with a parsed key containing the loaded content or an error key if it failed.
const result = dotenv.config()

if (result.error) {
  throw result.error
}

console.log(result.parsed)
You can additionally, pass options to config.
Options
path
Default: path.resolve(process.cwd(), '.env')
Specify a custom path if your file containing environment variables is located elsewhere.
require('dotenv').config({ path: '/custom/path/to/.env' })
By default, config will look for a file called .env in the current working directory.
Pass in multiple files as an array, and they will be parsed in order and combined with process.env (or option.processEnv, if set). The first value set for a variable will win, unless the options.override flag is set, in which case the last value set will win.  If a value already exists in process.env and the options.override flag is NOT set, no changes will be made to that value.
require('dotenv').config({ path: ['.env.local', '.env'] })
encoding
Default: utf8
Specify the encoding of your file containing environment variables.
require('dotenv').config({ encoding: 'latin1' })
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
require('dotenv').config({ debug: process.env.DEBUG })
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set on your machine with values from your .env file(s). If multiple files have been provided in option.path the override will also be used as each file is combined with the next. Without override being set, the first value wins. With override set the last value wins.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
processEnv
Default: process.env
Specify an object to write your environment variables to. Defaults to process.env environment variables.
const myObject = {}
require('dotenv').config({ processEnv: myObject })

console.log(myObject) // values from .env
console.log(process.env) // this was not changed or written to
Parse
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment
variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return
an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Options
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('hello world')
const opt = { debug: true }
const config = dotenv.parse(buf, opt)
// expect a debug message because the buffer is not in KEY=VAL form
Populate
The engine which populates the contents of your .env file to process.env is available for use. It accepts a target, a source, and options. This is useful for power users who want to supply their own objects.
For example, customizing the source:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'world' }

dotenv.populate(process.env, parsed)

console.log(process.env.HELLO) // world
For example, customizing the source AND target:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'universe' }
const target = { HELLO: 'world' } // empty object

dotenv.populate(target, parsed, { override: true, debug: true })

console.log(target) // { HELLO: 'universe' }
options
Debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being populated as you expect.
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set.
‚ùì FAQ
Why is the .env file not loading my environment variables successfully?
Most likely your .env file is not in the correct place. See this stack overflow.
Turn on debug mode and try again..
require('dotenv').config({ debug: true })
You will receive a helpful error outputted to your console.
Should I commit my .env file?
No. We strongly recommend against committing your .env file to version
control. It should only include environment-specific values such as database
passwords or API keys. Your production database should have a different
password than your development database.
Should I have multiple .env files?
We recommend creating one .env file per environment. Use .env for local/development, .env.production for production and so on. This still follows the twelve factor principles as each is attributed individually to its own environment. Avoid custom set ups that work in inheritance somehow (.env.production inherits values form .env for example). It is better to duplicate values if necessary across each .env.environment file.

In a twelve-factor app, env vars are granular controls, each fully orthogonal to other env vars. They are never grouped together as ‚Äúenvironments‚Äù, but instead are independently managed for each deploy. This is a model that scales up smoothly as the app naturally expands into more deploys over its lifetime.
‚Äì The Twelve-Factor App

What rules does the parsing engine follow?
The parsing engine currently supports the following rules:

BASIC=basic becomes {BASIC: 'basic'}
empty lines are skipped
lines beginning with # are treated as comments
# marks the beginning of a comment (unless when the value is wrapped in quotes)
empty values become empty strings (EMPTY= becomes {EMPTY: ''})
inner quotes are maintained (think JSON) (JSON={"foo": "bar"} becomes {JSON:"{\"foo\": \"bar\"}")
whitespace is removed from both ends of unquoted values (see more on trim) (FOO=  some value   becomes {FOO: 'some value'})
single and double quoted values are escaped (SINGLE_QUOTE='quoted' becomes {SINGLE_QUOTE: "quoted"})
single and double quoted values maintain whitespace from both ends (FOO="  some value  " becomes {FOO: '  some value  '})
double quoted values expand new lines (MULTILINE="new\nline" becomes

{MULTILINE: 'new
line'}


backticks are supported (BACKTICK_KEY=`This has 'single' and "double" quotes inside of it.`)

What happens to environment variables that were already set?
By default, we will never modify any environment variables that have already been set. In particular, if there is a variable in your .env file which collides with one that already exists in your environment, then that variable will be skipped.
If instead, you want to override process.env use the override option.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
How come my environment variables are not showing up for React?
Your React code is run in Webpack, where the fs module or even the process global itself are not accessible out-of-the-box. process.env can only be injected through Webpack configuration.
If you are using react-scripts, which is distributed through create-react-app, it has dotenv built in but with a quirk. Preface your environment variables with REACT_APP_. See this stack overflow for more details.
If you are using other frameworks (e.g. Next.js, Gatsby...), you need to consult their documentation for how to inject environment variables into the client.
Can I customize/write plugins for dotenv?
Yes! dotenv.config() returns an object representing the parsed .env file. This gives you everything you need to continue setting values on process.env. For example:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const variableExpansion = require('dotenv-expand')
const myEnv = dotenv.config()
variableExpansion(myEnv)
How do I use dotenv with import?
Simply..
// index.mjs (ESM)
import 'dotenv/config' // see https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#how-do-i-use-dotenv-with-import
import express from 'express'
A little background..

When you run a module containing an import declaration, the modules it imports are loaded first, then each module body is executed in a depth-first traversal of the dependency graph, avoiding cycles by skipping anything already executed.
‚Äì ES6 In Depth: Modules

What does this mean in plain language? It means you would think the following would work but it won't.
errorReporter.mjs:
class Client {
  constructor (apiKey) {
    console.log('apiKey', apiKey)

    this.apiKey = apiKey
  }
}

export default new Client(process.env.API_KEY)
index.mjs:
// Note: this is INCORRECT and will not work
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv'
dotenv.config()

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs' // process.env.API_KEY will be blank!
process.env.API_KEY will be blank.
Instead, index.mjs should be written as..
import 'dotenv/config'

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs'
Does that make sense? It's a bit unintuitive, but it is how importing of ES6 modules work. Here is a working example of this pitfall.
There are two alternatives to this approach:

Preload dotenv: node --require dotenv/config index.js (Note: you do not need to import dotenv with this approach)
Create a separate file that will execute config first as outlined in this comment on #133

Why am I getting the error Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'crypto|os|path'?
You are using dotenv on the front-end and have not included a polyfill. Webpack < 5 used to include these for you. Do the following:
npm install node-polyfill-webpack-plugin
Configure your webpack.config.js to something like the following.
require('dotenv').config()

const path = require('path');
const webpack = require('webpack')

const NodePolyfillPlugin = require('node-polyfill-webpack-plugin')

module.exports = {
  mode: 'development',
  entry: './src/index.ts',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  plugins: [
    new NodePolyfillPlugin(),
    new webpack.DefinePlugin({
      'process.env': {
        HELLO: JSON.stringify(process.env.HELLO)
      }
    }),
  ]
};
Alternatively, just use dotenv-webpack which does this and more behind the scenes for you.
What about variable expansion?
Try dotenv-expand
What about syncing and securing .env files?
Use dotenvx
What if I accidentally commit my .env file to code?
Remove it, remove git history and then install the git pre-commit hook to prevent this from ever happening again.
brew install dotenvx/brew/dotenvx
dotenvx precommit --install

How can I prevent committing my .env file to a Docker build?
Use the docker prebuild hook.
# Dockerfile
...
RUN curl -fsS https://dotenvx.sh/ | sh
...
RUN dotenvx prebuild
CMD ["dotenvx", "run", "--", "node", "index.js"]

Who's using dotenv?
These npm modules depend on it.
Projects that expand it often use the keyword "dotenv" on npm.

JavaScript style guide, linter, and formatter
This module saves you (and others!) time in three ways:

No configuration. The easiest way to enforce code quality in your
project. No decisions to make. No .eslintrc files to manage. It just works.
Automatically format code. Just run standard --fix and say goodbye to
messy or inconsistent code.
Catch style issues & programmer errors early. Save precious code review
time by eliminating back-and-forth between reviewer & contributor.

Give it a try by running npx standard --fix right now!

Install
The easiest way to use JavaScript Standard Style is to install it globally as a
Node command line program. Run the following command in Terminal:
$ npm install standard --global
Or, you can install standard locally, for use in a single project:
$ npm install standard --save-dev
Note: To run the preceding commands, Node.js and npm must be installed.
Usage
After you've installed standard, you should be able to use the standard program. The
simplest use case would be checking the style of all JavaScript files in the
current working directory:
$ standard
Error: Use JavaScript Standard Style
  lib/torrent.js:950:11: Expected '===' and instead saw '=='.
If you've installed standard locally, run with npx instead:
$ npx standard
You can optionally pass in a directory (or directories) using the glob pattern. Be
sure to quote paths containing glob patterns so that they are expanded by
standard instead of your shell:
$ standard "src/util/**/*.js" "test/**/*.js"
Note: by default standard will look for all files matching the patterns:
**/*.js, **/*.jsx.
What you might do if you're clever


Add it to package.json
{
  "name": "my-cool-package",
  "devDependencies": {
    "standard": "*"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "test": "standard && node my-tests.js"
  }
}


Style is checked automatically when you run npm test
$ npm test
Error: Use JavaScript Standard Style
  lib/torrent.js:950:11: Expected '===' and instead saw '=='.


Never give style feedback on a pull request again!


Why should I use JavaScript Standard Style?
The beauty of JavaScript Standard Style is that it's simple. No one wants to
maintain multiple hundred-line style configuration files for every module/project
they work on. Enough of this madness!
This module saves you (and others!) time in three ways:

No configuration. The easiest way to enforce consistent style in your
project. Just drop it in.
Automatically format code. Just run standard --fix and say goodbye to
messy or inconsistent code.
Catch style issues & programmer errors early. Save precious code review
time by eliminating back-and-forth between reviewer & contributor.

Adopting standard style means ranking the importance of code clarity and
community conventions higher than personal style. This might not make sense for
100% of projects and development cultures, however open source can be a hostile
place for newbies. Setting up clear, automated contributor expectations makes a
project healthier.
For more info, see the conference talk "Write Perfect Code with Standard and
ESLint". In this talk, you'll learn
about linting, when to use standard versus eslint, and how prettier compares
to standard.

Your Logo Here




In addition to companies, many community members use standard on packages that
are too numerous
to list here.
standard is also the top-starred linter in GitHub's
Clean Code Linter showcase.
Are there text editor plugins?
First, install standard. Then, install the appropriate plugin for your editor:
Sublime Text
Using Package Control, install SublimeLinter and
SublimeLinter-contrib-standard.
For automatic formatting on save, install StandardFormat.
Atom
Install linter-js-standard.
Alternatively, you can install linter-js-standard-engine. Instead of
bundling a version of standard it will automatically use the version installed
in your current project. It will also work out of the box with other linters based
on standard-engine.
For automatic formatting, install standard-formatter. For snippets,
install standardjs-snippets.
Visual Studio Code
Install vscode-standard. (Includes support for automatic formatting.)
For JS snippets, install: vscode-standardjs-snippets. For React snippets, install vscode-react-standard.
Vim
Install ale. And add these lines to your .vimrc file.
let g:ale_linters = {
\   'javascript': ['standard'],
\}
let g:ale_fixers = {'javascript': ['standard']}
This sets standard as your only linter and fixer for javascript files and so prevents conflicts with eslint. For linting and automatic fixing on save, add these lines to .vimrc:
let g:ale_lint_on_save = 1
let g:ale_fix_on_save = 1
Alternative plugins to consider include neomake and syntastic, both of which have built-in support for standard (though configuration may be necessary).
Emacs
Install Flycheck and check out the manual to learn
how to enable it in your projects.
Brackets
Search the extension registry for "Standard Code Style" and click "Install".
WebStorm (PhpStorm, IntelliJ, RubyMine, JetBrains, etc.)
WebStorm recently announced native support
for standard directly in the IDE.
If you still prefer to configure standard manually, follow this guide. This applies to all JetBrains products, including PhpStorm, IntelliJ, RubyMine, etc.
Is there a readme badge?
Yes! If you use standard in your project, you can include one of these badges in
your readme to let people know that your code is using the standard style.

[![JavaScript Style Guide](https://cdn.rawgit.com/standard/standard/master/badge.svg)](https://github.com/standard/standard)

[![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com)
I disagree with rule X, can you change it?
No. The whole point of standard is to save you time by avoiding
bikeshedding about code style. There are lots of debates online about
tabs vs. spaces, etc. that will never be resolved. These debates just distract from
getting stuff done. At the end of the day you have to 'just pick something', and
that's the whole philosophy of standard -- its a bunch of sensible 'just pick
something' opinions. Hopefully, users see the value in that over defending their
own opinions.
There are a couple of similar packages for anyone who does not want to completely accept standard:

semistandard - standard, with semicolons
standardx - standard, with custom tweaks

If you really want to configure hundreds of ESLint rules individually, you can
always use eslint directly with
eslint-config-standard to
layer your changes on top.
standard-eject can help
you migrate from standard to eslint and eslint-config-standard.
Pro tip: Just use standard and move on. There are actual real problems that you
could spend your time solving! :P
But this isn't a real web standard!
Of course it's not! The style laid out here is not affiliated with any official web
standards groups, which is why this repo is called standard/standard and not
ECMA/standard.
The word "standard" has more meanings than just "web standard" :-) For example:

This module helps hold our code to a high standard of quality.
This module ensures that new contributors follow some basic style standards.

Is there an automatic formatter?
Yes! You can use standard --fix to fix most issues automatically.
standard --fix is built into standard for maximum convenience. Most problems
are fixable, but some errors (like forgetting to handle errors) must be fixed
manually.
To save you time, standard outputs the message "Run standard --fix to automatically fix some problems" when it detects problems that can be fixed
automatically.
How do I ignore files?
Certain paths (node_modules/, coverage/, vendor/, *.min.js,
and files/folders that begin with . like .git/) are automatically ignored.
Paths in a project's root .gitignore file are also automatically ignored.
Sometimes you need to ignore additional folders or specific minified files. To do
that, add a standard.ignore property to package.json:
"standard": {
  "ignore": [
    "**/out/",
    "/lib/select2/",
    "/lib/ckeditor/",
    "tmp.js"
  ]
}
How do I disable a rule?
In rare cases, you'll need to break a rule and hide the error generated by
standard.
JavaScript Standard Style uses ESLint under-the-hood and
you can hide errors as you normally would if you used ESLint directly.
Disable all rules on a specific line:
file = 'I know what I am doing' // eslint-disable-line
Or, disable only the "no-use-before-define" rule:
file = 'I know what I am doing' // eslint-disable-line no-use-before-define
Or, disable the "no-use-before-define" rule for multiple lines:
/* eslint-disable no-use-before-define */
console.log('offending code goes here...')
console.log('offending code goes here...')
console.log('offending code goes here...')
/* eslint-enable no-use-before-define */
I use a library that pollutes the global namespace. How do I prevent "variable is not defined" errors?
Some packages (e.g. mocha) put their functions (e.g. describe, it) on the
global object (poor form!). Since these functions are not defined or require'd
anywhere in your code, standard will warn that you're using a variable that is
not defined (usually, this rule is really useful for catching typos!). But we want
to disable it for these global variables.
To let standard (as well as humans reading your code) know that certain variables
are global in your code, add this to the top of your file:
/* global myVar1, myVar2 */
If you have hundreds of files, it may be desirable to avoid adding comments to
every file. In this case, run:
$ standard --global myVar1 --global myVar2
Or, add this to package.json:
{
  "standard": {
    "globals": [ "myVar1", "myVar2" ]
  }
}
Note: global and globals are equivalent.
How do I use experimental JavaScript (ES Next) features?
standard supports the latest ECMAScript features, ES8 (ES2017), including
language feature proposals that are in "Stage 4" of the proposal process.
To support experimental language features, standard supports specifying a
custom JavaScript parser. Before using a custom parser, consider whether the added
complexity is worth it.
To use a custom parser, first install it from npm:
npm install @babel/eslint-parser --save-dev
Then run:
$ standard --parser @babel/eslint-parser
Or, add this to package.json:
{
  "standard": {
    "parser": "@babel/eslint-parser"
  }
}
Can I use a JavaScript language variant, like Flow or TypeScript?
standard supports the latest ECMAScript features. However, Flow and TypeScript add new
syntax to the language, so they are not supported out-of-the-box.
For TypeScript, an official variant ts-standard is supported and maintained that provides a very
similar experience to standard.
For other JavaScript language variants, standard supports specifying a custom JavaScript
parser as well as an ESLint plugin to handle the changed syntax. Before using a JavaScript
language variant, consider whether the added complexity is worth it.
TypeScript
ts-standard is the officially supported variant for
TypeScript. ts-standard supports all the same rules and options as standard and includes
additional TypeScript specific rules. ts-standard will even lint regular javascript files
by setting the configuration in tsconfig.json.
npm install ts-standard --save-dev
Then run (where tsconfig.json is located in the working directory):
$ ts-standard
Or, add this to package.json:
{
  "ts-standard": {
    "project": "./tsconfig.json"
  }
}
Note: To include additional files in linting such as test files, create a tsconfig.eslint.json file to use instead.
If you really want to configure hundreds of ESLint rules individually, you can always use eslint
directly with eslint-config-standard-with-typescript
to layer your changes on top.
Flow
To use Flow, you need to run standard with @babel/eslint-parser as the parser and
eslint-plugin-flowtype as a plugin.
npm install @babel/eslint-parser eslint-plugin-flowtype --save-dev
Then run:
$ standard --parser @babel/eslint-parser --plugin flowtype
Or, add this to package.json:
{
  "standard": {
    "parser": "@babel/eslint-parser",
    "plugins": [ "flowtype" ]
  }
}
Note: plugin and plugins are equivalent.
What about Mocha, Jest, Jasmine, QUnit, etc?
To support mocha in test files, add this to the top of the test files:
/* eslint-env mocha */
Or, run:
$ standard --env mocha
Where mocha can be one of jest, jasmine, qunit, phantomjs, and so on. To see a
full list, check ESLint's
specifying environments
documentation. For a list of what globals are available for these environments,
check the
globals npm
module.
Note: env and envs are equivalent.
What about Web Workers and Service Workers?
Add this to the top of web worker files:
/* eslint-env worker */
This lets standard (as well as humans reading the code) know that self is a
global in web worker code.
For Service workers, add this instead:
/* eslint-env serviceworker */
What is the difference between warnings and errors?
standard treats all rule violations as errors, which means that standard
will exit with a non-zero (error) exit code.
However, we may occasionally release a new major version of standard
which changes a rule that affects the majority of standard users (for example,
transitioning from var to let/const). We do this only when we think the
advantage is worth the cost and only when the rule is
auto-fixable.
In these situations, we have a "transition period" where the rule change is only
a "warning". Warnings don't cause standard to return a non-zero (error)
exit code. However, a warning message will still print to the console. During
the transition period, using standard --fix will update your code so that it's
ready for the next major version.
The slow and careful approach is what we strive for with standard. We're
generally extremely conservative in enforcing the usage of new language
features. We want using standard to be light and fun and so we're careful
about making changes that may get in your way. As always, you can
disable a rule at any time, if necessary.
Can I check code inside of Markdown or HTML files?
To check code inside Markdown files, use standard-markdown.
Alternatively, there are ESLint plugins that can check code inside Markdown, HTML,
and many other types of language files:
To check code inside Markdown files, use an ESLint plugin:
$ npm install eslint-plugin-markdown
Then, to check JS that appears inside code blocks, run:
$ standard --plugin markdown '**/*.md'
To check code inside HTML files, use an ESLint plugin:
$ npm install eslint-plugin-html
Then, to check JS that appears inside <script> tags, run:
$ standard --plugin html '**/*.html'
Is there a Git pre-commit hook?
Yes! Hooks are great for ensuring that unstyled code never even makes it into your repo.
Never give style feedback on a pull request again!
You even have a choice...
Install your own hook
#!/bin/bash

# Ensure all JavaScript files staged for commit pass standard code style
function xargs-r() {
  # Portable version of "xargs -r". The -r flag is a GNU extension that
  # prevents xargs from running if there are no input files.
  if IFS= read -r -d $'\n' path; then
    echo "$path" | cat - | xargs "$@"
  fi
}
git diff --name-only --cached --relative | grep '\.jsx\?$' | sed 's/[^[:alnum:]]/\\&/g' | xargs-r -E '' -t standard
if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then
  echo 'JavaScript Standard Style errors were detected. Aborting commit.'
  exit 1
fi
Use a pre-commit hook
The pre-commit library allows hooks to be declared within a .pre-commit-config.yaml configuration file in the repo, and therefore more easily maintained across a team.
Users of pre-commit can simply add standard to their .pre-commit-config.yaml file, which will automatically fix .js, .jsx, .mjs and .cjs files:
  - repo: https://github.com/standard/standard
    rev: master
    hooks:
      - id: standard
Alternatively, for more advanced styling configurations, use standard within the eslint hook:
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-eslint
    rev: master
    hooks:
      - id: eslint
        files: \.[jt]sx?$  # *.js, *.jsx, *.ts and *.tsx
        types: [file]
        additional_dependencies:
          - eslint@latest
          - eslint-config-standard@latest
          # and whatever other plugins...
How do I make the output all colorful and pretty?
The built-in output is simple and straightforward, but if you like shiny things,
install snazzy:
$ npm install snazzy
And run:
$ standard | snazzy
There's also standard-tap,
standard-json,
standard-reporter, and
standard-summary.
Is there a Node.js API?
Yes!
async standard.lintText(text, [opts])
Lint the provided source text. An opts object may be provided:
{
  // unique to lintText
  filename: '',         // path of file containing the text being linted

  // common to lintText and lintFiles
  cwd: '',              // current working directory (default: process.cwd())
  fix: false,           // automatically fix problems
  extensions: [],       // file extensions to lint (has sane defaults)
  globals: [],          // custom global variables to declare
  plugins: [],          // custom eslint plugins
  envs: [],             // custom eslint environment
  parser: '',           // custom js parser (e.g. babel-eslint)
  usePackageJson: true, // use options from nearest package.json?
  useGitIgnore: true    // use file ignore patterns from .gitignore?
}
All options are optional, though some ESLint plugins require the filename option.
Additional options may be loaded from a package.json if it's found for the current working directory. See below for further details.
Returns a Promise resolving to the results or rejected with an Error.
The results object will contain the following properties:
const results = {
  results: [
    {
      filePath: '',
      messages: [
        { ruleId: '', message: '', line: 0, column: 0 }
      ],
      errorCount: 0,
      warningCount: 0,
      output: '' // fixed source code (only present with {fix: true} option)
    }
  ],
  errorCount: 0,
  warningCount: 0
}
async standard.lintFiles(files, [opts])
Lint the provided files globs. An opts object may be provided:
{
  // unique to lintFiles
  ignore: [],           // file globs to ignore (has sane defaults)

  // common to lintText and lintFiles
  cwd: '',              // current working directory (default: process.cwd())
  fix: false,           // automatically fix problems
  extensions: [],       // file extensions to lint (has sane defaults)
  globals: [],          // custom global variables to declare
  plugins: [],          // custom eslint plugins
  envs: [],             // custom eslint environment
  parser: '',           // custom js parser (e.g. babel-eslint)
  usePackageJson: true, // use options from nearest package.json?
  useGitIgnore: true    // use file ignore patterns from .gitignore?
}
Additional options may be loaded from a package.json if it's found for the current working directory. See below for further details.
Both ignore and files patterns are resolved relative to the current working directory.
Returns a Promise resolving to the results or rejected with an Error (same as above).

JavaScript style guide, linter, and formatter
This module saves you (and others!) time in three ways:

No configuration. The easiest way to enforce code quality in your
project. No decisions to make. No .eslintrc files to manage. It just works.
Automatically format code. Just run standard --fix and say goodbye to
messy or inconsistent code.
Catch style issues & programmer errors early. Save precious code review
time by eliminating back-and-forth between reviewer & contributor.

Give it a try by running npx standard --fix right now!

Install
The easiest way to use JavaScript Standard Style is to install it globally as a
Node command line program. Run the following command in Terminal:
$ npm install standard --global
Or, you can install standard locally, for use in a single project:
$ npm install standard --save-dev
Note: To run the preceding commands, Node.js and npm must be installed.
Usage
After you've installed standard, you should be able to use the standard program. The
simplest use case would be checking the style of all JavaScript files in the
current working directory:
$ standard
Error: Use JavaScript Standard Style
  lib/torrent.js:950:11: Expected '===' and instead saw '=='.
If you've installed standard locally, run with npx instead:
$ npx standard
You can optionally pass in a directory (or directories) using the glob pattern. Be
sure to quote paths containing glob patterns so that they are expanded by
standard instead of your shell:
$ standard "src/util/**/*.js" "test/**/*.js"
Note: by default standard will look for all files matching the patterns:
**/*.js, **/*.jsx.
What you might do if you're clever


Add it to package.json
{
  "name": "my-cool-package",
  "devDependencies": {
    "standard": "*"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "test": "standard && node my-tests.js"
  }
}


Style is checked automatically when you run npm test
$ npm test
Error: Use JavaScript Standard Style
  lib/torrent.js:950:11: Expected '===' and instead saw '=='.


Never give style feedback on a pull request again!


Why should I use JavaScript Standard Style?
The beauty of JavaScript Standard Style is that it's simple. No one wants to
maintain multiple hundred-line style configuration files for every module/project
they work on. Enough of this madness!
This module saves you (and others!) time in three ways:

No configuration. The easiest way to enforce consistent style in your
project. Just drop it in.
Automatically format code. Just run standard --fix and say goodbye to
messy or inconsistent code.
Catch style issues & programmer errors early. Save precious code review
time by eliminating back-and-forth between reviewer & contributor.

Adopting standard style means ranking the importance of code clarity and
community conventions higher than personal style. This might not make sense for
100% of projects and development cultures, however open source can be a hostile
place for newbies. Setting up clear, automated contributor expectations makes a
project healthier.
For more info, see the conference talk "Write Perfect Code with Standard and
ESLint". In this talk, you'll learn
about linting, when to use standard versus eslint, and how prettier compares
to standard.

Your Logo Here




In addition to companies, many community members use standard on packages that
are too numerous
to list here.
standard is also the top-starred linter in GitHub's
Clean Code Linter showcase.
Are there text editor plugins?
First, install standard. Then, install the appropriate plugin for your editor:
Sublime Text
Using Package Control, install SublimeLinter and
SublimeLinter-contrib-standard.
For automatic formatting on save, install StandardFormat.
Atom
Install linter-js-standard.
Alternatively, you can install linter-js-standard-engine. Instead of
bundling a version of standard it will automatically use the version installed
in your current project. It will also work out of the box with other linters based
on standard-engine.
For automatic formatting, install standard-formatter. For snippets,
install standardjs-snippets.
Visual Studio Code
Install vscode-standard. (Includes support for automatic formatting.)
For JS snippets, install: vscode-standardjs-snippets. For React snippets, install vscode-react-standard.
Vim
Install ale. And add these lines to your .vimrc file.
let g:ale_linters = {
\   'javascript': ['standard'],
\}
let g:ale_fixers = {'javascript': ['standard']}
This sets standard as your only linter and fixer for javascript files and so prevents conflicts with eslint. For linting and automatic fixing on save, add these lines to .vimrc:
let g:ale_lint_on_save = 1
let g:ale_fix_on_save = 1
Alternative plugins to consider include neomake and syntastic, both of which have built-in support for standard (though configuration may be necessary).
Emacs
Install Flycheck and check out the manual to learn
how to enable it in your projects.
Brackets
Search the extension registry for "Standard Code Style" and click "Install".
WebStorm (PhpStorm, IntelliJ, RubyMine, JetBrains, etc.)
WebStorm recently announced native support
for standard directly in the IDE.
If you still prefer to configure standard manually, follow this guide. This applies to all JetBrains products, including PhpStorm, IntelliJ, RubyMine, etc.
Is there a readme badge?
Yes! If you use standard in your project, you can include one of these badges in
your readme to let people know that your code is using the standard style.

[![JavaScript Style Guide](https://cdn.rawgit.com/standard/standard/master/badge.svg)](https://github.com/standard/standard)

[![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com)
I disagree with rule X, can you change it?
No. The whole point of standard is to save you time by avoiding
bikeshedding about code style. There are lots of debates online about
tabs vs. spaces, etc. that will never be resolved. These debates just distract from
getting stuff done. At the end of the day you have to 'just pick something', and
that's the whole philosophy of standard -- its a bunch of sensible 'just pick
something' opinions. Hopefully, users see the value in that over defending their
own opinions.
There are a couple of similar packages for anyone who does not want to completely accept standard:

semistandard - standard, with semicolons
standardx - standard, with custom tweaks

If you really want to configure hundreds of ESLint rules individually, you can
always use eslint directly with
eslint-config-standard to
layer your changes on top.
standard-eject can help
you migrate from standard to eslint and eslint-config-standard.
Pro tip: Just use standard and move on. There are actual real problems that you
could spend your time solving! :P
But this isn't a real web standard!
Of course it's not! The style laid out here is not affiliated with any official web
standards groups, which is why this repo is called standard/standard and not
ECMA/standard.
The word "standard" has more meanings than just "web standard" :-) For example:

This module helps hold our code to a high standard of quality.
This module ensures that new contributors follow some basic style standards.

Is there an automatic formatter?
Yes! You can use standard --fix to fix most issues automatically.
standard --fix is built into standard for maximum convenience. Most problems
are fixable, but some errors (like forgetting to handle errors) must be fixed
manually.
To save you time, standard outputs the message "Run standard --fix to automatically fix some problems" when it detects problems that can be fixed
automatically.
How do I ignore files?
Certain paths (node_modules/, coverage/, vendor/, *.min.js,
and files/folders that begin with . like .git/) are automatically ignored.
Paths in a project's root .gitignore file are also automatically ignored.
Sometimes you need to ignore additional folders or specific minified files. To do
that, add a standard.ignore property to package.json:
"standard": {
  "ignore": [
    "**/out/",
    "/lib/select2/",
    "/lib/ckeditor/",
    "tmp.js"
  ]
}
How do I disable a rule?
In rare cases, you'll need to break a rule and hide the error generated by
standard.
JavaScript Standard Style uses ESLint under-the-hood and
you can hide errors as you normally would if you used ESLint directly.
Disable all rules on a specific line:
file = 'I know what I am doing' // eslint-disable-line
Or, disable only the "no-use-before-define" rule:
file = 'I know what I am doing' // eslint-disable-line no-use-before-define
Or, disable the "no-use-before-define" rule for multiple lines:
/* eslint-disable no-use-before-define */
console.log('offending code goes here...')
console.log('offending code goes here...')
console.log('offending code goes here...')
/* eslint-enable no-use-before-define */
I use a library that pollutes the global namespace. How do I prevent "variable is not defined" errors?
Some packages (e.g. mocha) put their functions (e.g. describe, it) on the
global object (poor form!). Since these functions are not defined or require'd
anywhere in your code, standard will warn that you're using a variable that is
not defined (usually, this rule is really useful for catching typos!). But we want
to disable it for these global variables.
To let standard (as well as humans reading your code) know that certain variables
are global in your code, add this to the top of your file:
/* global myVar1, myVar2 */
If you have hundreds of files, it may be desirable to avoid adding comments to
every file. In this case, run:
$ standard --global myVar1 --global myVar2
Or, add this to package.json:
{
  "standard": {
    "globals": [ "myVar1", "myVar2" ]
  }
}
Note: global and globals are equivalent.
How do I use experimental JavaScript (ES Next) features?
standard supports the latest ECMAScript features, ES8 (ES2017), including
language feature proposals that are in "Stage 4" of the proposal process.
To support experimental language features, standard supports specifying a
custom JavaScript parser. Before using a custom parser, consider whether the added
complexity is worth it.
To use a custom parser, first install it from npm:
npm install @babel/eslint-parser --save-dev
Then run:
$ standard --parser @babel/eslint-parser
Or, add this to package.json:
{
  "standard": {
    "parser": "@babel/eslint-parser"
  }
}
Can I use a JavaScript language variant, like Flow or TypeScript?
standard supports the latest ECMAScript features. However, Flow and TypeScript add new
syntax to the language, so they are not supported out-of-the-box.
For TypeScript, an official variant ts-standard is supported and maintained that provides a very
similar experience to standard.
For other JavaScript language variants, standard supports specifying a custom JavaScript
parser as well as an ESLint plugin to handle the changed syntax. Before using a JavaScript
language variant, consider whether the added complexity is worth it.
TypeScript
ts-standard is the officially supported variant for
TypeScript. ts-standard supports all the same rules and options as standard and includes
additional TypeScript specific rules. ts-standard will even lint regular javascript files
by setting the configuration in tsconfig.json.
npm install ts-standard --save-dev
Then run (where tsconfig.json is located in the working directory):
$ ts-standard
Or, add this to package.json:
{
  "ts-standard": {
    "project": "./tsconfig.json"
  }
}
Note: To include additional files in linting such as test files, create a tsconfig.eslint.json file to use instead.
If you really want to configure hundreds of ESLint rules individually, you can always use eslint
directly with eslint-config-standard-with-typescript
to layer your changes on top.
Flow
To use Flow, you need to run standard with @babel/eslint-parser as the parser and
eslint-plugin-flowtype as a plugin.
npm install @babel/eslint-parser eslint-plugin-flowtype --save-dev
Then run:
$ standard --parser @babel/eslint-parser --plugin flowtype
Or, add this to package.json:
{
  "standard": {
    "parser": "@babel/eslint-parser",
    "plugins": [ "flowtype" ]
  }
}
Note: plugin and plugins are equivalent.
What about Mocha, Jest, Jasmine, QUnit, etc?
To support mocha in test files, add this to the top of the test files:
/* eslint-env mocha */
Or, run:
$ standard --env mocha
Where mocha can be one of jest, jasmine, qunit, phantomjs, and so on. To see a
full list, check ESLint's
specifying environments
documentation. For a list of what globals are available for these environments,
check the
globals npm
module.
Note: env and envs are equivalent.
What about Web Workers and Service Workers?
Add this to the top of web worker files:
/* eslint-env worker */
This lets standard (as well as humans reading the code) know that self is a
global in web worker code.
For Service workers, add this instead:
/* eslint-env serviceworker */
What is the difference between warnings and errors?
standard treats all rule violations as errors, which means that standard
will exit with a non-zero (error) exit code.
However, we may occasionally release a new major version of standard
which changes a rule that affects the majority of standard users (for example,
transitioning from var to let/const). We do this only when we think the
advantage is worth the cost and only when the rule is
auto-fixable.
In these situations, we have a "transition period" where the rule change is only
a "warning". Warnings don't cause standard to return a non-zero (error)
exit code. However, a warning message will still print to the console. During
the transition period, using standard --fix will update your code so that it's
ready for the next major version.
The slow and careful approach is what we strive for with standard. We're
generally extremely conservative in enforcing the usage of new language
features. We want using standard to be light and fun and so we're careful
about making changes that may get in your way. As always, you can
disable a rule at any time, if necessary.
Can I check code inside of Markdown or HTML files?
To check code inside Markdown files, use standard-markdown.
Alternatively, there are ESLint plugins that can check code inside Markdown, HTML,
and many other types of language files:
To check code inside Markdown files, use an ESLint plugin:
$ npm install eslint-plugin-markdown
Then, to check JS that appears inside code blocks, run:
$ standard --plugin markdown '**/*.md'
To check code inside HTML files, use an ESLint plugin:
$ npm install eslint-plugin-html
Then, to check JS that appears inside <script> tags, run:
$ standard --plugin html '**/*.html'
Is there a Git pre-commit hook?
Yes! Hooks are great for ensuring that unstyled code never even makes it into your repo.
Never give style feedback on a pull request again!
You even have a choice...
Install your own hook
#!/bin/bash

# Ensure all JavaScript files staged for commit pass standard code style
function xargs-r() {
  # Portable version of "xargs -r". The -r flag is a GNU extension that
  # prevents xargs from running if there are no input files.
  if IFS= read -r -d $'\n' path; then
    echo "$path" | cat - | xargs "$@"
  fi
}
git diff --name-only --cached --relative | grep '\.jsx\?$' | sed 's/[^[:alnum:]]/\\&/g' | xargs-r -E '' -t standard
if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then
  echo 'JavaScript Standard Style errors were detected. Aborting commit.'
  exit 1
fi
Use a pre-commit hook
The pre-commit library allows hooks to be declared within a .pre-commit-config.yaml configuration file in the repo, and therefore more easily maintained across a team.
Users of pre-commit can simply add standard to their .pre-commit-config.yaml file, which will automatically fix .js, .jsx, .mjs and .cjs files:
  - repo: https://github.com/standard/standard
    rev: master
    hooks:
      - id: standard
Alternatively, for more advanced styling configurations, use standard within the eslint hook:
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-eslint
    rev: master
    hooks:
      - id: eslint
        files: \.[jt]sx?$  # *.js, *.jsx, *.ts and *.tsx
        types: [file]
        additional_dependencies:
          - eslint@latest
          - eslint-config-standard@latest
          # and whatever other plugins...
How do I make the output all colorful and pretty?
The built-in output is simple and straightforward, but if you like shiny things,
install snazzy:
$ npm install snazzy
And run:
$ standard | snazzy
There's also standard-tap,
standard-json,
standard-reporter, and
standard-summary.
Is there a Node.js API?
Yes!
async standard.lintText(text, [opts])
Lint the provided source text. An opts object may be provided:
{
  // unique to lintText
  filename: '',         // path of file containing the text being linted

  // common to lintText and lintFiles
  cwd: '',              // current working directory (default: process.cwd())
  fix: false,           // automatically fix problems
  extensions: [],       // file extensions to lint (has sane defaults)
  globals: [],          // custom global variables to declare
  plugins: [],          // custom eslint plugins
  envs: [],             // custom eslint environment
  parser: '',           // custom js parser (e.g. babel-eslint)
  usePackageJson: true, // use options from nearest package.json?
  useGitIgnore: true    // use file ignore patterns from .gitignore?
}
All options are optional, though some ESLint plugins require the filename option.
Additional options may be loaded from a package.json if it's found for the current working directory. See below for further details.
Returns a Promise resolving to the results or rejected with an Error.
The results object will contain the following properties:
const results = {
  results: [
    {
      filePath: '',
      messages: [
        { ruleId: '', message: '', line: 0, column: 0 }
      ],
      errorCount: 0,
      warningCount: 0,
      output: '' // fixed source code (only present with {fix: true} option)
    }
  ],
  errorCount: 0,
  warningCount: 0
}
async standard.lintFiles(files, [opts])
Lint the provided files globs. An opts object may be provided:
{
  // unique to lintFiles
  ignore: [],           // file globs to ignore (has sane defaults)

  // common to lintText and lintFiles
  cwd: '',              // current working directory (default: process.cwd())
  fix: false,           // automatically fix problems
  extensions: [],       // file extensions to lint (has sane defaults)
  globals: [],          // custom global variables to declare
  plugins: [],          // custom eslint plugins
  envs: [],             // custom eslint environment
  parser: '',           // custom js parser (e.g. babel-eslint)
  usePackageJson: true, // use options from nearest package.json?
  useGitIgnore: true    // use file ignore patterns from .gitignore?
}
Additional options may be loaded from a package.json if it's found for the current working directory. See below for further details.
Both ignore and files patterns are resolved relative to the current working directory.
Returns a Promise resolving to the results or rejected with an Error (same as above).

dotenv 

Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology.

üå± Install
npm install dotenv --save
You can also use an npm-compatible package manager like yarn or bun:
yarn add dotenv
# or
bun add dotenv
üèóÔ∏è Usage






Create a .env file in the root of your project (if using a monorepo structure like apps/backend/app.js, put it in the root of the folder where your app.js process runs):
S3_BUCKET="YOURS3BUCKET"
SECRET_KEY="YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE"
As early as possible in your application, import and configure dotenv:
require('dotenv').config()
console.log(process.env) // remove this after you've confirmed it is working
.. or using ES6?
import 'dotenv/config'
That's it. process.env now has the keys and values you defined in your .env file:
require('dotenv').config()
// or import 'dotenv/config' if you're using ES6

...

s3.getBucketCors({Bucket: process.env.S3_BUCKET}, function(err, data) {})
Multiline values
If you need multiline variables, for example private keys, those are now supported (>= v15.0.0) with line breaks:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
...
Kh9NV...
...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
Alternatively, you can double quote strings and use the \n character:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nKh9NV...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
Comments
Comments may be added to your file on their own line or inline:
# This is a comment
SECRET_KEY=YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE # comment
SECRET_HASH="something-with-a-#-hash"
Comments begin where a # exists, so if your value contains a # please wrap it in quotes. This is a breaking change from >= v15.0.0 and on.
Parsing
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Preload

Note: Consider using dotenvx instead of preloading. I am now doing (and recommending) so.
It serves the same purpose (you do not need to require and load dotenv), adds better debugging, and works with ANY language, framework, or platform. ‚Äì motdotla

You can use the --require (-r) command line option to preload dotenv. By doing this, you do not need to require and load dotenv in your application code.
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
The configuration options below are supported as command line arguments in the format dotenv_config_<option>=value
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env dotenv_config_debug=true
Additionally, you can use environment variables to set configuration options. Command line arguments will precede these.
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_<OPTION>=value node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_ENCODING=latin1 DOTENV_CONFIG_DEBUG=true node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env
Variable Expansion
You need to add the value of another variable in one of your variables? Use dotenv-expand.
Command Substitution
Use dotenvx to use command substitution.
Add the output of a command to one of your variables in your .env file.
# .env
DATABASE_URL="postgres://$(whoami)@localhost/my_database"
// index.js
console.log('DATABASE_URL', process.env.DATABASE_URL)
$ dotenvx run --debug -- node index.js
[dotenvx@0.14.1] injecting env (1) from .env
DATABASE_URL postgres://yourusername@localhost/my_database
Syncing
You need to keep .env files in sync between machines, environments, or team members? Use dotenvx to encrypt your .env files and safely include them in source control. This still subscribes to the twelve-factor app rules by generating a decryption key separate from code.
Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx to generate .env.ci, .env.production files, and more.
Deploying
You need to deploy your secrets in a cloud-agnostic manner? Use dotenvx to generate a private decryption key that is set on your production server.
üå¥ Manage Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx
Run any environment locally. Create a .env.ENVIRONMENT file and use --env-file to load it. It's straightforward, yet flexible.
$ echo "HELLO=production" > .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.production -- node index.js
Hello production
> ^^
or with multiple .env files
$ echo "HELLO=local" > .env.local
$ echo "HELLO=World" > .env
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.local --env-file=.env -- node index.js
Hello local
more environment examples
üöÄ Deploying
Use dotenvx.
Add encryption to your .env files with a single command. Pass the --encrypt flag.
$ dotenvx set HELLO Production --encrypt -f .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION="<.env.production private key>" dotenvx run -- node index.js
[dotenvx] injecting env (2) from .env.production
Hello Production

üìñ Documentation
Dotenv exposes four functions:

config
parse
populate
decrypt

Config
config will read your .env file, parse the contents, assign it to
process.env,
and return an Object with a parsed key containing the loaded content or an error key if it failed.
const result = dotenv.config()

if (result.error) {
  throw result.error
}

console.log(result.parsed)
You can additionally, pass options to config.
Options
path
Default: path.resolve(process.cwd(), '.env')
Specify a custom path if your file containing environment variables is located elsewhere.
require('dotenv').config({ path: '/custom/path/to/.env' })
By default, config will look for a file called .env in the current working directory.
Pass in multiple files as an array, and they will be parsed in order and combined with process.env (or option.processEnv, if set). The first value set for a variable will win, unless the options.override flag is set, in which case the last value set will win.  If a value already exists in process.env and the options.override flag is NOT set, no changes will be made to that value.
require('dotenv').config({ path: ['.env.local', '.env'] })
encoding
Default: utf8
Specify the encoding of your file containing environment variables.
require('dotenv').config({ encoding: 'latin1' })
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
require('dotenv').config({ debug: process.env.DEBUG })
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set on your machine with values from your .env file(s). If multiple files have been provided in option.path the override will also be used as each file is combined with the next. Without override being set, the first value wins. With override set the last value wins.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
processEnv
Default: process.env
Specify an object to write your environment variables to. Defaults to process.env environment variables.
const myObject = {}
require('dotenv').config({ processEnv: myObject })

console.log(myObject) // values from .env
console.log(process.env) // this was not changed or written to
Parse
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment
variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return
an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Options
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('hello world')
const opt = { debug: true }
const config = dotenv.parse(buf, opt)
// expect a debug message because the buffer is not in KEY=VAL form
Populate
The engine which populates the contents of your .env file to process.env is available for use. It accepts a target, a source, and options. This is useful for power users who want to supply their own objects.
For example, customizing the source:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'world' }

dotenv.populate(process.env, parsed)

console.log(process.env.HELLO) // world
For example, customizing the source AND target:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'universe' }
const target = { HELLO: 'world' } // empty object

dotenv.populate(target, parsed, { override: true, debug: true })

console.log(target) // { HELLO: 'universe' }
options
Debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being populated as you expect.
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set.
‚ùì FAQ
Why is the .env file not loading my environment variables successfully?
Most likely your .env file is not in the correct place. See this stack overflow.
Turn on debug mode and try again..
require('dotenv').config({ debug: true })
You will receive a helpful error outputted to your console.
Should I commit my .env file?
No. We strongly recommend against committing your .env file to version
control. It should only include environment-specific values such as database
passwords or API keys. Your production database should have a different
password than your development database.
Should I have multiple .env files?
We recommend creating one .env file per environment. Use .env for local/development, .env.production for production and so on. This still follows the twelve factor principles as each is attributed individually to its own environment. Avoid custom set ups that work in inheritance somehow (.env.production inherits values form .env for example). It is better to duplicate values if necessary across each .env.environment file.

In a twelve-factor app, env vars are granular controls, each fully orthogonal to other env vars. They are never grouped together as ‚Äúenvironments‚Äù, but instead are independently managed for each deploy. This is a model that scales up smoothly as the app naturally expands into more deploys over its lifetime.
‚Äì The Twelve-Factor App

What rules does the parsing engine follow?
The parsing engine currently supports the following rules:

BASIC=basic becomes {BASIC: 'basic'}
empty lines are skipped
lines beginning with # are treated as comments
# marks the beginning of a comment (unless when the value is wrapped in quotes)
empty values become empty strings (EMPTY= becomes {EMPTY: ''})
inner quotes are maintained (think JSON) (JSON={"foo": "bar"} becomes {JSON:"{\"foo\": \"bar\"}")
whitespace is removed from both ends of unquoted values (see more on trim) (FOO=  some value   becomes {FOO: 'some value'})
single and double quoted values are escaped (SINGLE_QUOTE='quoted' becomes {SINGLE_QUOTE: "quoted"})
single and double quoted values maintain whitespace from both ends (FOO="  some value  " becomes {FOO: '  some value  '})
double quoted values expand new lines (MULTILINE="new\nline" becomes

{MULTILINE: 'new
line'}


backticks are supported (BACKTICK_KEY=`This has 'single' and "double" quotes inside of it.`)

What happens to environment variables that were already set?
By default, we will never modify any environment variables that have already been set. In particular, if there is a variable in your .env file which collides with one that already exists in your environment, then that variable will be skipped.
If instead, you want to override process.env use the override option.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
How come my environment variables are not showing up for React?
Your React code is run in Webpack, where the fs module or even the process global itself are not accessible out-of-the-box. process.env can only be injected through Webpack configuration.
If you are using react-scripts, which is distributed through create-react-app, it has dotenv built in but with a quirk. Preface your environment variables with REACT_APP_. See this stack overflow for more details.
If you are using other frameworks (e.g. Next.js, Gatsby...), you need to consult their documentation for how to inject environment variables into the client.
Can I customize/write plugins for dotenv?
Yes! dotenv.config() returns an object representing the parsed .env file. This gives you everything you need to continue setting values on process.env. For example:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const variableExpansion = require('dotenv-expand')
const myEnv = dotenv.config()
variableExpansion(myEnv)
How do I use dotenv with import?
Simply..
// index.mjs (ESM)
import 'dotenv/config' // see https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#how-do-i-use-dotenv-with-import
import express from 'express'
A little background..

When you run a module containing an import declaration, the modules it imports are loaded first, then each module body is executed in a depth-first traversal of the dependency graph, avoiding cycles by skipping anything already executed.
‚Äì ES6 In Depth: Modules

What does this mean in plain language? It means you would think the following would work but it won't.
errorReporter.mjs:
class Client {
  constructor (apiKey) {
    console.log('apiKey', apiKey)

    this.apiKey = apiKey
  }
}

export default new Client(process.env.API_KEY)
index.mjs:
// Note: this is INCORRECT and will not work
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv'
dotenv.config()

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs' // process.env.API_KEY will be blank!
process.env.API_KEY will be blank.
Instead, index.mjs should be written as..
import 'dotenv/config'

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs'
Does that make sense? It's a bit unintuitive, but it is how importing of ES6 modules work. Here is a working example of this pitfall.
There are two alternatives to this approach:

Preload dotenv: node --require dotenv/config index.js (Note: you do not need to import dotenv with this approach)
Create a separate file that will execute config first as outlined in this comment on #133

Why am I getting the error Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'crypto|os|path'?
You are using dotenv on the front-end and have not included a polyfill. Webpack < 5 used to include these for you. Do the following:
npm install node-polyfill-webpack-plugin
Configure your webpack.config.js to something like the following.
require('dotenv').config()

const path = require('path');
const webpack = require('webpack')

const NodePolyfillPlugin = require('node-polyfill-webpack-plugin')

module.exports = {
  mode: 'development',
  entry: './src/index.ts',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  plugins: [
    new NodePolyfillPlugin(),
    new webpack.DefinePlugin({
      'process.env': {
        HELLO: JSON.stringify(process.env.HELLO)
      }
    }),
  ]
};
Alternatively, just use dotenv-webpack which does this and more behind the scenes for you.
What about variable expansion?
Try dotenv-expand
What about syncing and securing .env files?
Use dotenvx
What if I accidentally commit my .env file to code?
Remove it, remove git history and then install the git pre-commit hook to prevent this from ever happening again.
brew install dotenvx/brew/dotenvx
dotenvx precommit --install

How can I prevent committing my .env file to a Docker build?
Use the docker prebuild hook.
# Dockerfile
...
RUN curl -fsS https://dotenvx.sh/ | sh
...
RUN dotenvx prebuild
CMD ["dotenvx", "run", "--", "node", "index.js"]

dotenv 

Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology.

üå± Install
npm install dotenv --save
You can also use an npm-compatible package manager like yarn or bun:
yarn add dotenv
# or
bun add dotenv
üèóÔ∏è Usage






Create a .env file in the root of your project (if using a monorepo structure like apps/backend/app.js, put it in the root of the folder where your app.js process runs):
S3_BUCKET="YOURS3BUCKET"
SECRET_KEY="YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE"
As early as possible in your application, import and configure dotenv:
require('dotenv').config()
console.log(process.env) // remove this after you've confirmed it is working
.. or using ES6?
import 'dotenv/config'
That's it. process.env now has the keys and values you defined in your .env file:
require('dotenv').config()
// or import 'dotenv/config' if you're using ES6

...

s3.getBucketCors({Bucket: process.env.S3_BUCKET}, function(err, data) {})
Multiline values
If you need multiline variables, for example private keys, those are now supported (>= v15.0.0) with line breaks:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
...
Kh9NV...
...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
Alternatively, you can double quote strings and use the \n character:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nKh9NV...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
Comments
Comments may be added to your file on their own line or inline:
# This is a comment
SECRET_KEY=YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE # comment
SECRET_HASH="something-with-a-#-hash"
Comments begin where a # exists, so if your value contains a # please wrap it in quotes. This is a breaking change from >= v15.0.0 and on.
Parsing
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Preload

Note: Consider using dotenvx instead of preloading. I am now doing (and recommending) so.
It serves the same purpose (you do not need to require and load dotenv), adds better debugging, and works with ANY language, framework, or platform. ‚Äì motdotla

You can use the --require (-r) command line option to preload dotenv. By doing this, you do not need to require and load dotenv in your application code.
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
The configuration options below are supported as command line arguments in the format dotenv_config_<option>=value
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env dotenv_config_debug=true
Additionally, you can use environment variables to set configuration options. Command line arguments will precede these.
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_<OPTION>=value node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_ENCODING=latin1 DOTENV_CONFIG_DEBUG=true node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env
Variable Expansion
You need to add the value of another variable in one of your variables? Use dotenv-expand.
Command Substitution
Use dotenvx to use command substitution.
Add the output of a command to one of your variables in your .env file.
# .env
DATABASE_URL="postgres://$(whoami)@localhost/my_database"
// index.js
console.log('DATABASE_URL', process.env.DATABASE_URL)
$ dotenvx run --debug -- node index.js
[dotenvx@0.14.1] injecting env (1) from .env
DATABASE_URL postgres://yourusername@localhost/my_database
Syncing
You need to keep .env files in sync between machines, environments, or team members? Use dotenvx to encrypt your .env files and safely include them in source control. This still subscribes to the twelve-factor app rules by generating a decryption key separate from code.
Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx to generate .env.ci, .env.production files, and more.
Deploying
You need to deploy your secrets in a cloud-agnostic manner? Use dotenvx to generate a private decryption key that is set on your production server.
üå¥ Manage Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx
Run any environment locally. Create a .env.ENVIRONMENT file and use --env-file to load it. It's straightforward, yet flexible.
$ echo "HELLO=production" > .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.production -- node index.js
Hello production
> ^^
or with multiple .env files
$ echo "HELLO=local" > .env.local
$ echo "HELLO=World" > .env
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.local --env-file=.env -- node index.js
Hello local
more environment examples
üöÄ Deploying
Use dotenvx.
Add encryption to your .env files with a single command. Pass the --encrypt flag.
$ dotenvx set HELLO Production --encrypt -f .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION="<.env.production private key>" dotenvx run -- node index.js
[dotenvx] injecting env (2) from .env.production
Hello Production

üìñ Documentation
Dotenv exposes four functions:

config
parse
populate
decrypt

Config
config will read your .env file, parse the contents, assign it to
process.env,
and return an Object with a parsed key containing the loaded content or an error key if it failed.
const result = dotenv.config()

if (result.error) {
  throw result.error
}

console.log(result.parsed)
You can additionally, pass options to config.
Options
path
Default: path.resolve(process.cwd(), '.env')
Specify a custom path if your file containing environment variables is located elsewhere.
require('dotenv').config({ path: '/custom/path/to/.env' })
By default, config will look for a file called .env in the current working directory.
Pass in multiple files as an array, and they will be parsed in order and combined with process.env (or option.processEnv, if set). The first value set for a variable will win, unless the options.override flag is set, in which case the last value set will win.  If a value already exists in process.env and the options.override flag is NOT set, no changes will be made to that value.
require('dotenv').config({ path: ['.env.local', '.env'] })
encoding
Default: utf8
Specify the encoding of your file containing environment variables.
require('dotenv').config({ encoding: 'latin1' })
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
require('dotenv').config({ debug: process.env.DEBUG })
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set on your machine with values from your .env file(s). If multiple files have been provided in option.path the override will also be used as each file is combined with the next. Without override being set, the first value wins. With override set the last value wins.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
processEnv
Default: process.env
Specify an object to write your environment variables to. Defaults to process.env environment variables.
const myObject = {}
require('dotenv').config({ processEnv: myObject })

console.log(myObject) // values from .env
console.log(process.env) // this was not changed or written to
Parse
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment
variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return
an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Options
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('hello world')
const opt = { debug: true }
const config = dotenv.parse(buf, opt)
// expect a debug message because the buffer is not in KEY=VAL form
Populate
The engine which populates the contents of your .env file to process.env is available for use. It accepts a target, a source, and options. This is useful for power users who want to supply their own objects.
For example, customizing the source:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'world' }

dotenv.populate(process.env, parsed)

console.log(process.env.HELLO) // world
For example, customizing the source AND target:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'universe' }
const target = { HELLO: 'world' } // empty object

dotenv.populate(target, parsed, { override: true, debug: true })

console.log(target) // { HELLO: 'universe' }
options
Debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being populated as you expect.
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set.
‚ùì FAQ
Why is the .env file not loading my environment variables successfully?
Most likely your .env file is not in the correct place. See this stack overflow.
Turn on debug mode and try again..
require('dotenv').config({ debug: true })
You will receive a helpful error outputted to your console.
Should I commit my .env file?
No. We strongly recommend against committing your .env file to version
control. It should only include environment-specific values such as database
passwords or API keys. Your production database should have a different
password than your development database.
Should I have multiple .env files?
We recommend creating one .env file per environment. Use .env for local/development, .env.production for production and so on. This still follows the twelve factor principles as each is attributed individually to its own environment. Avoid custom set ups that work in inheritance somehow (.env.production inherits values form .env for example). It is better to duplicate values if necessary across each .env.environment file.

In a twelve-factor app, env vars are granular controls, each fully orthogonal to other env vars. They are never grouped together as ‚Äúenvironments‚Äù, but instead are independently managed for each deploy. This is a model that scales up smoothly as the app naturally expands into more deploys over its lifetime.
‚Äì The Twelve-Factor App

What rules does the parsing engine follow?
The parsing engine currently supports the following rules:

BASIC=basic becomes {BASIC: 'basic'}
empty lines are skipped
lines beginning with # are treated as comments
# marks the beginning of a comment (unless when the value is wrapped in quotes)
empty values become empty strings (EMPTY= becomes {EMPTY: ''})
inner quotes are maintained (think JSON) (JSON={"foo": "bar"} becomes {JSON:"{\"foo\": \"bar\"}")
whitespace is removed from both ends of unquoted values (see more on trim) (FOO=  some value   becomes {FOO: 'some value'})
single and double quoted values are escaped (SINGLE_QUOTE='quoted' becomes {SINGLE_QUOTE: "quoted"})
single and double quoted values maintain whitespace from both ends (FOO="  some value  " becomes {FOO: '  some value  '})
double quoted values expand new lines (MULTILINE="new\nline" becomes

{MULTILINE: 'new
line'}


backticks are supported (BACKTICK_KEY=`This has 'single' and "double" quotes inside of it.`)

What happens to environment variables that were already set?
By default, we will never modify any environment variables that have already been set. In particular, if there is a variable in your .env file which collides with one that already exists in your environment, then that variable will be skipped.
If instead, you want to override process.env use the override option.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
How come my environment variables are not showing up for React?
Your React code is run in Webpack, where the fs module or even the process global itself are not accessible out-of-the-box. process.env can only be injected through Webpack configuration.
If you are using react-scripts, which is distributed through create-react-app, it has dotenv built in but with a quirk. Preface your environment variables with REACT_APP_. See this stack overflow for more details.
If you are using other frameworks (e.g. Next.js, Gatsby...), you need to consult their documentation for how to inject environment variables into the client.
Can I customize/write plugins for dotenv?
Yes! dotenv.config() returns an object representing the parsed .env file. This gives you everything you need to continue setting values on process.env. For example:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const variableExpansion = require('dotenv-expand')
const myEnv = dotenv.config()
variableExpansion(myEnv)
How do I use dotenv with import?
Simply..
// index.mjs (ESM)
import 'dotenv/config' // see https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#how-do-i-use-dotenv-with-import
import express from 'express'
A little background..

When you run a module containing an import declaration, the modules it imports are loaded first, then each module body is executed in a depth-first traversal of the dependency graph, avoiding cycles by skipping anything already executed.
‚Äì ES6 In Depth: Modules

What does this mean in plain language? It means you would think the following would work but it won't.
errorReporter.mjs:
class Client {
  constructor (apiKey) {
    console.log('apiKey', apiKey)

    this.apiKey = apiKey
  }
}

export default new Client(process.env.API_KEY)
index.mjs:
// Note: this is INCORRECT and will not work
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv'
dotenv.config()

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs' // process.env.API_KEY will be blank!
process.env.API_KEY will be blank.
Instead, index.mjs should be written as..
import 'dotenv/config'

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs'
Does that make sense? It's a bit unintuitive, but it is how importing of ES6 modules work. Here is a working example of this pitfall.
There are two alternatives to this approach:

Preload dotenv: node --require dotenv/config index.js (Note: you do not need to import dotenv with this approach)
Create a separate file that will execute config first as outlined in this comment on #133

Why am I getting the error Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'crypto|os|path'?
You are using dotenv on the front-end and have not included a polyfill. Webpack < 5 used to include these for you. Do the following:
npm install node-polyfill-webpack-plugin
Configure your webpack.config.js to something like the following.
require('dotenv').config()

const path = require('path');
const webpack = require('webpack')

const NodePolyfillPlugin = require('node-polyfill-webpack-plugin')

module.exports = {
  mode: 'development',
  entry: './src/index.ts',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  plugins: [
    new NodePolyfillPlugin(),
    new webpack.DefinePlugin({
      'process.env': {
        HELLO: JSON.stringify(process.env.HELLO)
      }
    }),
  ]
};
Alternatively, just use dotenv-webpack which does this and more behind the scenes for you.
What about variable expansion?
Try dotenv-expand
What about syncing and securing .env files?
Use dotenvx
What if I accidentally commit my .env file to code?
Remove it, remove git history and then install the git pre-commit hook to prevent this from ever happening again.
brew install dotenvx/brew/dotenvx
dotenvx precommit --install

How can I prevent committing my .env file to a Docker build?
Use the docker prebuild hook.
# Dockerfile
...
RUN curl -fsS https://dotenvx.sh/ | sh
...
RUN dotenvx prebuild
CMD ["dotenvx", "run", "--", "node", "index.js"]

Who's using dotenv?
These npm modules depend on it.
Projects that expand it often use the keyword "dotenv" on npm.

Multiline values
If you need multiline variables, for example private keys, those are now supported (>= v15.0.0) with line breaks:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
...
Kh9NV...
...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
Alternatively, you can double quote strings and use the \n character:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nKh9NV...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
Comments
Comments may be added to your file on their own line or inline:
# This is a comment
SECRET_KEY=YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE # comment
SECRET_HASH="something-with-a-#-hash"
Comments begin where a # exists, so if your value contains a # please wrap it in quotes. This is a breaking change from >= v15.0.0 and on.
Parsing
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Preload

Note: Consider using dotenvx instead of preloading. I am now doing (and recommending) so.
It serves the same purpose (you do not need to require and load dotenv), adds better debugging, and works with ANY language, framework, or platform. ‚Äì motdotla

You can use the --require (-r) command line option to preload dotenv. By doing this, you do not need to require and load dotenv in your application code.
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
The configuration options below are supported as command line arguments in the format dotenv_config_<option>=value
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env dotenv_config_debug=true
Additionally, you can use environment variables to set configuration options. Command line arguments will precede these.
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_<OPTION>=value node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_ENCODING=latin1 DOTENV_CONFIG_DEBUG=true node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env
Variable Expansion
You need to add the value of another variable in one of your variables? Use dotenv-expand.
Command Substitution
Use dotenvx to use command substitution.
Add the output of a command to one of your variables in your .env file.
# .env
DATABASE_URL="postgres://$(whoami)@localhost/my_database"
// index.js
console.log('DATABASE_URL', process.env.DATABASE_URL)
$ dotenvx run --debug -- node index.js
[dotenvx@0.14.1] injecting env (1) from .env
DATABASE_URL postgres://yourusername@localhost/my_database
Syncing
You need to keep .env files in sync between machines, environments, or team members? Use dotenvx to encrypt your .env files and safely include them in source control. This still subscribes to the twelve-factor app rules by generating a decryption key separate from code.
Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx to generate .env.ci, .env.production files, and more.
Deploying
You need to deploy your secrets in a cloud-agnostic manner? Use dotenvx to generate a private decryption key that is set on your production server.
üå¥ Manage Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx
Run any environment locally. Create a .env.ENVIRONMENT file and use --env-file to load it. It's straightforward, yet flexible.
$ echo "HELLO=production" > .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.production -- node index.js
Hello production
> ^^
or with multiple .env files
$ echo "HELLO=local" > .env.local
$ echo "HELLO=World" > .env
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.local --env-file=.env -- node index.js
Hello local

üöÄ Deploying
Use dotenvx.
Add encryption to your .env files with a single command. Pass the --encrypt flag.
$ dotenvx set HELLO Production --encrypt -f .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION="<.env.production private key>" dotenvx run -- node index.js

üìñ Documentation
Dotenv exposes four functions:

config
parse
populate
decrypt

Config
config will read your .env file, parse the contents, assign it to
process.env,
and return an Object with a parsed key containing the loaded content or an error key if it failed.
const result = dotenv.config()

if (result.error) {
  throw result.error
}

console.log(result.parsed)
You can additionally, pass options to config.
Options
path
Default: path.resolve(process.cwd(), '.env')
Specify a custom path if your file containing environment variables is located elsewhere.
require('dotenv').config({ path: '/custom/path/to/.env' })
By default, config will look for a file called .env in the current working directory.
Pass in multiple files as an array, and they will be parsed in order and combined with process.env (or option.processEnv, if set). The first value set for a variable will win, unless the options.override flag is set, in which case the last value set will win.  If a value already exists in process.env and the options.override flag is NOT set, no changes will be made to that value.
require('dotenv').config({ path: ['.env.local', '.env'] })
encoding
Default: utf8
Specify the encoding of your file containing environment variables.
require('dotenv').config({ encoding: 'latin1' })
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
require('dotenv').config({ debug: process.env.DEBUG })
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set on your machine with values from your .env file(s). If multiple files have been provided in option.path the override will also be used as each file is combined with the next. Without override being set, the first value wins. With override set the last value wins.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
processEnv
Default: process.env
Specify an object to write your environment variables to. Defaults to process.env environment variables.
const myObject = {}
require('dotenv').config({ processEnv: myObject })

console.log(myObject) // values from .env
console.log(process.env) // this was not changed or written to
Parse
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment
variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return
an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Options
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('hello world')
const opt = { debug: true }
const config = dotenv.parse(buf, opt)
// expect a debug message because the buffer is not in KEY=VAL form
Populate
The engine which populates the contents of your .env file to process.env is available for use. It accepts a target, a source, and options. This is useful for power users who want to supply their own objects.
For example, customizing the source:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'world' }

dotenv.populate(process.env, parsed)

console.log(process.env.HELLO) // world
For example, customizing the source AND target:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'universe' }
const target = { HELLO: 'world' } // empty object

dotenv.populate(target, parsed, { override: true, debug: true })

console.log(target) // { HELLO: 'universe' }
options
Debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being populated as you expect.
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set.
‚ùì FAQ
Why is the .env file not loading my environment variables successfully?
Most likely your .env file is not in the correct place. See this stack overflow.
Turn on debug mode and try again..
require('dotenv').config({ debug: true })
You will receive a helpful error outputted to your console.
Should I commit my .env file?
No. We strongly recommend against committing your .env file to version
control. It should only include environment-specific values such as database
passwords or API keys. Your production database should have a different
password than your development database.
Should I have multiple .env files?
We recommend creating one .env file per environment. Use .env for local/development, .env.production for production and so on. This still follows the twelve factor principles as each is attributed individually to its own environment. Avoid custom set ups that work in inheritance somehow (.env.production inherits values form .env for example). It is better to duplicate values if necessary across each .env.environment file.

In a twelve-factor app, env vars are granular controls, each fully orthogonal to other env vars. They are never grouped together as ‚Äúenvironments‚Äù, but instead are independently managed for each deploy. This is a model that scales up smoothly as the app naturally expands into more deploys over its lifetime.
‚Äì The Twelve-Factor App

What rules does the parsing engine follow?
The parsing engine currently supports the following rules:

BASIC=basic becomes {BASIC: 'basic'}
empty lines are skipped
lines beginning with # are treated as comments
# marks the beginning of a comment (unless when the value is wrapped in quotes)
empty values become empty strings (EMPTY= becomes {EMPTY: ''})
inner quotes are maintained (think JSON) (JSON={"foo": "bar"} becomes {JSON:"{\"foo\": \"bar\"}")
whitespace is removed from both ends of unquoted values (see more on trim) (FOO=  some value   becomes {FOO: 'some value'})
single and double quoted values are escaped (SINGLE_QUOTE='quoted' becomes {SINGLE_QUOTE: "quoted"})
single and double quoted values maintain whitespace from both ends (FOO="  some value  " becomes {FOO: '  some value  '})
double quoted values expand new lines (MULTILINE="new\nline" becomes

{MULTILINE: 'new
line'}


backticks are supported (BACKTICK_KEY=`This has 'single' and "double" quotes inside of it.`)

What happens to environment variables that were already set?
By default, we will never modify any environment variables that have already been set. In particular, if there is a variable in your .env file which collides with one that already exists in your environment, then that variable will be skipped.
If instead, you want to override process.env use the override option.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
How come my environment variables are not showing up for React?
Your React code is run in Webpack, where the fs module or even the process global itself are not accessible out-of-the-box. process.env can only be injected through Webpack configuration.
If you are using react-scripts, which is distributed through create-react-app, it has dotenv built in but with a quirk. Preface your environment variables with REACT_APP_. See this stack overflow for more details.
If you are using other frameworks (e.g. Next.js, Gatsby...), you need to consult their documentation for how to inject environment variables into the client.
Can I customize/write plugins for dotenv?
Yes! dotenv.config() returns an object representing the parsed .env file. This gives you everything you need to continue setting values on process.env. For example:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const variableExpansion = require('dotenv-expand')
const myEnv = dotenv.config()
variableExpansion(myEnv)
How do I use dotenv with import?
Simply..
// index.mjs (ESM)
import 'dotenv/config' // see https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#how-do-i-use-dotenv-with-import
import express from 'express'
A little background..

When you run a module containing an import declaration, the modules it imports are loaded first, then each module body is executed in a depth-first traversal of the dependency graph, avoiding cycles by skipping anything already executed.
‚Äì ES6 In Depth: Modules

What does this mean in plain language? It means you would think the following would work but it won't.
errorReporter.mjs:
class Client {
  constructor (apiKey) {
    console.log('apiKey', apiKey)

    this.apiKey = apiKey
  }
}

export default new Client(process.env.API_KEY)
index.mjs:
// Note: this is INCORRECT and will not work
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv'
dotenv.config()

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs' // process.env.API_KEY will be blank!
process.env.API_KEY will be blank.
Instead, index.mjs should be written as..
import 'dotenv/config'

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs'
Does that make sense? It's a bit unintuitive, but it is how importing of ES6 modules work. Here is a working example of this pitfall.
There are two alternatives to this approach:

Preload dotenv: node --require dotenv/config index.js (Note: you do not need to import dotenv with this approach)
Create a separate file that will execute config first as outlined in this comment on #133

Why am I getting the error Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'crypto|os|path'?
You are using dotenv on the front-end and have not included a polyfill. Webpack < 5 used to include these for you. Do the following:
npm install node-polyfill-webpack-plugin
Configure your webpack.config.js to something like the following.
require('dotenv').config()

const path = require('path');
const webpack = require('webpack')

const NodePolyfillPlugin = require('node-polyfill-webpack-plugin')

module.exports = {
  mode: 'development',
  entry: './src/index.ts',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  plugins: [
    new NodePolyfillPlugin(),
    new webpack.DefinePlugin({
      'process.env': {
        HELLO: JSON.stringify(process.env.HELLO)
      }
    }),
  ]
};
Alternatively, just use dotenv-webpack which does this and more behind the scenes for you.
What about variable expansion?
Try dotenv-expand
What about syncing and securing .env files?
Use dotenvx
What if I accidentally commit my .env file to code?
Remove it, remove git history and then install the git pre-commit hook to prevent this from ever happening again.
brew install dotenvx/brew/dotenvx
dotenvx precommit --install

How can I prevent committing my .env file to a Docker build?
Use the docker prebuild hook.
# Dockerfile
...
RUN curl -fsS https://dotenvx.sh/ | sh
...
RUN dotenvx prebuild
CMD ["dotenvx", "run", "--", "node", "index.js"]

dotenv 

Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology.

üå± Install
npm install dotenv --save
You can also use an npm-compatible package manager like yarn or bun:
yarn add dotenv
# or
bun add dotenv
üèóÔ∏è Usage






Create a .env file in the root of your project (if using a monorepo structure like apps/backend/app.js, put it in the root of the folder where your app.js process runs):
S3_BUCKET="YOURS3BUCKET"
SECRET_KEY="YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE"
As early as possible in your application, import and configure dotenv:
require('dotenv').config()
console.log(process.env) // remove this after you've confirmed it is working
.. or using ES6?
import 'dotenv/config'
That's it. process.env now has the keys and values you defined in your .env file:
require('dotenv').config()
// or import 'dotenv/config' if you're using ES6

...

s3.getBucketCors({Bucket: process.env.S3_BUCKET}, function(err, data) {})
Multiline values
If you need multiline variables, for example private keys, those are now supported (>= v15.0.0) with line breaks:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
...
Kh9NV...
...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
Alternatively, you can double quote strings and use the \n character:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nKh9NV...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
Comments
Comments may be added to your file on their own line or inline:
# This is a comment
SECRET_KEY=YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE # comment
SECRET_HASH="something-with-a-#-hash"
Comments begin where a # exists, so if your value contains a # please wrap it in quotes. This is a breaking change from >= v15.0.0 and on.
Parsing
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Preload

Note: Consider using dotenvx instead of preloading. I am now doing (and recommending) so.
It serves the same purpose (you do not need to require and load dotenv), adds better debugging, and works with ANY language, framework, or platform. ‚Äì motdotla

You can use the --require (-r) command line option to preload dotenv. By doing this, you do not need to require and load dotenv in your application code.
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
The configuration options below are supported as command line arguments in the format dotenv_config_<option>=value
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env dotenv_config_debug=true
Additionally, you can use environment variables to set configuration options. Command line arguments will precede these.
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_<OPTION>=value node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_ENCODING=latin1 DOTENV_CONFIG_DEBUG=true node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env
Variable Expansion
You need to add the value of another variable in one of your variables? Use dotenv-expand.
Command Substitution
Use dotenvx to use command substitution.
Add the output of a command to one of your variables in your .env file.
# .env

$ dotenvx run --debug -- node index.js

config will read your .env file, parse the contents, assign it to
process.env,
and return an Object with a parsed key containing the loaded content or an error key if it failed.
const result = dotenv.config()

if (result.error) {
  throw result.error
}

console.log(result.parsed)
You can additionally, pass options to config.
Options
path
Default: path.resolve(process.cwd(), '.env')
Specify a custom path if your file containing environment variables is located elsewhere.
require('dotenv').config({ path: '/custom/path/to/.env' })
By default, config will look for a file called .env in the current working directory.
Pass in multiple files as an array, and they will be parsed in order and combined with process.env (or option.processEnv, if set). The first value set for a variable will win, unless the options.override flag is set, in which case the last value set will win.  If a value already exists in process.env and the options.override flag is NOT set, no changes will be made to that value.
require('dotenv').config({ path: ['.env.local', '.env'] })
encoding
Default: utf8
Specify the encoding of your file containing environment variables.
require('dotenv').config({ encoding: 'latin1' })
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
require('dotenv').config({ debug: process.env.DEBUG })
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set on your machine with values from your .env file(s). If multiple files have been provided in option.path the override will also be used as each file is combined with the next. Without override being set, the first value wins. With override set the last value wins.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
processEnv
Default: process.env
Specify an object to write your environment variables to. Defaults to process.env environment variables.
const myObject = {}
require('dotenv').config({ processEnv: myObject })

console.log(myObject) // values from .env
console.log(process.env) // this was not changed or written to
Parse
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment
variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return
an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Options
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('hello world')
const opt = { debug: true }
const config = dotenv.parse(buf, opt)
// expect a debug message because the buffer is not in KEY=VAL form
Populate
The engine which populates the contents of your .env file to process.env is available for use. It accepts a target, a source, and options. This is useful for power users who want to supply their own objects.
For example, customizing the source:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'world' }

dotenv.populate(process.env, parsed)

console.log(process.env.HELLO) // world
For example, customizing the source AND target:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'universe' }
const target = { HELLO: 'world' } // empty object

dotenv.populate(target, parsed, { override: true, debug: true })

console.log(target) // { HELLO: 'universe' }
options
Debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being populated as you expect.
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set.
‚ùì FAQ
Why is the .env file not loading my environment variables successfully?
Most likely your .env file is not in the correct place. See this stack overflow.
Turn on debug mode and try again..
require('dotenv').config({ debug: true })
You will receive a helpful error outputted to your console.
Should I commit my .env file?
No. We strongly recommend against committing your .env file to version
control. It should only include environment-specific values such as database
passwords or API keys. Your production database should have a different
password than your development database.
Should I have multiple .env files?
We recommend creating one .env file per environment. Use .env for local/development, .env.production for production and so on. This still follows the twelve factor principles as each is attributed individually to its own environment. Avoid custom set ups that work in inheritance somehow (.env.production inherits values form .env for example). It is better to duplicate values if necessary across each .env.environment file.

In a twelve-factor app, env vars are granular controls, each fully orthogonal to other env vars. They are never grouped together as ‚Äúenvironments‚Äù, but instead are independently managed for each deploy. This is a model that scales up smoothly as the app naturally expands into more deploys over its lifetime.
‚Äì The Twelve-Factor App

What rules does the parsing engine follow?
The parsing engine currently supports the following rules:

BASIC=basic becomes {BASIC: 'basic'}
empty lines are skipped
lines beginning with # are treated as comments
# marks the beginning of a comment (unless when the value is wrapped in quotes)
empty values become empty strings (EMPTY= becomes {EMPTY: ''})
inner quotes are maintained (think JSON) (JSON={"foo": "bar"} becomes {JSON:"{\"foo\": \"bar\"}")
whitespace is removed from both ends of unquoted values (see more on trim) (FOO=  some value   becomes {FOO: 'some value'})
single and double quoted values are escaped (SINGLE_QUOTE='quoted' becomes {SINGLE_QUOTE: "quoted"})
single and double quoted values maintain whitespace from both ends (FOO="  some value  " becomes {FOO: '  some value  '})
double quoted values expand new lines (MULTILINE="new\nline" becomes

{MULTILINE: 'new
line'}


backticks are supported (BACKTICK_KEY=`This has 'single' and "double" quotes inside of it.`)

What happens to environment variables that were already set?
By default, we will never modify any environment variables that have already been set. In particular, if there is a variable in your .env file which collides with one that already exists in your environment, then that variable will be skipped.
If instead, you want to override process.env use the override option.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
How come my environment variables are not showing up for React?
Your React code is run in Webpack, where the fs module or even the process global itself are not accessible out-of-the-box. process.env can only be injected through Webpack configuration.
If you are using react-scripts, which is distributed through create-react-app, it has dotenv built in but with a quirk. Preface your environment variables with REACT_APP_. See this stack overflow for more details.
If you are using other frameworks (e.g. Next.js, Gatsby...), you need to consult their documentation for how to inject environment variables into the client.
Can I customize/write plugins for dotenv?
Yes! dotenv.config() returns an object representing the parsed .env file. This gives you everything you need to continue setting values on process.env. For example:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const variableExpansion = require('dotenv-expand')
const myEnv = dotenv.config()
variableExpansion(myEnv)
How do I use dotenv with import?
Simply..
// index.mjs (ESM)
import 'dotenv/config' // see https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#how-do-i-use-dotenv-with-import
import express from 'express'
A little background..

When you run a module containing an import declaration, the modules it imports are loaded first, then each module body is executed in a depth-first traversal of the dependency graph, avoiding cycles by skipping anything already executed.
‚Äì ES6 In Depth: Modules

What does this mean in plain language? It means you would think the following would work but it won't.
errorReporter.mjs:
class Client {
  constructor (apiKey) {
    console.log('apiKey', apiKey)

    this.apiKey = apiKey
  }
}

export default new Client(process.env.API_KEY)
index.mjs:
// Note: this is INCORRECT and will not work
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv'
dotenv.config()

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs' // process.env.API_KEY will be blank!
process.env.API_KEY will be blank.
Instead, index.mjs should be written as..
import 'dotenv/config'

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs'
Does that make sense? It's a bit unintuitive, but it is how importing of ES6 modules work. Here is a working example of this pitfall.
There are two alternatives to this approach:

Preload dotenv: node --require dotenv/config index.js (Note: you do not need to import dotenv with this approach)
Create a separate file that will execute config first as outlined in this comment on #133

Why am I getting the error Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'crypto|os|path'?
You are using dotenv on the front-end and have not included a polyfill. Webpack < 5 used to include these for you. Do the following:
npm install node-polyfill-webpack-plugin
Configure your webpack.config.js to something like the following.
require('dotenv').config()

const path = require('path');
const webpack = require('webpack')

const NodePolyfillPlugin = require('node-polyfill-webpack-plugin')

module.exports = {
  mode: 'development',
  entry: './src/index.ts',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  plugins: [
    new NodePolyfillPlugin(),
    new webpack.DefinePlugin({
      'process.env': {
        HELLO: JSON.stringify(process.env.HELLO)
      }
    }),
  ]
};
Alternatively, just use dotenv-webpack which does this and more behind the scenes for you.
What about variable expansion?
Try dotenv-expand
What about syncing and securing .env files?
Use dotenvx
What if I accidentally commit my .env file to code?
Remove it, remove git history and then install the git pre-commit hook to prevent this from ever happening again.
brew install dotenvx/brew/dotenvx
dotenvx precommit --install

How can I prevent committing my .env file to a Docker build?
Use the docker prebuild hook.
# Dockerfile
...
RUN curl -fsS https://dotenvx.sh/ | sh
...
RUN dotenvx prebuild
CMD ["dotenvx", "run", "--", "node", "index.js"]

dotenv 

Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology.

üå± Install
npm install dotenv --save
You can also use an npm-compatible package manager like yarn or bun:
yarn add dotenv
# or
bun add dotenv
üèóÔ∏è Usage






Create a .env file in the root of your project (if using a monorepo structure like apps/backend/app.js, put it in the root of the folder where your app.js process runs):
S3_BUCKET="YOURS3BUCKET"
SECRET_KEY="YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE"
As early as possible in your application, import and configure dotenv:
require('dotenv').config()
console.log(process.env) // remove this after you've confirmed it is working
.. or using ES6?
import 'dotenv/config'
That's it. process.env now has the keys and values you defined in your .env file:
require('dotenv').config()
// or import 'dotenv/config' if you're using ES6

...

s3.getBucketCors({Bucket: process.env.S3_BUCKET}, function(err, data) {})
Multiline values
If you need multiline variables, for example private keys, those are now supported (>= v15.0.0) with line breaks:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
...
Kh9NV...
...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
Alternatively, you can double quote strings and use the \n character:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nKh9NV...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
Comments
Comments may be added to your file on their own line or inline:
# This is a comment
SECRET_KEY=YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE # comment
SECRET_HASH="something-with-a-#-hash"
Comments begin where a # exists, so if your value contains a # please wrap it in quotes. This is a breaking change from >= v15.0.0 and on.
Parsing
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Preload

Note: Consider using dotenvx instead of preloading. I am now doing (and recommending) so.
It serves the same purpose (you do not need to require and load dotenv), adds better debugging, and works with ANY language, framework, or platform. ‚Äì motdotla

You can use the --require (-r) command line option to preload dotenv. By doing this, you do not need to require and load dotenv in your application code.
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
The configuration options below are supported as command line arguments in the format dotenv_config_<option>=value
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env dotenv_config_debug=true
Additionally, you can use environment variables to set configuration options. Command line arguments will precede these.
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_<OPTION>=value node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_ENCODING=latin1 DOTENV_CONFIG_DEBUG=true node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env
Variable Expansion
You need to add the value of another variable in one of your variables? Use dotenv-expand.
Command Substitution
Use dotenvx to use command substitution.
Add the output of a command to one of your variables in your .env file.
# .env
DATABASE_URL="postgres://$(whoami)@localhost/my_database"
// index.js
console.log('DATABASE_URL', process.env.DATABASE_URL)
$ dotenvx run --debug -- node index.js
[dotenvx@0.14.1] injecting env (1) from .env
DATABASE_URL postgres://yourusername@localhost/my_database
Syncing
You need to keep .env files in sync between machines, environments, or team members? Use dotenvx to encrypt your .env files and safely include them in source control. This still subscribes to the twelve-factor app rules by generating a decryption key separate from code.
Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx to generate .env.ci, .env.production files, and more.
Deploying
You need to deploy your secrets in a cloud-agnostic manner? Use dotenvx to generate a private decryption key that is set on your production server.
üå¥ Manage Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx
Run any environment locally. Create a .env.ENVIRONMENT file and use --env-file to load it. It's straightforward, yet flexible.
$ echo "HELLO=production" > .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.production -- node index.js
Hello production
> ^^
or with multiple .env files
$ echo "HELLO=local" > .env.local
$ echo "HELLO=World" > .env
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.local --env-file=.env -- node index.js
Hello local
more environment examples
üöÄ Deploying
Use dotenvx.
Add encryption to your .env files with a single command. Pass the --encrypt flag.
$ dotenvx set HELLO Production --encrypt -f .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION="<.env.production private key>" dotenvx run -- node index.js
[dotenvx] injecting env (2) from .env.production
Hello Production

üìñ Documentation
Dotenv exposes four functions:

config
parse
populate
decrypt

Config
config will read your .env file, parse the contents, assign it to
process.env,
and return an Object with a parsed key containing the loaded content or an error key if it failed.
const result = dotenv.config()

if (result.error) {
  throw result.error
}

console.log(result.parsed)
You can additionally, pass options to config.
Options
path
Default: path.resolve(process.cwd(), '.env')
Specify a custom path if your file containing environment variables is located elsewhere.
require('dotenv').config({ path: '/custom/path/to/.env' })
By default, config will look for a file called .env in the current working directory.
Pass in multiple files as an array, and they will be parsed in order and combined with process.env (or option.processEnv, if set). The first value set for a variable will win, unless the options.override flag is set, in which case the last value set will win.  If a value already exists in process.env and the options.override flag is NOT set, no changes will be made to that value.
require('dotenv').config({ path: ['.env.local', '.env'] })
encoding
Default: utf8
Specify the encoding of your file containing environment variables.
require('dotenv').config({ encoding: 'latin1' })
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
require('dotenv').config({ debug: process.env.DEBUG })
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set on your machine with values from your .env file(s). If multiple files have been provided in option.path the override will also be used as each file is combined with the next. Without override being set, the first value wins. With override set the last value wins.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
processEnv
Default: process.env
Specify an object to write your environment variables to. Defaults to process.env environment variables.
const myObject = {}
require('dotenv').config({ processEnv: myObject })

console.log(myObject) // values from .env
console.log(process.env) // this was not changed or written to
Parse
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment
variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return
an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Options
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('hello world')
const opt = { debug: true }
const config = dotenv.parse(buf, opt)
// expect a debug message because the buffer is not in KEY=VAL form
Populate
The engine which populates the contents of your .env file to process.env is available for use. It accepts a target, a source, and options. This is useful for power users who want to supply their own objects.
For example, customizing the source:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'world' }

dotenv.populate(process.env, parsed)

console.log(process.env.HELLO) // world
For example, customizing the source AND target:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'universe' }
const target = { HELLO: 'world' } // empty object

dotenv.populate(target, parsed, { override: true, debug: true })

console.log(target) // { HELLO: 'universe' }
options
Debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being populated as you expect.
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set.

inner quotes are maintained (think JSON) (JSON={"foo": "bar"} becomes {JSON:"{\"foo\": \"bar\"}")
whitespace is removed from both ends of unquoted values (see more on trim) (FOO=  some value   becomes {FOO: 'some value'})
single and double quoted values are escaped (SINGLE_QUOTE='quoted' becomes {SINGLE_QUOTE: "quoted"})
single and double quoted values maintain whitespace from both ends (FOO="  some value  " becomes {FOO: '  some value  '})
double quoted values expand new lines (MULTILINE="new\nline" becomes

{MULTILINE: 'new
line'}


backticks are supported (BACKTICK_KEY=`This has 'single' and "double" quotes inside of it.`)

What happens to environment variables that were already set?
By default, we will never modify any environment variables that have already been set. In particular, if there is a variable in your .env file which collides with one that already exists in your environment, then that variable will be skipped.
If instead, you want to override process.env use the override option.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
How come my environment variables are not showing up for React?
Your React code is run in Webpack, where the fs module or even the process global itself are not accessible out-of-the-box. process.env can only be injected through Webpack configuration.
If you are using react-scripts, which is distributed through create-react-app, it has dotenv built in but with a quirk. Preface your environment variables with REACT_APP_. See this stack overflow for more details.
If you are using other frameworks (e.g. Next.js, Gatsby...), you need to consult their documentation for how to inject environment variables into the client.
Can I customize/write plugins for dotenv?
Yes! dotenv.config() returns an object representing the parsed .env file. This gives you everything you need to continue setting values on process.env. For example:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const variableExpansion = require('dotenv-expand')
const myEnv = dotenv.config()
variableExpansion(myEnv)
How do I use dotenv with import?
Simply..
// index.mjs (ESM)
import 'dotenv/config' // see https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#how-do-i-use-dotenv-with-import
import express from 'express'
A little background..

When you run a module containing an import declaration, the modules it imports are loaded first, then each module body is executed in a depth-first traversal of the dependency graph, avoiding cycles by skipping anything already executed.
‚Äì ES6 In Depth: Modules

What does this mean in plain language? It means you would think the following would work but it won't.
errorReporter.mjs:
class Client {
  constructor (apiKey) {
    console.log('apiKey', apiKey)

    this.apiKey = apiKey
  }
}

export default new Client(process.env.API_KEY)
index.mjs:
// Note: this is INCORRECT and will not work
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv'
dotenv.config()

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs' // process.env.API_KEY will be blank!
process.env.API_KEY will be blank.
Instead, index.mjs should be written as..
import 'dotenv/config'

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs'
Does that make sense? It's a bit unintuitive, but it is how importing of ES6 modules work. Here is a working example of this pitfall.
There are two alternatives to this approach:

Preload dotenv: node --require dotenv/config index.js (Note: you do not need to import dotenv with this approach)
Create a separate file that will execute config first as outlined in this comment on #133

Why am I getting the error Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'crypto|os|path'?
You are using dotenv on the front-end and have not included a polyfill. Webpack < 5 used to include these for you. Do the following:
npm install node-polyfill-webpack-plugin
Configure your webpack.config.js to something like the following.
require('dotenv').config()

const path = require('path');
const webpack = require('webpack')

const NodePolyfillPlugin = require('node-polyfill-webpack-plugin')

module.exports = {
  mode: 'development',
  entry: './src/index.ts',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  plugins: [
    new NodePolyfillPlugin(),
    new webpack.DefinePlugin({
      'process.env': {
        HELLO: JSON.stringify(process.env.HELLO)
      }
    }),
  ]
};
Alternatively, just use dotenv-webpack which does this and more behind the scenes for you.
What about variable expansion?
Try dotenv-expand
What about syncing and securing .env files?
Use dotenvx
What if I accidentally commit my .env file to code?
Remove it, remove git history and then install the git pre-commit hook to prevent this from ever happening again.
brew install dotenvx/brew/dotenvx
dotenvx precommit --install

How can I prevent committing my .env file to a Docker build?
Use the docker prebuild hook.
# Dockerfile
...
RUN curl -fsS https://dotenvx.sh/ | sh
...
RUN dotenvx prebuild
CMD ["dotenvx", "run", "--", "node", "index.js"]

dotenv 

Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology.

üå± Install
npm install dotenv --save
You can also use an npm-compatible package manager like yarn or bun:
yarn add dotenv
# or
bun add dotenv
üèóÔ∏è Usage






Create a .env file in the root of your project (if using a monorepo structure like apps/backend/app.js, put it in the root of the folder where your app.js process runs):
S3_BUCKET="YOURS3BUCKET"
SECRET_KEY="YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE"
As early as possible in your application, import and configure dotenv:
require('dotenv').config()
console.log(process.env) // remove this after you've confirmed it is working
.. or using ES6?
import 'dotenv/config'
That's it. process.env now has the keys and values you defined in your .env file:
require('dotenv').config()
// or import 'dotenv/config' if you're using ES6

...

s3.getBucketCors({Bucket: process.env.S3_BUCKET}, function(err, data) {})
Multiline values
If you need multiline variables, for example private keys, those are now supported (>= v15.0.0) with line breaks:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
...
Kh9NV...
...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
Alternatively, you can double quote strings and use the \n character:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nKh9NV...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
Comments
Comments may be added to your file on their own line or inline:
# This is a comment
SECRET_KEY=YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE # comment
SECRET_HASH="something-with-a-#-hash"
Comments begin where a # exists, so if your value contains a # please wrap it in quotes. This is a breaking change from >= v15.0.0 and on.
Parsing
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Preload

Note: Consider using dotenvx instead of preloading. I am now doing (and recommending) so.
It serves the same purpose (you do not need to require and load dotenv), adds better debugging, and works with ANY language, framework, or platform. ‚Äì motdotla

You can use the --require (-r) command line option to preload dotenv. By doing this, you do not need to require and load dotenv in your application code.
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
The configuration options below are supported as command line arguments in the format dotenv_config_<option>=value
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env dotenv_config_debug=true
Additionally, you can use environment variables to set configuration options. Command line arguments will precede these.
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_<OPTION>=value node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_ENCODING=latin1 DOTENV_CONFIG_DEBUG=true node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env
Variable Expansion
You need to add the value of another variable in one of your variables? Use dotenv-expand.
Command Substitution
Use dotenvx to use command substitution.
Add the output of a command to one of your variables in your .env file.
# .env
DATABASE_URL="postgres://$(whoami)@localhost/my_database"
// index.js
console.log('DATABASE_URL', process.env.DATABASE_URL)
$ dotenvx run --debug -- node index.js
[dotenvx@0.14.1] injecting env (1) from .env
DATABASE_URL postgres://yourusername@localhost/my_database
Syncing
You need to keep .env files in sync between machines, environments, or team members? Use dotenvx to encrypt your .env files and safely include them in source control. This still subscribes to the twelve-factor app rules by generating a decryption key separate from code.
Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx to generate .env.ci, .env.production files, and more.
Deploying
You need to deploy your secrets in a cloud-agnostic manner? Use dotenvx to generate a private decryption key that is set on your production server.
üå¥ Manage Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx
Run any environment locally. Create a .env.ENVIRONMENT file and use --env-file to load it. It's straightforward, yet flexible.
$ echo "HELLO=production" > .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.production -- node index.js
Hello production
> ^^
or with multiple .env files
$ echo "HELLO=local" > .env.local
$ echo "HELLO=World" > .env
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.local --env-file=.env -- node index.js
Hello local
more environment examples
üöÄ Deploying
Use dotenvx.
Add encryption to your .env files with a single command. Pass the --encrypt flag.
$ dotenvx set HELLO Production --encrypt -f .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION="<.env.production private key>" dotenvx run -- node index.js
[dotenvx] injecting env (2) from .env.production
Hello Production

üìñ Documentation
Dotenv exposes four functions:

config
parse
populate
decrypt

Config
config will read your .env file, parse the contents, assign it to
process.env,
and return an Object with a parsed key containing the loaded content or an error key if it failed.
const result = dotenv.config()

if (result.error) {
  throw result.error
}

console.log(result.parsed)
You can additionally, pass options to config.
Options
path
Default: path.resolve(process.cwd(), '.env')
Specify a custom path if your file containing environment variables is located elsewhere.
require('dotenv').config({ path: '/custom/path/to/.env' })
By default, config will look for a file called .env in the current working directory.
Pass in multiple files as an array, and they will be parsed in order and combined with process.env (or option.processEnv, if set). The first value set for a variable will win, unless the options.override flag is set, in which case the last value set will win.  If a value already exists in process.env and the options.override flag is NOT set, no changes will be made to that value.
require('dotenv').config({ path: ['.env.local', '.env'] })
encoding
Default: utf8
Specify the encoding of your file containing environment variables.
require('dotenv').config({ encoding: 'latin1' })
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
require('dotenv').config({ debug: process.env.DEBUG })
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set on your machine with values from your .env file(s). If multiple files have been provided in option.path the override will also be used as each file is combined with the next. Without override being set, the first value wins. With override set the last value wins.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
processEnv
Default: process.env
Specify an object to write your environment variables to. Defaults to process.env environment variables.
const myObject = {}
require('dotenv').config({ processEnv: myObject })

console.log(myObject) // values from .env
console.log(process.env) // this was not changed or written to
Parse
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment
variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return
an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Options
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('hello world')
const opt = { debug: true }
const config = dotenv.parse(buf, opt)
// expect a debug message because the buffer is not in KEY=VAL form
Populate
The engine which populates the contents of your .env file to process.env is available for use. It accepts a target, a source, and options. This is useful for power users who want to supply their own objects.
For example, customizing the source:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'world' }

dotenv.populate(process.env, parsed)

console.log(process.env.HELLO) // world
For example, customizing the source AND target:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'universe' }
const target = { HELLO: 'world' } // empty object

dotenv.populate(target, parsed, { override: true, debug: true })

console.log(target) // { HELLO: 'universe' }
options
Debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being populated as you expect.
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set.
‚ùì FAQ
Why is the .env file not loading my environment variables successfully?
Most likely your .env file is not in the correct place. See this stack overflow.
Turn on debug mode and try again..
require('dotenv').config({ debug: true })
You will receive a helpful error outputted to your console.
Should I commit my .env file?
No. We strongly recommend against committing your .env file to version
control. It should only include environment-specific values such as database
passwords or API keys. Your production database should have a different
password than your development database.
Should I have multiple .env files?
We recommend creating one .env file per environment. Use .env for local/development, .env.production for production and so on. This still follows the twelve factor principles as each is attributed individually to its own environment. Avoid custom set ups that work in inheritance somehow (.env.production inherits values form .env for example). It is better to duplicate values if necessary across each .env.environment file.

In a twelve-factor app, env vars are granular controls, each fully orthogonal to other env vars. They are never grouped together as ‚Äúenvironments‚Äù, but instead are independently managed for each deploy. This is a model that scales up smoothly as the app naturally expands into more deploys over its lifetime.
‚Äì The Twelve-Factor App

What rules does the parsing engine follow?
The parsing engine currently supports the following rules:

BASIC=basic becomes {BASIC: 'basic'}
empty lines are skipped
lines beginning with # are treated as comments
# marks the beginning of a comment (unless when the value is wrapped in quotes)
empty values become empty strings (EMPTY= becomes {EMPTY: ''})
inner quotes are maintained (think JSON) (JSON={"foo": "bar"} becomes {JSON:"{\"foo\": \"bar\"}")
whitespace is removed from both ends of unquoted values (see more on trim) (FOO=  some value   becomes {FOO: 'some value'})
single and double quoted values are escaped (SINGLE_QUOTE='quoted' becomes {SINGLE_QUOTE: "quoted"})
single and double quoted values maintain whitespace from both ends (FOO="  some value  " becomes {FOO: '  some value  '})
double quoted values expand new lines (MULTILINE="new\nline" becomes

{MULTILINE: 'new
line'}


backticks are supported (BACKTICK_KEY=`This has 'single' and "double" quotes inside of it.`)

What happens to environment variables that were already set?
By default, we will never modify any environment variables that have already been set. In particular, if there is a variable in your .env file which collides with one that already exists in your environment, then that variable will be skipped.
If instead, you want to override process.env use the override option.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
How come my environment variables are not showing up for React?
Your React code is run in Webpack, where the fs module or even the process global itself are not accessible out-of-the-box. process.env can only be injected through Webpack configuration.
If you are using react-scripts, which is distributed through create-react-app, it has dotenv built in but with a quirk. Preface your environment variables with REACT_APP_. See this stack overflow for more details.
If you are using other frameworks (e.g. Next.js, Gatsby...), you need to consult their documentation for how to inject environment variables into the client.
Can I customize/write plugins for dotenv?
Yes! dotenv.config() returns an object representing the parsed .env file. This gives you everything you need to continue setting values on process.env. For example:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const variableExpansion = require('dotenv-expand')
const myEnv = dotenv.config()
variableExpansion(myEnv)
How do I use dotenv with import?
Simply..
// index.mjs (ESM)
import 'dotenv/config' // see https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#how-do-i-use-dotenv-with-import
import express from 'express'
A little background..

When you run a module containing an import declaration, the modules it imports are loaded first, then each module body is executed in a depth-first traversal of the dependency graph, avoiding cycles by skipping anything already executed.
‚Äì ES6 In Depth: Modules

What does this mean in plain language? It means you would think the following would work but it won't.
errorReporter.mjs:
class Client {
  constructor (apiKey) {
    console.log('apiKey', apiKey)

export default new Client(process.env.API_KEY)
index.mjs:
// Note: this is INCORRECT and will not work
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv'
dotenv.config()

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs' // process.env.API_KEY will be blank!
process.env.API_KEY will be blank.
Instead, index.mjs should be written as..
import 'dotenv/config'

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs'
Does that make sense? It's a bit unintuitive, but it is how importing of ES6 modules work. Here is a working example of this pitfall.
There are two alternatives to this approach:

Preload dotenv: node --require dotenv/config index.js (Note: you do not need to import dotenv with this approach)
Create a separate file that will execute config first as outlined in this comment on #133

Why am I getting the error Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'crypto|os|path'?
You are using dotenv on the front-end and have not included a polyfill. Webpack < 5 used to include these for you. Do the following:
npm install node-polyfill-webpack-plugin
Configure your webpack.config.js to something like the following.
require('dotenv').config()

const path = require('path');
const webpack = require('webpack')

const NodePolyfillPlugin = require('node-polyfill-webpack-plugin')

module.exports = {
  mode: 'development',
  entry: './src/index.ts',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  plugins: [
    new NodePolyfillPlugin(),
    new webpack.DefinePlugin({
      'process.env': {
        HELLO: JSON.stringify(process.env.HELLO)
      }
    }),
  ]
};
Alternatively, just use dotenv-webpack which does this and more behind the scenes for you.

Try dotenv-expand
What about syncing and securing .env files?
Use dotenvx
What if I accidentally commit my .env file to code?
Remove it, remove git history and then install the git pre-commit hook to prevent this from ever happening again.

dotenv 

Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology.

üå± Install
npm install dotenv --save
You can also use an npm-compatible package manager like yarn or bun:
yarn add dotenv
# or
bun add dotenv
üèóÔ∏è Usage






Create a .env file in the root of your project (if using a monorepo structure like apps/backend/app.js, put it in the root of the folder where your app.js process runs):
S3_BUCKET="YOURS3BUCKET"
SECRET_KEY="YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE"
As early as possible in your application, import and configure dotenv:
require('dotenv').config()
console.log(process.env) // remove this after you've confirmed it is working
.. or using ES6?
import 'dotenv/config'
That's it. process.env now has the keys and values you defined in your .env file:
require('dotenv').config()
// or import 'dotenv/config' if you're using ES6

...

s3.getBucketCors({Bucket: process.env.S3_BUCKET}, function(err, data) {})
Multiline values
If you need multiline variables, for example private keys, those are now supported (>= v15.0.0) with line breaks:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
...
Kh9NV...
...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
Alternatively, you can double quote strings and use the \n character:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nKh9NV...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
Comments
Comments may be added to your file on their own line or inline:
# This is a comment
SECRET_KEY=YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE # comment
SECRET_HASH="something-with-a-#-hash"
Comments begin where a # exists, so if your value contains a # please wrap it in quotes. This is a breaking change from >= v15.0.0 and on.
Parsing
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Preload

Note: Consider using dotenvx instead of preloading. I am now doing (and recommending) so.
It serves the same purpose (you do not need to require and load dotenv), adds better debugging, and works with ANY language, framework, or platform. ‚Äì motdotla

You can use the --require (-r) command line option to preload dotenv. By doing this, you do not need to require and load dotenv in your application code.
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
The configuration options below are supported as command line arguments in the format dotenv_config_<option>=value
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env dotenv_config_debug=true
Additionally, you can use environment variables to set configuration options. Command line arguments will precede these.
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_<OPTION>=value node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_ENCODING=latin1 DOTENV_CONFIG_DEBUG=true node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env
Variable Expansion
You need to add the value of another variable in one of your variables? Use dotenv-expand.
Command Substitution
Use dotenvx to use command substitution.
Add the output of a command to one of your variables in your .env file.
# .env
DATABASE_URL="postgres://$(whoami)@localhost/my_database"
// index.js
console.log('DATABASE_URL', process.env.DATABASE_URL)
$ dotenvx run --debug -- node index.js
[dotenvx@0.14.1] injecting env (1) from .env
DATABASE_URL postgres://yourusername@localhost/my_database
Syncing
You need to keep .env files in sync between machines, environments, or team members? Use dotenvx to encrypt your .env files and safely include them in source control. This still subscribes to the twelve-factor app rules by generating a decryption key separate from code.
Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx to generate .env.ci, .env.production files, and more.
Deploying
You need to deploy your secrets in a cloud-agnostic manner? Use dotenvx to generate a private decryption key that is set on your production server.
üå¥ Manage Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx
Run any environment locally. Create a .env.ENVIRONMENT file and use --env-file to load it. It's straightforward, yet flexible.
$ echo "HELLO=production" > .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.production -- node index.js
Hello production
> ^^
or with multiple .env files
$ echo "HELLO=local" > .env.local
$ echo "HELLO=World" > .env
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.local --env-file=.env -- node index.js
Hello local
more environment examples
üöÄ Deploying
Use dotenvx.
Add encryption to your .env files with a single command. Pass the --encrypt flag.
$ dotenvx set HELLO Production --encrypt -f .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION="<.env.production private key>" dotenvx run -- node index.js
[dotenvx] injecting env (2) from .env.production
Hello Production

üìñ Documentation
Dotenv exposes four functions:

config
parse
populate
decrypt

Config
config will read your .env file, parse the contents, assign it to
process.env,
and return an Object with a parsed key containing the loaded content or an error key if it failed.
const result = dotenv.config()

if (result.error) {
  throw result.error
}

console.log(result.parsed)
You can additionally, pass options to config.
Options
path
Default: path.resolve(process.cwd(), '.env')
Specify a custom path if your file containing environment variables is located elsewhere.
require('dotenv').config({ path: '/custom/path/to/.env' })
By default, config will look for a file called .env in the current working directory.
Pass in multiple files as an array, and they will be parsed in order and combined with process.env (or option.processEnv, if set). The first value set for a variable will win, unless the options.override flag is set, in which case the last value set will win.  If a value already exists in process.env and the options.override flag is NOT set, no changes will be made to that value.
require('dotenv').config({ path: ['.env.local', '.env'] })
encoding
Default: utf8
Specify the encoding of your file containing environment variables.
require('dotenv').config({ encoding: 'latin1' })
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
require('dotenv').config({ debug: process.env.DEBUG })
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set on your machine with values from your .env file(s). If multiple files have been provided in option.path the override will also be used as each file is combined with the next. Without override being set, the first value wins. With override set the last value wins.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
processEnv
Default: process.env
Specify an object to write your environment variables to. Defaults to process.env environment variables.
const myObject = {}
require('dotenv').config({ processEnv: myObject })

console.log(myObject) // values from .env
console.log(process.env) // this was not changed or written to
Parse
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment
variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return
an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Options
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('hello world')
const opt = { debug: true }
const config = dotenv.parse(buf, opt)
// expect a debug message because the buffer is not in KEY=VAL form
Populate
The engine which populates the contents of your .env file to process.env is available for use. It accepts a target, a source, and options. This is useful for power users who want to supply their own objects.
For example, customizing the source:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'world' }

dotenv.populate(process.env, parsed)

console.log(process.env.HELLO) // world
For example, customizing the source AND target:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'universe' }
const target = { HELLO: 'world' } // empty object

dotenv.populate(target, parsed, { override: true, debug: true })

console.log(target) // { HELLO: 'universe' }
options
Debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being populated as you expect.
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set.
‚ùì FAQ
Why is the .env file not loading my environment variables successfully?
Most likely your .env file is not in the correct place. See this stack overflow.
Turn on debug mode and try again..
require('dotenv').config({ debug: true })
You will receive a helpful error outputted to your console.
Should I commit my .env file?
No. We strongly recommend against committing your .env file to version
control. It should only include environment-specific values such as database
passwords or API keys. Your production database should have a different
password than your development database.
Should I have multiple .env files?
We recommend creating one .env file per environment. Use .env for local/development, .env.production for production and so on. This still follows the twelve factor principles as each is attributed individually to its own environment. Avoid custom set ups that work in inheritance somehow (.env.production inherits values form .env for example). It is better to duplicate values if necessary across each .env.environment file.

In a twelve-factor app, env vars are granular controls, each fully orthogonal to other env vars. They are never grouped together as ‚Äúenvironments‚Äù, but instead are independently managed for each deploy. This is a model that scales up smoothly as the app naturally expands into more deploys over its lifetime.
‚Äì The Twelve-Factor App

What rules does the parsing engine follow?
The parsing engine currently supports the following rules:

BASIC=basic becomes {BASIC: 'basic'}
empty lines are skipped
lines beginning with # are treated as comments
# marks the beginning of a comment (unless when the value is wrapped in quotes)
empty values become empty strings (EMPTY= becomes {EMPTY: ''})
inner quotes are maintained (think JSON) (JSON={"foo": "bar"} becomes {JSON:"{\"foo\": \"bar\"}")
whitespace is removed from both ends of unquoted values (see more on trim) (FOO=  some value   becomes {FOO: 'some value'})
single and double quoted values are escaped (SINGLE_QUOTE='quoted' becomes {SINGLE_QUOTE: "quoted"})
single and double quoted values maintain whitespace from both ends (FOO="  some value  " becomes {FOO: '  some value  '})
double quoted values expand new lines (MULTILINE="new\nline" becomes

{MULTILINE: 'new
line'}


backticks are supported (BACKTICK_KEY=`This has 'single' and "double" quotes inside of it.`)

What happens to environment variables that were already set?
By default, we will never modify any environment variables that have already been set. In particular, if there is a variable in your .env file which collides with one that already exists in your environment, then that variable will be skipped.
If instead, you want to override process.env use the override option.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
How come my environment variables are not showing up for React?
Your React code is run in Webpack, where the fs module or even the process global itself are not accessible out-of-the-box. process.env can only be injected through Webpack configuration.
If you are using react-scripts, which is distributed through create-react-app, it has dotenv built in but with a quirk. Preface your environment variables with REACT_APP_. See this stack overflow for more details.
If you are using other frameworks (e.g. Next.js, Gatsby...), you need to consult their documentation for how to inject environment variables into the client.
Can I customize/write plugins for dotenv?
Yes! dotenv.config() returns an object representing the parsed .env file. This gives you everything you need to continue setting values on process.env. For example:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const variableExpansion = require('dotenv-expand')
const myEnv = dotenv.config()
variableExpansion(myEnv)
How do I use dotenv with import?
Simply..
// index.mjs (ESM)
import 'dotenv/config' // see https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#how-do-i-use-dotenv-with-import
import express from 'express'
A little background..

When you run a module containing an import declaration, the modules it imports are loaded first, then each module body is executed in a depth-first traversal of the dependency graph, avoiding cycles by skipping anything already executed.
‚Äì ES6 In Depth: Modules

What does this mean in plain language? It means you would think the following would work but it won't.
errorReporter.mjs:
class Client {
  constructor (apiKey) {
    console.log('apiKey', apiKey)

    this.apiKey = apiKey
  }
}

export default new Client(process.env.API_KEY)
index.mjs:
// Note: this is INCORRECT and will not work
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv'
dotenv.config()

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs' // process.env.API_KEY will be blank!
process.env.API_KEY will be blank.
Instead, index.mjs should be written as..
import 'dotenv/config'

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs'
Does that make sense? It's a bit unintuitive, but it is how importing of ES6 modules work. Here is a working example of this pitfall.
There are two alternatives to this approach:

Preload dotenv: node --require dotenv/config index.js (Note: you do not need to import dotenv with this approach)
Create a separate file that will execute config first as outlined in this comment on #133

Why am I getting the error Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'crypto|os|path'?
You are using dotenv on the front-end and have not included a polyfill. Webpack < 5 used to include these for you. Do the following:
npm install node-polyfill-webpack-plugin
Configure your webpack.config.js to something like the following.
require('dotenv').config()

const path = require('path');
const webpack = require('webpack')

const NodePolyfillPlugin = require('node-polyfill-webpack-plugin')

module.exports = {
  mode: 'development',
  entry: './src/index.ts',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  plugins: [
    new NodePolyfillPlugin(),
    new webpack.DefinePlugin({
      'process.env': {
        HELLO: JSON.stringify(process.env.HELLO)
      }
    }),
  ]
};
Alternatively, just use dotenv-webpack which does this and more behind the scenes for you.
What about variable expansion?
Try dotenv-expand
What about syncing and securing .env files?
Use dotenvx
What if I accidentally commit my .env file to code?
Remove it, remove git history and then install the git pre-commit hook to prevent this from ever happening again.
brew install dotenvx/brew/dotenvx
dotenvx precommit --install

How can I prevent committing my .env file to a Docker build?
Use the docker prebuild hook.
# Dockerfile

dotenv 

Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology.

üå± Install
npm install dotenv --save
You can also use an npm-compatible package manager like yarn or bun:
yarn add dotenv
# or
bun add dotenv
üèóÔ∏è Usage






Create a .env file in the root of your project (if using a monorepo structure like apps/backend/app.js, put it in the root of the folder where your app.js process runs):
S3_BUCKET="YOURS3BUCKET"
SECRET_KEY="YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE"
As early as possible in your application, import and configure dotenv:
require('dotenv').config()
console.log(process.env) // remove this after you've confirmed it is working
.. or using ES6?
import 'dotenv/config'
That's it. process.env now has the keys and values you defined in your .env file:
require('dotenv').config()
// or import 'dotenv/config' if you're using ES6

...

s3.getBucketCors({Bucket: process.env.S3_BUCKET}, function(err, data) {})
Multiline values
If you need multiline variables, for example private keys, those are now supported (>= v15.0.0) with line breaks:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
...
Kh9NV...
...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
Alternatively, you can double quote strings and use the \n character:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nKh9NV...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
Comments
Comments may be added to your file on their own line or inline:
# This is a comment
SECRET_KEY=YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE # comment
SECRET_HASH="something-with-a-#-hash"
Comments begin where a # exists, so if your value contains a # please wrap it in quotes. This is a breaking change from >= v15.0.0 and on.
Parsing
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Preload

Note: Consider using dotenvx instead of preloading. I am now doing (and recommending) so.
It serves the same purpose (you do not need to require and load dotenv), adds better debugging, and works with ANY language, framework, or platform. ‚Äì motdotla

You can use the --require (-r) command line option to preload dotenv. By doing this, you do not need to require and load dotenv in your application code.
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
The configuration options below are supported as command line arguments in the format dotenv_config_<option>=value
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env dotenv_config_debug=true
Additionally, you can use environment variables to set configuration options. Command line arguments will precede these.
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_<OPTION>=value node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_ENCODING=latin1 DOTENV_CONFIG_DEBUG=true node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env
Variable Expansion
You need to add the value of another variable in one of your variables? Use dotenv-expand.
Command Substitution
Use dotenvx to use command substitution.
Add the output of a command to one of your variables in your .env file.
# .env
DATABASE_URL="postgres://$(whoami)@localhost/my_database"
// index.js
console.log('DATABASE_URL', process.env.DATABASE_URL)
$ dotenvx run --debug -- node index.js
[dotenvx@0.14.1] injecting env (1) from .env
DATABASE_URL postgres://yourusername@localhost/my_database
Syncing
You need to keep .env files in sync between machines, environments, or team members? Use dotenvx to encrypt your .env files and safely include them in source control. This still subscribes to the twelve-factor app rules by generating a decryption key separate from code.
Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx to generate .env.ci, .env.production files, and more.
Deploying
You need to deploy your secrets in a cloud-agnostic manner? Use dotenvx to generate a private decryption key that is set on your production server.
üå¥ Manage Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx
Run any environment locally. Create a .env.ENVIRONMENT file and use --env-file to load it. It's straightforward, yet flexible.
$ echo "HELLO=production" > .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.production -- node index.js
Hello production
> ^^
or with multiple .env files
$ echo "HELLO=local" > .env.local
$ echo "HELLO=World" > .env
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.local --env-file=.env -- node index.js
Hello local
more environment examples
üöÄ Deploying
Use dotenvx.
Add encryption to your .env files with a single command. Pass the --encrypt flag.
$ dotenvx set HELLO Production --encrypt -f .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION="<.env.production private key>" dotenvx run -- node index.js
[dotenvx] injecting env (2) from .env.production
Hello Production

üìñ Documentation
Dotenv exposes four functions:

config
parse
populate
decrypt

Config
config will read your .env file, parse the contents, assign it to
process.env,
and return an Object with a parsed key containing the loaded content or an error key if it failed.
const result = dotenv.config()

if (result.error) {
  throw result.error
}

console.log(result.parsed)
You can additionally, pass options to config.
Options
path
Default: path.resolve(process.cwd(), '.env')
Specify a custom path if your file containing environment variables is located elsewhere.
require('dotenv').config({ path: '/custom/path/to/.env' })
By default, config will look for a file called .env in the current working directory.
Pass in multiple files as an array, and they will be parsed in order and combined with process.env (or option.processEnv, if set). The first value set for a variable will win, unless the options.override flag is set, in which case the last value set will win.  If a value already exists in process.env and the options.override flag is NOT set, no changes will be made to that value.
require('dotenv').config({ path: ['.env.local', '.env'] })
encoding
Default: utf8
Specify the encoding of your file containing environment variables.
require('dotenv').config({ encoding: 'latin1' })
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
require('dotenv').config({ debug: process.env.DEBUG })
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set on your machine with values from your .env file(s). If multiple files have been provided in option.path the override will also be used as each file is combined with the next. Without override being set, the first value wins. With override set the last value wins.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
processEnv
Default: process.env
Specify an object to write your environment variables to. Defaults to process.env environment variables.
const myObject = {}
require('dotenv').config({ processEnv: myObject })

console.log(myObject) // values from .env
console.log(process.env) // this was not changed or written to
Parse
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment
variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return
an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Options
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('hello world')
const opt = { debug: true }
const config = dotenv.parse(buf, opt)
// expect a debug message because the buffer is not in KEY=VAL form
Populate
The engine which populates the contents of your .env file to process.env is available for use. It accepts a target, a source, and options. This is useful for power users who want to supply their own objects.
For example, customizing the source:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'world' }

dotenv.populate(process.env, parsed)

console.log(process.env.HELLO) // world
For example, customizing the source AND target:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'universe' }
const target = { HELLO: 'world' } // empty object

dotenv.populate(target, parsed, { override: true, debug: true })

console.log(target) // { HELLO: 'universe' }
options
Debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being populated as you expect.
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set.
‚ùì FAQ
Why is the .env file not loading my environment variables successfully?
Most likely your .env file is not in the correct place. See this stack overflow.
Turn on debug mode and try again..
require('dotenv').config({ debug: true })
You will receive a helpful error outputted to your console.
Should I commit my .env file?
No. We strongly recommend against committing your .env file to version
control. It should only include environment-specific values such as database
passwords or API keys. Your production database should have a different
password than your development database.
Should I have multiple .env files?
We recommend creating one .env file per environment. Use .env for local/development, .env.production for production and so on. This still follows the twelve factor principles as each is attributed individually to its own environment. Avoid custom set ups that work in inheritance somehow (.env.production inherits values form .env for example). It is better to duplicate values if necessary across each .env.environment file.

In a twelve-factor app, env vars are granular controls, each fully orthogonal to other env vars. They are never grouped together as ‚Äúenvironments‚Äù, but instead are independently managed for each deploy. This is a model that scales up smoothly as the app naturally expands into more deploys over its lifetime.
‚Äì The Twelve-Factor App

What rules does the parsing engine follow?
The parsing engine currently supports the following rules:

BASIC=basic becomes {BASIC: 'basic'}
empty lines are skipped
lines beginning with # are treated as comments
# marks the beginning of a comment (unless when the value is wrapped in quotes)
empty values become empty strings (EMPTY= becomes {EMPTY: ''})
inner quotes are maintained (think JSON) (JSON={"foo": "bar"} becomes {JSON:"{\"foo\": \"bar\"}")
whitespace is removed from both ends of unquoted values (see more on trim) (FOO=  some value   becomes {FOO: 'some value'})
single and double quoted values are escaped (SINGLE_QUOTE='quoted' becomes {SINGLE_QUOTE: "quoted"})
single and double quoted values maintain whitespace from both ends (FOO="  some value  " becomes {FOO: '  some value  '})
double quoted values expand new lines (MULTILINE="new\nline" becomes

{MULTILINE: 'new
line'}


backticks are supported (BACKTICK_KEY=`This has 'single' and "double" quotes inside of it.`)

What happens to environment variables that were already set?
By default, we will never modify any environment variables that have already been set. In particular, if there is a variable in your .env file which collides with one that already exists in your environment, then that variable will be skipped.
If instead, you want to override process.env use the override option.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
How come my environment variables are not showing up for React?
Your React code is run in Webpack, where the fs module or even the process global itself are not accessible out-of-the-box. process.env can only be injected through Webpack configuration.
If you are using react-scripts, which is distributed through create-react-app, it has dotenv built in but with a quirk. Preface your environment variables with REACT_APP_. See this stack overflow for more details.
If you are using other frameworks (e.g. Next.js, Gatsby...), you need to consult their documentation for how to inject environment variables into the client.
Can I customize/write plugins for dotenv?
Yes! dotenv.config() returns an object representing the parsed .env file. This gives you everything you need to continue setting values on process.env. For example:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const variableExpansion = require('dotenv-expand')
const myEnv = dotenv.config()
variableExpansion(myEnv)
How do I use dotenv with import?
Simply..
// index.mjs (ESM)
import 'dotenv/config' // see https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#how-do-i-use-dotenv-with-import
import express from 'express'
A little background..

When you run a module containing an import declaration, the modules it imports are loaded first, then each module body is executed in a depth-first traversal of the dependency graph, avoiding cycles by skipping anything already executed.
‚Äì ES6 In Depth: Modules

What does this mean in plain language? It means you would think the following would work but it won't.
errorReporter.mjs:
class Client {
  constructor (apiKey) {
    console.log('apiKey', apiKey)

    this.apiKey = apiKey
  }
}

export default new Client(process.env.API_KEY)
index.mjs:
// Note: this is INCORRECT and will not work
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv'
dotenv.config()

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs' // process.env.API_KEY will be blank!
process.env.API_KEY will be blank.
Instead, index.mjs should be written as..
import 'dotenv/config'

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs'
Does that make sense? It's a bit unintuitive, but it is how importing of ES6 modules work. Here is a working example of this pitfall.
There are two alternatives to this approach:

Preload dotenv: node --require dotenv/config index.js (Note: you do not need to import dotenv with this approach)
Create a separate file that will execute config first as outlined in this comment on #133

Why am I getting the error Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'crypto|os|path'?
You are using dotenv on the front-end and have not included a polyfill. Webpack < 5 used to include these for you. Do the following:
npm install node-polyfill-webpack-plugin
Configure your webpack.config.js to something like the following.
require('dotenv').config()

const path = require('path');
const webpack = require('webpack')

const NodePolyfillPlugin = require('node-polyfill-webpack-plugin')

module.exports = {
  mode: 'development',
  entry: './src/index.ts',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  plugins: [
    new NodePolyfillPlugin(),
    new webpack.DefinePlugin({
      'process.env': {
        HELLO: JSON.stringify(process.env.HELLO)
      }
    }),
  ]
};
Alternatively, just use dotenv-webpack which does this and more behind the scenes for you.
What about variable expansion?
Try dotenv-expand
What about syncing and securing .env files?
Use dotenvx
What if I accidentally commit my .env file to code?
Remove it, remove git history and then install the git pre-commit hook to prevent this from ever happening again.
brew install dotenvx/brew/dotenvx
dotenvx precommit --install

How can I prevent committing my .env file to a Docker build?
Use the docker prebuild hook.
# Dockerfile
...
RUN curl -fsS https://dotenvx.sh/ | sh
...
RUN dotenvx prebuild
CMD ["dotenvx", "run", "--", "node", "index.js"]

Who's using dotenv?
These npm modules depend on it.
Projects that expand it often use the keyword "dotenv" on npm.

Create a .env file in the root of your project (if using a monorepo structure like apps/backend/app.js, put it in the root of the folder where your app.js process runs):
S3_BUCKET="YOURS3BUCKET"
SECRET_KEY="YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE"
As early as possible in your application, import and configure dotenv:
require('dotenv').config()
console.log(process.env) // remove this after you've confirmed it is working
.. or using ES6?
import 'dotenv/config'
That's it. process.env now has the keys and values you defined in your .env file:
require('dotenv').config()
// or import 'dotenv/config' if you're using ES6

...

s3.getBucketCors({Bucket: process.env.S3_BUCKET}, function(err, data) {})
Multiline values
If you need multiline variables, for example private keys, those are now supported (>= v15.0.0) with line breaks:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
...
Kh9NV...
...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
Alternatively, you can double quote strings and use the \n character:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nKh9NV...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
Comments
Comments may be added to your file on their own line or inline:
# This is a comment
SECRET_KEY=YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE # comment
SECRET_HASH="something-with-a-#-hash"
Comments begin where a # exists, so if your value contains a # please wrap it in quotes. This is a breaking change from >= v15.0.0 and on.
Parsing
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Preload

Note: Consider using dotenvx instead of preloading. I am now doing (and recommending) so.
It serves the same purpose (you do not need to require and load dotenv), adds better debugging, and works with ANY language, framework, or platform. ‚Äì motdotla

You can use the --require (-r) command line option to preload dotenv. By doing this, you do not need to require and load dotenv in your application code.
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
The configuration options below are supported as command line arguments in the format dotenv_config_<option>=value
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env dotenv_config_debug=true
Additionally, you can use environment variables to set configuration options. Command line arguments will precede these.
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_<OPTION>=value node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_ENCODING=latin1 DOTENV_CONFIG_DEBUG=true node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env
Variable Expansion
You need to add the value of another variable in one of your variables? Use dotenv-expand.
Command Substitution
Use dotenvx to use command substitution.
Add the output of a command to one of your variables in your .env file.
# .env
DATABASE_URL="postgres://$(whoami)@localhost/my_database"
// index.js
console.log('DATABASE_URL', process.env.DATABASE_URL)
$ dotenvx run --debug -- node index.js
[dotenvx@0.14.1] injecting env (1) from .env
DATABASE_URL postgres://yourusername@localhost/my_database
Syncing
You need to keep .env files in sync between machines, environments, or team members? Use dotenvx to encrypt your .env files and safely include them in source control. This still subscribes to the twelve-factor app rules by generating a decryption key separate from code.
Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx to generate .env.ci, .env.production files, and more.
Deploying
You need to deploy your secrets in a cloud-agnostic manner? Use dotenvx to generate a private decryption key that is set on your production server.
üå¥ Manage Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx
Run any environment locally. Create a .env.ENVIRONMENT file and use --env-file to load it. It's straightforward, yet flexible.
$ echo "HELLO=production" > .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.production -- node index.js
Hello production
> ^^
or with multiple .env files
$ echo "HELLO=local" > .env.local
$ echo "HELLO=World" > .env
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.local --env-file=.env -- node index.js
Hello local
more environment examples
üöÄ Deploying
Use dotenvx.
Add encryption to your .env files with a single command. Pass the --encrypt flag.
$ dotenvx set HELLO Production --encrypt -f .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION="<.env.production private key>" dotenvx run -- node index.js
[dotenvx] injecting env (2) from .env.production
Hello Production

üìñ Documentation
Dotenv exposes four functions:

config
parse
populate
decrypt

Config
config will read your .env file, parse the contents, assign it to
process.env,
and return an Object with a parsed key containing the loaded content or an error key if it failed.
const result = dotenv.config()

if (result.error) {
  throw result.error
}

console.log(result.parsed)
You can additionally, pass options to config.
Options
path
Default: path.resolve(process.cwd(), '.env')
Specify a custom path if your file containing environment variables is located elsewhere.
require('dotenv').config({ path: '/custom/path/to/.env' })
By default, config will look for a file called .env in the current working directory.
Pass in multiple files as an array, and they will be parsed in order and combined with process.env (or option.processEnv, if set). The first value set for a variable will win, unless the options.override flag is set, in which case the last value set will win.  If a value already exists in process.env and the options.override flag is NOT set, no changes will be made to that value.
require('dotenv').config({ path: ['.env.local', '.env'] })
encoding
Default: utf8
Specify the encoding of your file containing environment variables.
require('dotenv').config({ encoding: 'latin1' })
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
require('dotenv').config({ debug: process.env.DEBUG })
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set on your machine with values from your .env file(s). If multiple files have been provided in option.path the override will also be used as each file is combined with the next. Without override being set, the first value wins. With override set the last value wins.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
processEnv
Default: process.env
Specify an object to write your environment variables to. Defaults to process.env environment variables.
const myObject = {}
require('dotenv').config({ processEnv: myObject })

console.log(myObject) // values from .env
console.log(process.env) // this was not changed or written to
Parse
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment
variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return
an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Options
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('hello world')
const opt = { debug: true }
const config = dotenv.parse(buf, opt)
// expect a debug message because the buffer is not in KEY=VAL form
Populate
The engine which populates the contents of your .env file to process.env is available for use. It accepts a target, a source, and options. This is useful for power users who want to supply their own objects.
For example, customizing the source:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'world' }

dotenv.populate(process.env, parsed)

console.log(process.env.HELLO) // world
For example, customizing the source AND target:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'universe' }
const target = { HELLO: 'world' } // empty object

dotenv.populate(target, parsed, { override: true, debug: true })

console.log(target) // { HELLO: 'universe' }
options
Debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being populated as you expect.
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set.
‚ùì FAQ
Why is the .env file not loading my environment variables successfully?
Most likely your .env file is not in the correct place. See this stack overflow.
Turn on debug mode and try again..
require('dotenv').config({ debug: true })
You will receive a helpful error outputted to your console.
Should I commit my .env file?
No. We strongly recommend against committing your .env file to version
control. It should only include environment-specific values such as database
passwords or API keys. Your production database should have a different
password than your development database.
Should I have multiple .env files?
We recommend creating one .env file per environment. Use .env for local/development, .env.production for production and so on. This still follows the twelve factor principles as each is attributed individually to its own environment. Avoid custom set ups that work in inheritance somehow (.env.production inherits values form .env for example). It is better to duplicate values if necessary across each .env.environment file.

In a twelve-factor app, env vars are granular controls, each fully orthogonal to other env vars. They are never grouped together as ‚Äúenvironments‚Äù, but instead are independently managed for each deploy. This is a model that scales up smoothly as the app naturally expands into more deploys over its lifetime.
‚Äì The Twelve-Factor App

What rules does the parsing engine follow?
The parsing engine currently supports the following rules:

BASIC=basic becomes {BASIC: 'basic'}
empty lines are skipped
lines beginning with # are treated as comments
# marks the beginning of a comment (unless when the value is wrapped in quotes)
empty values become empty strings (EMPTY= becomes {EMPTY: ''})
inner quotes are maintained (think JSON) (JSON={"foo": "bar"} becomes {JSON:"{\"foo\": \"bar\"}")
whitespace is removed from both ends of unquoted values (see more on trim) (FOO=  some value   becomes {FOO: 'some value'})
single and double quoted values are escaped (SINGLE_QUOTE='quoted' becomes {SINGLE_QUOTE: "quoted"})
single and double quoted values maintain whitespace from both ends (FOO="  some value  " becomes {FOO: '  some value  '})
double quoted values expand new lines (MULTILINE="new\nline" becomes

{MULTILINE: 'new
line'}


backticks are supported (BACKTICK_KEY=`This has 'single' and "double" quotes inside of it.`)

What happens to environment variables that were already set?
By default, we will never modify any environment variables that have already been set. In particular, if there is a variable in your .env file which collides with one that already exists in your environment, then that variable will be skipped.
If instead, you want to override process.env use the override option.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
How come my environment variables are not showing up for React?
Your React code is run in Webpack, where the fs module or even the process global itself are not accessible out-of-the-box. process.env can only be injected through Webpack configuration.
If you are using react-scripts, which is distributed through create-react-app, it has dotenv built in but with a quirk. Preface your environment variables with REACT_APP_. See this stack overflow for more details.
If you are using other frameworks (e.g. Next.js, Gatsby...), you need to consult their documentation for how to inject environment variables into the client.
Can I customize/write plugins for dotenv?
Yes! dotenv.config() returns an object representing the parsed .env file. This gives you everything you need to continue setting values on process.env. For example:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const variableExpansion = require('dotenv-expand')
const myEnv = dotenv.config()
variableExpansion(myEnv)
How do I use dotenv with import?
Simply..
// index.mjs (ESM)
import 'dotenv/config' // see https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#how-do-i-use-dotenv-with-import
import express from 'express'
A little background..

When you run a module containing an import declaration, the modules it imports are loaded first, then each module body is executed in a depth-first traversal of the dependency graph, avoiding cycles by skipping anything already executed.
‚Äì ES6 In Depth: Modules

What does this mean in plain language? It means you would think the following would work but it won't.
errorReporter.mjs:
class Client {
  constructor (apiKey) {
    console.log('apiKey', apiKey)

    this.apiKey = apiKey
  }
}

export default new Client(process.env.API_KEY)
index.mjs:
// Note: this is INCORRECT and will not work
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv'
dotenv.config()

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs' // process.env.API_KEY will be blank!
process.env.API_KEY will be blank.
Instead, index.mjs should be written as..
import 'dotenv/config'

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs'
Does that make sense? It's a bit unintuitive, but it is how importing of ES6 modules work. Here is a working example of this pitfall.
There are two alternatives to this approach:

Preload dotenv: node --require dotenv/config index.js (Note: you do not need to import dotenv with this approach)
Create a separate file that will execute config first as outlined in this comment on #133

Why am I getting the error Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'crypto|os|path'?
You are using dotenv on the front-end and have not included a polyfill. Webpack < 5 used to include these for you. Do the following:
npm install node-polyfill-webpack-plugin
Configure your webpack.config.js to something like the following.
require('dotenv').config()

const path = require('path');
const webpack = require('webpack')

const NodePolyfillPlugin = require('node-polyfill-webpack-plugin')

module.exports = {
  mode: 'development',
  entry: './src/index.ts',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  plugins: [
    new NodePolyfillPlugin(),
    new webpack.DefinePlugin({
      'process.env': {
        HELLO: JSON.stringify(process.env.HELLO)
      }
    }),
  ]
};
Alternatively, just use dotenv-webpack which does this and more behind the scenes for you.
What about variable expansion?
Try dotenv-expand
What about syncing and securing .env files?
Use dotenvx
What if I accidentally commit my .env file to code?
Remove it, remove git history and then install the git pre-commit hook to prevent this from ever happening again.
brew install dotenvx/brew/dotenvx
dotenvx precommit --install

How can I prevent committing my .env file to a Docker build?
Use the docker prebuild hook.
# Dockerfile
...
RUN curl -fsS https://dotenvx.sh/ | sh
...
RUN dotenvx prebuild
CMD ["dotenvx", "run", "--", "node", "index.js"]

dotenv 

Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology.

üå± Install
npm install dotenv --save
You can also use an npm-compatible package manager like yarn or bun:
yarn add dotenv
# or
bun add dotenv
üèóÔ∏è Usage






Create a .env file in the root of your project (if using a monorepo structure like apps/backend/app.js, put it in the root of the folder where your app.js process runs):
S3_BUCKET="YOURS3BUCKET"
SECRET_KEY="YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE"
As early as possible in your application, import and configure dotenv:
require('dotenv').config()
console.log(process.env) // remove this after you've confirmed it is working
.. or using ES6?
import 'dotenv/config'
That's it. process.env now has the keys and values you defined in your .env file:
require('dotenv').config()
// or import 'dotenv/config' if you're using ES6

...

s3.getBucketCors({Bucket: process.env.S3_BUCKET}, function(err, data) {})
Multiline values
If you need multiline variables, for example private keys, those are now supported (>= v15.0.0) with line breaks:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
...
Kh9NV...
...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
Alternatively, you can double quote strings and use the \n character:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nKh9NV...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
Comments
Comments may be added to your file on their own line or inline:
# This is a comment
SECRET_KEY=YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE # comment
SECRET_HASH="something-with-a-#-hash"
Comments begin where a # exists, so if your value contains a # please wrap it in quotes. This is a breaking change from >= v15.0.0 and on.
Parsing
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Preload

Note: Consider using dotenvx instead of preloading. I am now doing (and recommending) so.
It serves the same purpose (you do not need to require and load dotenv), adds better debugging, and works with ANY language, framework, or platform. ‚Äì motdotla

You can use the --require (-r) command line option to preload dotenv. By doing this, you do not need to require and load dotenv in your application code.
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
The configuration options below are supported as command line arguments in the format dotenv_config_<option>=value
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env dotenv_config_debug=true
Additionally, you can use environment variables to set configuration options. Command line arguments will precede these.
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_<OPTION>=value node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_ENCODING=latin1 DOTENV_CONFIG_DEBUG=true node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env
Variable Expansion
You need to add the value of another variable in one of your variables? Use dotenv-expand.
Command Substitution
Use dotenvx to use command substitution.
Add the output of a command to one of your variables in your .env file.
# .env
DATABASE_URL="postgres://$(whoami)@localhost/my_database"
// index.js
console.log('DATABASE_URL', process.env.DATABASE_URL)
$ dotenvx run --debug -- node index.js
[dotenvx@0.14.1] injecting env (1) from .env
DATABASE_URL postgres://yourusername@localhost/my_database
Syncing
You need to keep .env files in sync between machines, environments, or team members? Use dotenvx to encrypt your .env files and safely include them in source control. This still subscribes to the twelve-factor app rules by generating a decryption key separate from code.
Multiple Environments

You need to deploy your secrets in a cloud-agnostic manner? Use dotenvx to generate a private decryption key that is set on your production server.
üå¥ Manage Multiple Environments

üìñ Documentation
Dotenv exposes four functions:

config
parse
populate
decrypt

Config
config will read your .env file, parse the contents, assign it to
process.env,
and return an Object with a parsed key containing the loaded content or an error key if it failed.
const result = dotenv.config()

if (result.error) {
  throw result.error
}

console.log(result.parsed)
You can additionally, pass options to config.
Options
path
Default: path.resolve(process.cwd(), '.env')
Specify a custom path if your file containing environment variables is located elsewhere.
require('dotenv').config({ path: '/custom/path/to/.env' })
By default, config will look for a file called .env in the current working directory.
Pass in multiple files as an array, and they will be parsed in order and combined with process.env (or option.processEnv, if set). The first value set for a variable will win, unless the options.override flag is set, in which case the last value set will win.  If a value already exists in process.env and the options.override flag is NOT set, no changes will be made to that value.
require('dotenv').config({ path: ['.env.local', '.env'] })
encoding
Default: utf8
Specify the encoding of your file containing environment variables.
require('dotenv').config({ encoding: 'latin1' })
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
require('dotenv').config({ debug: process.env.DEBUG })
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set on your machine with values from your .env file(s). If multiple files have been provided in option.path the override will also be used as each file is combined with the next. Without override being set, the first value wins. With override set the last value wins.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
processEnv
Default: process.env
Specify an object to write your environment variables to. Defaults to process.env environment variables.
const myObject = {}
require('dotenv').config({ processEnv: myObject })

console.log(myObject) // values from .env
console.log(process.env) // this was not changed or written to
Parse
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment
variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return
an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Options
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('hello world')
const opt = { debug: true }
const config = dotenv.parse(buf, opt)
// expect a debug message because the buffer is not in KEY=VAL form
Populate
The engine which populates the contents of your .env file to process.env is available for use. It accepts a target, a source, and options. This is useful for power users who want to supply their own objects.
For example, customizing the source:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'world' }

dotenv.populate(process.env, parsed)

console.log(process.env.HELLO) // world
For example, customizing the source AND target:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'universe' }
const target = { HELLO: 'world' } // empty object

dotenv.populate(target, parsed, { override: true, debug: true })

console.log(target) // { HELLO: 'universe' }
options
Debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being populated as you expect.
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set.
‚ùì FAQ
Why is the .env file not loading my environment variables successfully?
Most likely your .env file is not in the correct place. See this stack overflow.
Turn on debug mode and try again..
require('dotenv').config({ debug: true })
You will receive a helpful error outputted to your console.
Should I commit my .env file?
No. We strongly recommend against committing your .env file to version
control. It should only include environment-specific values such as database
passwords or API keys. Your production database should have a different
password than your development database.
Should I have multiple .env files?
We recommend creating one .env file per environment. Use .env for local/development, .env.production for production and so on. This still follows the twelve factor principles as each is attributed individually to its own environment. Avoid custom set ups that work in inheritance somehow (.env.production inherits values form .env for example). It is better to duplicate values if necessary across each .env.environment file.

In a twelve-factor app, env vars are granular controls, each fully orthogonal to other env vars. They are never grouped together as ‚Äúenvironments‚Äù, but instead are independently managed for each deploy. This is a model that scales up smoothly as the app naturally expands into more deploys over its lifetime.
‚Äì The Twelve-Factor App

What rules does the parsing engine follow?
The parsing engine currently supports the following rules:

BASIC=basic becomes {BASIC: 'basic'}
empty lines are skipped
lines beginning with # are treated as comments
# marks the beginning of a comment (unless when the value is wrapped in quotes)
empty values become empty strings (EMPTY= becomes {EMPTY: ''})
inner quotes are maintained (think JSON) (JSON={"foo": "bar"} becomes {JSON:"{\"foo\": \"bar\"}")
whitespace is removed from both ends of unquoted values (see more on trim) (FOO=  some value   becomes {FOO: 'some value'})
single and double quoted values are escaped (SINGLE_QUOTE='quoted' becomes {SINGLE_QUOTE: "quoted"})
single and double quoted values maintain whitespace from both ends (FOO="  some value  " becomes {FOO: '  some value  '})
double quoted values expand new lines (MULTILINE="new\nline" becomes

{MULTILINE: 'new
line'}


backticks are supported (BACKTICK_KEY=`This has 'single' and "double" quotes inside of it.`)

What happens to environment variables that were already set?
By default, we will never modify any environment variables that have already been set. In particular, if there is a variable in your .env file which collides with one that already exists in your environment, then that variable will be skipped.
If instead, you want to override process.env use the override option.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
How come my environment variables are not showing up for React?
Your React code is run in Webpack, where the fs module or even the process global itself are not accessible out-of-the-box. process.env can only be injected through Webpack configuration.
If you are using react-scripts, which is distributed through create-react-app, it has dotenv built in but with a quirk. Preface your environment variables with REACT_APP_. See this stack overflow for more details.
If you are using other frameworks (e.g. Next.js, Gatsby...), you need to consult their documentation for how to inject environment variables into the client.
Can I customize/write plugins for dotenv?
Yes! dotenv.config() returns an object representing the parsed .env file. This gives you everything you need to continue setting values on process.env. For example:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const variableExpansion = require('dotenv-expand')
const myEnv = dotenv.config()
variableExpansion(myEnv)
How do I use dotenv with import?
Simply..
// index.mjs (ESM)
import 'dotenv/config' // see https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#how-do-i-use-dotenv-with-import
import express from 'express'
A little background..

When you run a module containing an import declaration, the modules it imports are loaded first, then each module body is executed in a depth-first traversal of the dependency graph, avoiding cycles by skipping anything already executed.
‚Äì ES6 In Depth: Modules

What does this mean in plain language? It means you would think the following would work but it won't.
errorReporter.mjs:
class Client {
  constructor (apiKey) {
    console.log('apiKey', apiKey)

    this.apiKey = apiKey
  }
}

export default new Client(process.env.API_KEY)
index.mjs:
// Note: this is INCORRECT and will not work
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv'
dotenv.config()

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs' // process.env.API_KEY will be blank!
process.env.API_KEY will be blank.
Instead, index.mjs should be written as..
import 'dotenv/config'

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs'
Does that make sense? It's a bit unintuitive, but it is how importing of ES6 modules work. Here is a working example of this pitfall.
There are two alternatives to this approach:

Preload dotenv: node --require dotenv/config index.js (Note: you do not need to import dotenv with this approach)
Create a separate file that will execute config first as outlined in this comment on #133

Why am I getting the error Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'crypto|os|path'?
You are using dotenv on the front-end and have not included a polyfill. Webpack < 5 used to include these for you. Do the following:
npm install node-polyfill-webpack-plugin
Configure your webpack.config.js to something like the following.
require('dotenv').config()

const path = require('path');
const webpack = require('webpack')

const NodePolyfillPlugin = require('node-polyfill-webpack-plugin')

module.exports = {
  mode: 'development',
  entry: './src/index.ts',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  plugins: [
    new NodePolyfillPlugin(),
    new webpack.DefinePlugin({
      'process.env': {
        HELLO: JSON.stringify(process.env.HELLO)
      }
    }),
  ]
};
Alternatively, just use dotenv-webpack which does this and more behind the scenes for you.
What about variable expansion?
Try dotenv-expand
What about syncing and securing .env files?
Use dotenvx
What if I accidentally commit my .env file to code?
Remove it, remove git history and then install the git pre-commit hook to prevent this from ever happening again.
brew install dotenvx/brew/dotenvx
dotenvx precommit --install

How can I prevent committing my .env file to a Docker build?
Use the docker prebuild hook.
# Dockerfile
...
RUN curl -fsS https://dotenvx.sh/ | sh
...
RUN dotenvx prebuild
CMD ["dotenvx", "run", "--", "node", "index.js"]

dotenv 

Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology.

üå± Install
npm install dotenv --save
You can also use an npm-compatible package manager like yarn or bun:
yarn add dotenv
# or
bun add dotenv
üèóÔ∏è Usage






Create a .env file in the root of your project (if using a monorepo structure like apps/backend/app.js, put it in the root of the folder where your app.js process runs):
S3_BUCKET="YOURS3BUCKET"
SECRET_KEY="YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE"
As early as possible in your application, import and configure dotenv:
require('dotenv').config()
console.log(process.env) // remove this after you've confirmed it is working
.. or using ES6?
import 'dotenv/config'
That's it. process.env now has the keys and values you defined in your .env file:
require('dotenv').config()
// or import 'dotenv/config' if you're using ES6

...

s3.getBucketCors({Bucket: process.env.S3_BUCKET}, function(err, data) {})
Multiline values
If you need multiline variables, for example private keys, those are now supported (>= v15.0.0) with line breaks:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
...
Kh9NV...
...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
Alternatively, you can double quote strings and use the \n character:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nKh9NV...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
Comments
Comments may be added to your file on their own line or inline:
# This is a comment
SECRET_KEY=YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE # comment
SECRET_HASH="something-with-a-#-hash"
Comments begin where a # exists, so if your value contains a # please wrap it in quotes. This is a breaking change from >= v15.0.0 and on.
Parsing
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Preload

Note: Consider using dotenvx instead of preloading. I am now doing (and recommending) so.
It serves the same purpose (you do not need to require and load dotenv), adds better debugging, and works with ANY language, framework, or platform. ‚Äì motdotla

You can use the --require (-r) command line option to preload dotenv. By doing this, you do not need to require and load dotenv in your application code.
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
The configuration options below are supported as command line arguments in the format dotenv_config_<option>=value
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env dotenv_config_debug=true
Additionally, you can use environment variables to set configuration options. Command line arguments will precede these.
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_<OPTION>=value node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_ENCODING=latin1 DOTENV_CONFIG_DEBUG=true node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env
Variable Expansion
You need to add the value of another variable in one of your variables? Use dotenv-expand.
Command Substitution
Use dotenvx to use command substitution.
Add the output of a command to one of your variables in your .env file.
# .env
DATABASE_URL="postgres://$(whoami)@localhost/my_database"
// index.js
console.log('DATABASE_URL', process.env.DATABASE_URL)
$ dotenvx run --debug -- node index.js
[dotenvx@0.14.1] injecting env (1) from .env
DATABASE_URL postgres://yourusername@localhost/my_database
Syncing
You need to keep .env files in sync between machines, environments, or team members? Use dotenvx to encrypt your .env files and safely include them in source control. This still subscribes to the twelve-factor app rules by generating a decryption key separate from code.
Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx to generate .env.ci, .env.production files, and more.
Deploying
You need to deploy your secrets in a cloud-agnostic manner? Use dotenvx to generate a private decryption key that is set on your production server.
üå¥ Manage Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx
Run any environment locally. Create a .env.ENVIRONMENT file and use --env-file to load it. It's straightforward, yet flexible.
$ echo "HELLO=production" > .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.production -- node index.js
Hello production
> ^^
or with multiple .env files
$ echo "HELLO=local" > .env.local
$ echo "HELLO=World" > .env
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.local --env-file=.env -- node index.js
Hello local
more environment examples
üöÄ Deploying
Use dotenvx.
Add encryption to your .env files with a single command. Pass the --encrypt flag.
$ dotenvx set HELLO Production --encrypt -f .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION="<.env.production private key>" dotenvx run -- node index.js
[dotenvx] injecting env (2) from .env.production
Hello Production

Dotenv exposes four functions:

config
parse
populate
decrypt

Config
config will read your .env file, parse the contents, assign it to
process.env,
and return an Object with a parsed key containing the loaded content or an error key if it failed.
const result = dotenv.config()

if (result.error) {
  throw result.error
}

console.log(result.parsed)
You can additionally, pass options to config.
Options
path
Default: path.resolve(process.cwd(), '.env')
Specify a custom path if your file containing environment variables is located elsewhere.
require('dotenv').config({ path: '/custom/path/to/.env' })
By default, config will look for a file called .env in the current working directory.
Pass in multiple files as an array, and they will be parsed in order and combined with process.env (or option.processEnv, if set). The first value set for a variable will win, unless the options.override flag is set, in which case the last value set will win.  If a value already exists in process.env and the options.override flag is NOT set, no changes will be made to that value.
require('dotenv').config({ path: ['.env.local', '.env'] })
encoding
Default: utf8
Specify the encoding of your file containing environment variables.
require('dotenv').config({ encoding: 'latin1' })
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
require('dotenv').config({ debug: process.env.DEBUG })
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set on your machine with values from your .env file(s). If multiple files have been provided in option.path the override will also be used as each file is combined with the next. Without override being set, the first value wins. With override set the last value wins.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
processEnv
Default: process.env
Specify an object to write your environment variables to. Defaults to process.env environment variables.
const myObject = {}
require('dotenv').config({ processEnv: myObject })

console.log(myObject) // values from .env
console.log(process.env) // this was not changed or written to
Parse
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment
variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return
an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Options
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('hello world')
const opt = { debug: true }
const config = dotenv.parse(buf, opt)
// expect a debug message because the buffer is not in KEY=VAL form
Populate
The engine which populates the contents of your .env file to process.env is available for use. It accepts a target, a source, and options. This is useful for power users who want to supply their own objects.
For example, customizing the source:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'world' }

dotenv.populate(process.env, parsed)

console.log(process.env.HELLO) // world
For example, customizing the source AND target:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'universe' }
const target = { HELLO: 'world' } // empty object

dotenv.populate(target, parsed, { override: true, debug: true })

console.log(target) // { HELLO: 'universe' }
options
Debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being populated as you expect.
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set.

Avoid custom set ups that work in inheritance somehow (.env.production inherits values form .env for example). It is better to duplicate values if necessary across each .env.environment file.

In a twelve-factor app, env vars are granular controls, each fully orthogonal to other env vars. They are never grouped together as ‚Äúenvironments‚Äù, but instead are independently managed for each deploy. This is a model that scales up smoothly as the app naturally expands into more deploys over its lifetime.
‚Äì The Twelve-Factor App

What rules does the parsing engine follow?
The parsing engine currently supports the following rules:

BASIC=basic becomes {BASIC: 'basic'}
empty lines are skipped
lines beginning with # are treated as comments
# marks the beginning of a comment (unless when the value is wrapped in quotes)
empty values become empty strings (EMPTY= becomes {EMPTY: ''})
inner quotes are maintained (think JSON) (JSON={"foo": "bar"} becomes {JSON:"{\"foo\": \"bar\"}")
whitespace is removed from both ends of unquoted values (see more on trim) (FOO=  some value   becomes {FOO: 'some value'})
single and double quoted values are escaped (SINGLE_QUOTE='quoted' becomes {SINGLE_QUOTE: "quoted"})
single and double quoted values maintain whitespace from both ends (FOO="  some value  " becomes {FOO: '  some value  '})
double quoted values expand new lines (MULTILINE="new\nline" becomes

{MULTILINE: 'new
line'}


backticks are supported (BACKTICK_KEY=`This has 'single' and "double" quotes inside of it.`)

What happens to environment variables that were already set?
By default, we will never modify any environment variables that have already been set. In particular, if there is a variable in your .env file which collides with one that already exists in your environment, then that variable will be skipped.
If instead, you want to override process.env use the override option.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
How come my environment variables are not showing up for React?
Your React code is run in Webpack, where the fs module or even the process global itself are not accessible out-of-the-box. process.env can only be injected through Webpack configuration.
If you are using react-scripts, which is distributed through create-react-app, it has dotenv built in but with a quirk. Preface your environment variables with REACT_APP_. See this stack overflow for more details.
If you are using other frameworks (e.g. Next.js, Gatsby...), you need to consult their documentation for how to inject environment variables into the client.
Can I customize/write plugins for dotenv?
Yes! dotenv.config() returns an object representing the parsed .env file. This gives you everything you need to continue setting values on process.env. For example:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const variableExpansion = require('dotenv-expand')
const myEnv = dotenv.config()
variableExpansion(myEnv)
How do I use dotenv with import?
Simply..
// index.mjs (ESM)
import 'dotenv/config' // see https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#how-do-i-use-dotenv-with-import
import express from 'express'
A little background..

When you run a module containing an import declaration, the modules it imports are loaded first, then each module body is executed in a depth-first traversal of the dependency graph, avoiding cycles by skipping anything already executed.
‚Äì ES6 In Depth: Modules

What does this mean in plain language? It means you would think the following would work but it won't.
errorReporter.mjs:
class Client {
  constructor (apiKey) {
    console.log('apiKey', apiKey)

    this.apiKey = apiKey
  }
}

export default new Client(process.env.API_KEY)
index.mjs:
// Note: this is INCORRECT and will not work
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv'
dotenv.config()

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs' // process.env.API_KEY will be blank!
process.env.API_KEY will be blank.
Instead, index.mjs should be written as..
import 'dotenv/config'

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs'
Does that make sense? It's a bit unintuitive, but it is how importing of ES6 modules work. Here is a working example of this pitfall.
There are two alternatives to this approach:

Preload dotenv: node --require dotenv/config index.js (Note: you do not need to import dotenv with this approach)
Create a separate file that will execute config first as outlined in this comment on #133

Why am I getting the error Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'crypto|os|path'?
You are using dotenv on the front-end and have not included a polyfill. Webpack < 5 used to include these for you. Do the following:
npm install node-polyfill-webpack-plugin
Configure your webpack.config.js to something like the following.
require('dotenv').config()

const path = require('path');
const webpack = require('webpack')

const NodePolyfillPlugin = require('node-polyfill-webpack-plugin')

module.exports = {
  mode: 'development',
  entry: './src/index.ts',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  plugins: [
    new NodePolyfillPlugin(),
    new webpack.DefinePlugin({
      'process.env': {
        HELLO: JSON.stringify(process.env.HELLO)
      }
    }),
  ]
};
Alternatively, just use dotenv-webpack which does this and more behind the scenes for you.
What about variable expansion?
Try dotenv-expand
What about syncing and securing .env files?
Use dotenvx
What if I accidentally commit my .env file to code?
Remove it, remove git history and then install the git pre-commit hook to prevent this from ever happening again.
brew install dotenvx/brew/dotenvx
dotenvx precommit --install

How can I prevent committing my .env file to a Docker build?
Use the docker prebuild hook.
# Dockerfile
...
RUN curl -fsS https://dotenvx.sh/ | sh
...
RUN dotenvx prebuild
CMD ["dotenvx", "run", "--", "node", "index.js"]

dotenv 

Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology.

üå± Install
npm install dotenv --save
You can also use an npm-compatible package manager like yarn or bun:
yarn add dotenv
# or
bun add dotenv
üèóÔ∏è Usage






Create a .env file in the root of your project (if using a monorepo structure like apps/backend/app.js, put it in the root of the folder where your app.js process runs):
S3_BUCKET="YOURS3BUCKET"
SECRET_KEY="YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE"
As early as possible in your application, import and configure dotenv:
require('dotenv').config()
console.log(process.env) // remove this after you've confirmed it is working
.. or using ES6?
import 'dotenv/config'
That's it. process.env now has the keys and values you defined in your .env file:
require('dotenv').config()
// or import 'dotenv/config' if you're using ES6

...

s3.getBucketCors({Bucket: process.env.S3_BUCKET}, function(err, data) {})
Multiline values
If you need multiline variables, for example private keys, those are now supported (>= v15.0.0) with line breaks:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
...
Kh9NV...
...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
Alternatively, you can double quote strings and use the \n character:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nKh9NV...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
Comments
Comments may be added to your file on their own line or inline:
# This is a comment
SECRET_KEY=YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE # comment
SECRET_HASH="something-with-a-#-hash"
Comments begin where a # exists, so if your value contains a # please wrap it in quotes. This is a breaking change from >= v15.0.0 and on.
Parsing
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Preload

Note: Consider using dotenvx instead of preloading. I am now doing (and recommending) so.
It serves the same purpose (you do not need to require and load dotenv), adds better debugging, and works with ANY language, framework, or platform. ‚Äì motdotla

You can use the --require (-r) command line option to preload dotenv. By doing this, you do not need to require and load dotenv in your application code.
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
The configuration options below are supported as command line arguments in the format dotenv_config_<option>=value
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env dotenv_config_debug=true
Additionally, you can use environment variables to set configuration options. Command line arguments will precede these.
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_<OPTION>=value node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_ENCODING=latin1 DOTENV_CONFIG_DEBUG=true node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env
Variable Expansion
You need to add the value of another variable in one of your variables? Use dotenv-expand.
Command Substitution
Use dotenvx to use command substitution.
Add the output of a command to one of your variables in your .env file.
# .env
DATABASE_URL="postgres://$(whoami)@localhost/my_database"
// index.js
console.log('DATABASE_URL', process.env.DATABASE_URL)
$ dotenvx run --debug -- node index.js
[dotenvx@0.14.1] injecting env (1) from .env
DATABASE_URL postgres://yourusername@localhost/my_database
Syncing
You need to keep .env files in sync between machines, environments, or team members? Use dotenvx to encrypt your .env files and safely include them in source control. This still subscribes to the twelve-factor app rules by generating a decryption key separate from code.
Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx to generate .env.ci, .env.production files, and more.
Deploying
You need to deploy your secrets in a cloud-agnostic manner? Use dotenvx to generate a private decryption key that is set on your production server.
üå¥ Manage Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx
Run any environment locally. Create a .env.ENVIRONMENT file and use --env-file to load it. It's straightforward, yet flexible.
$ echo "HELLO=production" > .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.production -- node index.js
Hello production
> ^^
or with multiple .env files
$ echo "HELLO=local" > .env.local
$ echo "HELLO=World" > .env
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.local --env-file=.env -- node index.js
Hello local
more environment examples
üöÄ Deploying
Use dotenvx.
Add encryption to your .env files with a single command. Pass the --encrypt flag.
$ dotenvx set HELLO Production --encrypt -f .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION="<.env.production private key>" dotenvx run -- node index.js
[dotenvx] injecting env (2) from .env.production
Hello Production

üìñ Documentation
Dotenv exposes four functions:

config
parse
populate
decrypt

Config
config will read your .env file, parse the contents, assign it to
process.env,
and return an Object with a parsed key containing the loaded content or an error key if it failed.
const result = dotenv.config()

if (result.error) {
  throw result.error
}

console.log(result.parsed)
You can additionally, pass options to config.
Options
path
Default: path.resolve(process.cwd(), '.env')
Specify a custom path if your file containing environment variables is located elsewhere.
require('dotenv').config({ path: '/custom/path/to/.env' })
By default, config will look for a file called .env in the current working directory.
Pass in multiple files as an array, and they will be parsed in order and combined with process.env (or option.processEnv, if set). The first value set for a variable will win, unless the options.override flag is set, in which case the last value set will win.  If a value already exists in process.env and the options.override flag is NOT set, no changes will be made to that value.
require('dotenv').config({ path: ['.env.local', '.env'] })
encoding
Default: utf8
Specify the encoding of your file containing environment variables.
require('dotenv').config({ encoding: 'latin1' })
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
require('dotenv').config({ debug: process.env.DEBUG })
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set on your machine with values from your .env file(s). If multiple files have been provided in option.path the override will also be used as each file is combined with the next. Without override being set, the first value wins. With override set the last value wins.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
processEnv
Default: process.env
Specify an object to write your environment variables to. Defaults to process.env environment variables.
const myObject = {}
require('dotenv').config({ processEnv: myObject })

console.log(myObject) // values from .env
console.log(process.env) // this was not changed or written to
Parse
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment
variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return
an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Options
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('hello world')
const opt = { debug: true }
const config = dotenv.parse(buf, opt)
// expect a debug message because the buffer is not in KEY=VAL form
Populate
The engine which populates the contents of your .env file to process.env is available for use. It accepts a target, a source, and options. This is useful for power users who want to supply their own objects.
For example, customizing the source:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'world' }

dotenv.populate(process.env, parsed)

console.log(process.env.HELLO) // world
For example, customizing the source AND target:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'universe' }
const target = { HELLO: 'world' } // empty object

dotenv.populate(target, parsed, { override: true, debug: true })

console.log(target) // { HELLO: 'universe' }
options
Debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being populated as you expect.
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set.
‚ùì FAQ
Why is the .env file not loading my environment variables successfully?
Most likely your .env file is not in the correct place. See this stack overflow.
Turn on debug mode and try again..
require('dotenv').config({ debug: true })
You will receive a helpful error outputted to your console.
Should I commit my .env file?
No. We strongly recommend against committing your .env file to version
control. It should only include environment-specific values such as database
passwords or API keys. Your production database should have a different
password than your development database.
Should I have multiple .env files?
We recommend creating one .env file per environment. Use .env for local/development, .env.production for production and so on. This still follows the twelve factor principles as each is attributed individually to its own environment. Avoid custom set ups that work in inheritance somehow (.env.production inherits values form .env for example). It is better to duplicate values if necessary across each .env.environment file.

In a twelve-factor app, env vars are granular controls, each fully orthogonal to other env vars. They are never grouped together as ‚Äúenvironments‚Äù, but instead are independently managed for each deploy. This is a model that scales up smoothly as the app naturally expands into more deploys over its lifetime.

errorReporter.mjs:

Does that make sense? It's a bit unintuitive, but it is how importing of ES6 modules work. Here is a working example of this pitfall.
There are two alternatives to this approach:

You are using dotenv on the front-end and have not included a polyfill. Webpack < 5 used to include these for you. Do the following:
npm install node-polyfill-webpack-plugin
Configure your webpack.config.js to something like the following.
require('dotenv').config()

const path = require('path');
const webpack = require('webpack')

const NodePolyfillPlugin = require('node-polyfill-webpack-plugin')

module.exports = {
  mode: 'development',
  entry: './src/index.ts',

Try dotenv-expand
What about syncing and securing .env files?
Use dotenvx
What if I accidentally commit my .env file to code?
Remove it, remove git history and then install the git pre-commit hook to prevent this from ever happening again.
brew install dotenvx/brew/dotenvx
dotenvx precommit --install

How can I prevent committing my .env file to a Docker build?
Use the docker prebuild hook.
# Dockerfile

dotenv 

Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology.

üå± Install
npm install dotenv --save
You can also use an npm-compatible package manager like yarn or bun:
yarn add dotenv
# or
bun add dotenv
üèóÔ∏è Usage






Create a .env file in the root of your project (if using a monorepo structure like apps/backend/app.js, put it in the root of the folder where your app.js process runs):
S3_BUCKET="YOURS3BUCKET"
SECRET_KEY="YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE"
As early as possible in your application, import and configure dotenv:
require('dotenv').config()
console.log(process.env) // remove this after you've confirmed it is working
.. or using ES6?
import 'dotenv/config'
That's it. process.env now has the keys and values you defined in your .env file:
require('dotenv').config()
// or import 'dotenv/config' if you're using ES6

...

s3.getBucketCors({Bucket: process.env.S3_BUCKET}, function(err, data) {})
Multiline values
If you need multiline variables, for example private keys, those are now supported (>= v15.0.0) with line breaks:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
...
Kh9NV...
...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
Alternatively, you can double quote strings and use the \n character:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nKh9NV...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
Comments
Comments may be added to your file on their own line or inline:
# This is a comment
SECRET_KEY=YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE # comment
SECRET_HASH="something-with-a-#-hash"
Comments begin where a # exists, so if your value contains a # please wrap it in quotes. This is a breaking change from >= v15.0.0 and on.
Parsing
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Preload

Note: Consider using dotenvx instead of preloading. I am now doing (and recommending) so.
It serves the same purpose (you do not need to require and load dotenv), adds better debugging, and works with ANY language, framework, or platform. ‚Äì motdotla

You can use the --require (-r) command line option to preload dotenv. By doing this, you do not need to require and load dotenv in your application code.
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
The configuration options below are supported as command line arguments in the format dotenv_config_<option>=value
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env dotenv_config_debug=true
Additionally, you can use environment variables to set configuration options. Command line arguments will precede these.
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_<OPTION>=value node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_ENCODING=latin1 DOTENV_CONFIG_DEBUG=true node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env
Variable Expansion
You need to add the value of another variable in one of your variables? Use dotenv-expand.
Command Substitution
Use dotenvx to use command substitution.
Add the output of a command to one of your variables in your .env file.
# .env
DATABASE_URL="postgres://$(whoami)@localhost/my_database"
// index.js
console.log('DATABASE_URL', process.env.DATABASE_URL)
$ dotenvx run --debug -- node index.js
[dotenvx@0.14.1] injecting env (1) from .env
DATABASE_URL postgres://yourusername@localhost/my_database
Syncing
You need to keep .env files in sync between machines, environments, or team members? Use dotenvx to encrypt your .env files and safely include them in source control. This still subscribes to the twelve-factor app rules by generating a decryption key separate from code.
Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx to generate .env.ci, .env.production files, and more.
Deploying
You need to deploy your secrets in a cloud-agnostic manner? Use dotenvx to generate a private decryption key that is set on your production server.
üå¥ Manage Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx
Run any environment locally. Create a .env.ENVIRONMENT file and use --env-file to load it. It's straightforward, yet flexible.
$ echo "HELLO=production" > .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.production -- node index.js
Hello production
> ^^
or with multiple .env files
$ echo "HELLO=local" > .env.local
$ echo "HELLO=World" > .env
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.local --env-file=.env -- node index.js
Hello local
more environment examples
üöÄ Deploying
Use dotenvx.
Add encryption to your .env files with a single command. Pass the --encrypt flag.
$ dotenvx set HELLO Production --encrypt -f .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION="<.env.production private key>" dotenvx run -- node index.js
[dotenvx] injecting env (2) from .env.production
Hello Production

üìñ Documentation
Dotenv exposes four functions:

config
parse
populate
decrypt

Config
config will read your .env file, parse the contents, assign it to
process.env,
and return an Object with a parsed key containing the loaded content or an error key if it failed.
const result = dotenv.config()

if (result.error) {
  throw result.error
}

console.log(result.parsed)
You can additionally, pass options to config.
Options
path
Default: path.resolve(process.cwd(), '.env')
Specify a custom path if your file containing environment variables is located elsewhere.
require('dotenv').config({ path: '/custom/path/to/.env' })
By default, config will look for a file called .env in the current working directory.
Pass in multiple files as an array, and they will be parsed in order and combined with process.env (or option.processEnv, if set). The first value set for a variable will win, unless the options.override flag is set, in which case the last value set will win.  If a value already exists in process.env and the options.override flag is NOT set, no changes will be made to that value.
require('dotenv').config({ path: ['.env.local', '.env'] })
encoding
Default: utf8
Specify the encoding of your file containing environment variables.
require('dotenv').config({ encoding: 'latin1' })
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
require('dotenv').config({ debug: process.env.DEBUG })
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set on your machine with values from your .env file(s). If multiple files have been provided in option.path the override will also be used as each file is combined with the next. Without override being set, the first value wins. With override set the last value wins.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
processEnv
Default: process.env
Specify an object to write your environment variables to. Defaults to process.env environment variables.
const myObject = {}
require('dotenv').config({ processEnv: myObject })

console.log(myObject) // values from .env
console.log(process.env) // this was not changed or written to
Parse
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment
variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return
an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Options
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('hello world')
const opt = { debug: true }
const config = dotenv.parse(buf, opt)
// expect a debug message because the buffer is not in KEY=VAL form
Populate
The engine which populates the contents of your .env file to process.env is available for use. It accepts a target, a source, and options. This is useful for power users who want to supply their own objects.
For example, customizing the source:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'world' }

dotenv.populate(process.env, parsed)

console.log(process.env.HELLO) // world
For example, customizing the source AND target:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'universe' }
const target = { HELLO: 'world' } // empty object

dotenv.populate(target, parsed, { override: true, debug: true })

console.log(target) // { HELLO: 'universe' }
options
Debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being populated as you expect.
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set.
‚ùì FAQ
Why is the .env file not loading my environment variables successfully?
Most likely your .env file is not in the correct place. See this stack overflow.
Turn on debug mode and try again..
require('dotenv').config({ debug: true })
You will receive a helpful error outputted to your console.
Should I commit my .env file?
No. We strongly recommend against committing your .env file to version
control. It should only include environment-specific values such as database
passwords or API keys. Your production database should have a different
password than your development database.
Should I have multiple .env files?
We recommend creating one .env file per environment. Use .env for local/development, .env.production for production and so on. This still follows the twelve factor principles as each is attributed individually to its own environment. Avoid custom set ups that work in inheritance somehow (.env.production inherits values form .env for example). It is better to duplicate values if necessary across each .env.environment file.

In a twelve-factor app, env vars are granular controls, each fully orthogonal to other env vars. They are never grouped together as ‚Äúenvironments‚Äù, but instead are independently managed for each deploy. This is a model that scales up smoothly as the app naturally expands into more deploys over its lifetime.
‚Äì The Twelve-Factor App

What rules does the parsing engine follow?
The parsing engine currently supports the following rules:

BASIC=basic becomes {BASIC: 'basic'}
empty lines are skipped
lines beginning with # are treated as comments
# marks the beginning of a comment (unless when the value is wrapped in quotes)
empty values become empty strings (EMPTY= becomes {EMPTY: ''})
inner quotes are maintained (think JSON) (JSON={"foo": "bar"} becomes {JSON:"{\"foo\": \"bar\"}")
whitespace is removed from both ends of unquoted values (see more on trim) (FOO=  some value   becomes {FOO: 'some value'})
single and double quoted values are escaped (SINGLE_QUOTE='quoted' becomes {SINGLE_QUOTE: "quoted"})
single and double quoted values maintain whitespace from both ends (FOO="  some value  " becomes {FOO: '  some value  '})
double quoted values expand new lines (MULTILINE="new\nline" becomes

{MULTILINE: 'new
line'}


backticks are supported (BACKTICK_KEY=`This has 'single' and "double" quotes inside of it.`)

What happens to environment variables that were already set?
By default, we will never modify any environment variables that have already been set. In particular, if there is a variable in your .env file which collides with one that already exists in your environment, then that variable will be skipped.
If instead, you want to override process.env use the override option.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
How come my environment variables are not showing up for React?
Your React code is run in Webpack, where the fs module or even the process global itself are not accessible out-of-the-box. process.env can only be injected through Webpack configuration.
If you are using react-scripts, which is distributed through create-react-app, it has dotenv built in but with a quirk. Preface your environment variables with REACT_APP_. See this stack overflow for more details.
If you are using other frameworks (e.g. Next.js, Gatsby...), you need to consult their documentation for how to inject environment variables into the client.
Can I customize/write plugins for dotenv?
Yes! dotenv.config() returns an object representing the parsed .env file. This gives you everything you need to continue setting values on process.env. For example:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const variableExpansion = require('dotenv-expand')
const myEnv = dotenv.config()
variableExpansion(myEnv)
How do I use dotenv with import?
Simply..
// index.mjs (ESM)
import 'dotenv/config' // see https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#how-do-i-use-dotenv-with-import
import express from 'express'
A little background..

When you run a module containing an import declaration, the modules it imports are loaded first, then each module body is executed in a depth-first traversal of the dependency graph, avoiding cycles by skipping anything already executed.
‚Äì ES6 In Depth: Modules

What does this mean in plain language? It means you would think the following would work but it won't.
errorReporter.mjs:
class Client {
  constructor (apiKey) {
    console.log('apiKey', apiKey)

    this.apiKey = apiKey
  }
}

export default new Client(process.env.API_KEY)
index.mjs:
// Note: this is INCORRECT and will not work
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv'
dotenv.config()

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs' // process.env.API_KEY will be blank!
process.env.API_KEY will be blank.
Instead, index.mjs should be written as..
import 'dotenv/config'

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs'
Does that make sense? It's a bit unintuitive, but it is how importing of ES6 modules work. Here is a working example of this pitfall.
There are two alternatives to this approach:

Preload dotenv: node --require dotenv/config index.js (Note: you do not need to import dotenv with this approach)
Create a separate file that will execute config first as outlined in this comment on #133

Why am I getting the error Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'crypto|os|path'?
You are using dotenv on the front-end and have not included a polyfill. Webpack < 5 used to include these for you. Do the following:
npm install node-polyfill-webpack-plugin
Configure your webpack.config.js to something like the following.
require('dotenv').config()

const path = require('path');
const webpack = require('webpack')

const NodePolyfillPlugin = require('node-polyfill-webpack-plugin')

module.exports = {
  mode: 'development',
  entry: './src/index.ts',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  plugins: [
    new NodePolyfillPlugin(),
    new webpack.DefinePlugin({
      'process.env': {
        HELLO: JSON.stringify(process.env.HELLO)
      }
    }),
  ]
};
Alternatively, just use dotenv-webpack which does this and more behind the scenes for you.
What about variable expansion?
Try dotenv-expand
What about syncing and securing .env files?
Use dotenvx
What if I accidentally commit my .env file to code?
Remove it, remove git history and then install the git pre-commit hook to prevent this from ever happening again.
brew install dotenvx/brew/dotenvx
dotenvx precommit --install

How can I prevent committing my .env file to a Docker build?
Use the docker prebuild hook.

dotenv 

Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology.

üå± Install
npm install dotenv --save
You can also use an npm-compatible package manager like yarn or bun:
yarn add dotenv
# or
bun add dotenv
üèóÔ∏è Usage






Create a .env file in the root of your project (if using a monorepo structure like apps/backend/app.js, put it in the root of the folder where your app.js process runs):
S3_BUCKET="YOURS3BUCKET"
SECRET_KEY="YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE"
As early as possible in your application, import and configure dotenv:
require('dotenv').config()
console.log(process.env) // remove this after you've confirmed it is working
.. or using ES6?
import 'dotenv/config'
That's it. process.env now has the keys and values you defined in your .env file:
require('dotenv').config()
// or import 'dotenv/config' if you're using ES6

...

s3.getBucketCors({Bucket: process.env.S3_BUCKET}, function(err, data) {})
Multiline values
If you need multiline variables, for example private keys, those are now supported (>= v15.0.0) with line breaks:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
...
Kh9NV...
...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
Alternatively, you can double quote strings and use the \n character:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nKh9NV...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
Comments
Comments may be added to your file on their own line or inline:
# This is a comment
SECRET_KEY=YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE # comment
SECRET_HASH="something-with-a-#-hash"
Comments begin where a # exists, so if your value contains a # please wrap it in quotes. This is a breaking change from >= v15.0.0 and on.
Parsing
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Preload

Note: Consider using dotenvx instead of preloading. I am now doing (and recommending) so.
It serves the same purpose (you do not need to require and load dotenv), adds better debugging, and works with ANY language, framework, or platform. ‚Äì motdotla

You can use the --require (-r) command line option to preload dotenv. By doing this, you do not need to require and load dotenv in your application code.
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
The configuration options below are supported as command line arguments in the format dotenv_config_<option>=value
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env dotenv_config_debug=true
Additionally, you can use environment variables to set configuration options. Command line arguments will precede these.
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_<OPTION>=value node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_ENCODING=latin1 DOTENV_CONFIG_DEBUG=true node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env
Variable Expansion
You need to add the value of another variable in one of your variables? Use dotenv-expand.
Command Substitution
Use dotenvx to use command substitution.
Add the output of a command to one of your variables in your .env file.
# .env
DATABASE_URL="postgres://$(whoami)@localhost/my_database"
// index.js
console.log('DATABASE_URL', process.env.DATABASE_URL)
$ dotenvx run --debug -- node index.js
[dotenvx@0.14.1] injecting env (1) from .env
DATABASE_URL postgres://yourusername@localhost/my_database
Syncing
You need to keep .env files in sync between machines, environments, or team members? Use dotenvx to encrypt your .env files and safely include them in source control. This still subscribes to the twelve-factor app rules by generating a decryption key separate from code.
Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx to generate .env.ci, .env.production files, and more.
Deploying
You need to deploy your secrets in a cloud-agnostic manner? Use dotenvx to generate a private decryption key that is set on your production server.
üå¥ Manage Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx
Run any environment locally. Create a .env.ENVIRONMENT file and use --env-file to load it. It's straightforward, yet flexible.
$ echo "HELLO=production" > .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.production -- node index.js
Hello production
> ^^
or with multiple .env files
$ echo "HELLO=local" > .env.local
$ echo "HELLO=World" > .env
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.local --env-file=.env -- node index.js
Hello local
more environment examples
üöÄ Deploying
Use dotenvx.
Add encryption to your .env files with a single command. Pass the --encrypt flag.
$ dotenvx set HELLO Production --encrypt -f .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION="<.env.production private key>" dotenvx run -- node index.js
[dotenvx] injecting env (2) from .env.production
Hello Production

üìñ Documentation
Dotenv exposes four functions:

config
parse
populate
decrypt

Config
config will read your .env file, parse the contents, assign it to
process.env,
and return an Object with a parsed key containing the loaded content or an error key if it failed.
const result = dotenv.config()

if (result.error) {
  throw result.error
}

console.log(result.parsed)
You can additionally, pass options to config.
Options
path
Default: path.resolve(process.cwd(), '.env')
Specify a custom path if your file containing environment variables is located elsewhere.
require('dotenv').config({ path: '/custom/path/to/.env' })
By default, config will look for a file called .env in the current working directory.
Pass in multiple files as an array, and they will be parsed in order and combined with process.env (or option.processEnv, if set). The first value set for a variable will win, unless the options.override flag is set, in which case the last value set will win.  If a value already exists in process.env and the options.override flag is NOT set, no changes will be made to that value.
require('dotenv').config({ path: ['.env.local', '.env'] })
encoding
Default: utf8
Specify the encoding of your file containing environment variables.
require('dotenv').config({ encoding: 'latin1' })
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
require('dotenv').config({ debug: process.env.DEBUG })
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set on your machine with values from your .env file(s). If multiple files have been provided in option.path the override will also be used as each file is combined with the next. Without override being set, the first value wins. With override set the last value wins.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
processEnv
Default: process.env
Specify an object to write your environment variables to. Defaults to process.env environment variables.
const myObject = {}
require('dotenv').config({ processEnv: myObject })

console.log(myObject) // values from .env
console.log(process.env) // this was not changed or written to
Parse
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment
variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return
an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Options
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('hello world')
const opt = { debug: true }
const config = dotenv.parse(buf, opt)
// expect a debug message because the buffer is not in KEY=VAL form
Populate
The engine which populates the contents of your .env file to process.env is available for use. It accepts a target, a source, and options. This is useful for power users who want to supply their own objects.
For example, customizing the source:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'world' }

dotenv.populate(process.env, parsed)

console.log(process.env.HELLO) // world
For example, customizing the source AND target:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'universe' }
const target = { HELLO: 'world' } // empty object

dotenv.populate(target, parsed, { override: true, debug: true })

console.log(target) // { HELLO: 'universe' }
options
Debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being populated as you expect.
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set.
‚ùì FAQ
Why is the .env file not loading my environment variables successfully?
Most likely your .env file is not in the correct place. See this stack overflow.
Turn on debug mode and try again..
require('dotenv').config({ debug: true })
You will receive a helpful error outputted to your console.
Should I commit my .env file?
No. We strongly recommend against committing your .env file to version
control. It should only include environment-specific values such as database
passwords or API keys. Your production database should have a different
password than your development database.
Should I have multiple .env files?
We recommend creating one .env file per environment. Use .env for local/development, .env.production for production and so on. This still follows the twelve factor principles as each is attributed individually to its own environment. Avoid custom set ups that work in inheritance somehow (.env.production inherits values form .env for example). It is better to duplicate values if necessary across each .env.environment file.

In a twelve-factor app, env vars are granular controls, each fully orthogonal to other env vars. They are never grouped together as ‚Äúenvironments‚Äù, but instead are independently managed for each deploy. This is a model that scales up smoothly as the app naturally expands into more deploys over its lifetime.
‚Äì The Twelve-Factor App

What rules does the parsing engine follow?
The parsing engine currently supports the following rules:

BASIC=basic becomes {BASIC: 'basic'}
empty lines are skipped
lines beginning with # are treated as comments
# marks the beginning of a comment (unless when the value is wrapped in quotes)
empty values become empty strings (EMPTY= becomes {EMPTY: ''})
inner quotes are maintained (think JSON) (JSON={"foo": "bar"} becomes {JSON:"{\"foo\": \"bar\"}")
whitespace is removed from both ends of unquoted values (see more on trim) (FOO=  some value   becomes {FOO: 'some value'})
single and double quoted values are escaped (SINGLE_QUOTE='quoted' becomes {SINGLE_QUOTE: "quoted"})
single and double quoted values maintain whitespace from both ends (FOO="  some value  " becomes {FOO: '  some value  '})
double quoted values expand new lines (MULTILINE="new\nline" becomes

{MULTILINE: 'new
line'}


backticks are supported (BACKTICK_KEY=`This has 'single' and "double" quotes inside of it.`)

What happens to environment variables that were already set?
By default, we will never modify any environment variables that have already been set. In particular, if there is a variable in your .env file which collides with one that already exists in your environment, then that variable will be skipped.
If instead, you want to override process.env use the override option.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
How come my environment variables are not showing up for React?
Your React code is run in Webpack, where the fs module or even the process global itself are not accessible out-of-the-box. process.env can only be injected through Webpack configuration.
If you are using react-scripts, which is distributed through create-react-app, it has dotenv built in but with a quirk. Preface your environment variables with REACT_APP_. See this stack overflow for more details.
If you are using other frameworks (e.g. Next.js, Gatsby...), you need to consult their documentation for how to inject environment variables into the client.
Can I customize/write plugins for dotenv?
Yes! dotenv.config() returns an object representing the parsed .env file. This gives you everything you need to continue setting values on process.env. For example:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const variableExpansion = require('dotenv-expand')
const myEnv = dotenv.config()
variableExpansion(myEnv)
How do I use dotenv with import?
Simply..
// index.mjs (ESM)
import 'dotenv/config' // see https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#how-do-i-use-dotenv-with-import
import express from 'express'
A little background..

When you run a module containing an import declaration, the modules it imports are loaded first, then each module body is executed in a depth-first traversal of the dependency graph, avoiding cycles by skipping anything already executed.
‚Äì ES6 In Depth: Modules

What does this mean in plain language? It means you would think the following would work but it won't.
errorReporter.mjs:
class Client {
  constructor (apiKey) {
    console.log('apiKey', apiKey)

    this.apiKey = apiKey
  }
}

export default new Client(process.env.API_KEY)
index.mjs:
// Note: this is INCORRECT and will not work
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv'
dotenv.config()

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs' // process.env.API_KEY will be blank!
process.env.API_KEY will be blank.
Instead, index.mjs should be written as..
import 'dotenv/config'

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs'
Does that make sense? It's a bit unintuitive, but it is how importing of ES6 modules work. Here is a working example of this pitfall.
There are two alternatives to this approach:

Preload dotenv: node --require dotenv/config index.js (Note: you do not need to import dotenv with this approach)
Create a separate file that will execute config first as outlined in this comment on #133

Why am I getting the error Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'crypto|os|path'?
You are using dotenv on the front-end and have not included a polyfill. Webpack < 5 used to include these for you. Do the following:
npm install node-polyfill-webpack-plugin
Configure your webpack.config.js to something like the following.
require('dotenv').config()

const path = require('path');
const webpack = require('webpack')

const NodePolyfillPlugin = require('node-polyfill-webpack-plugin')

module.exports = {
  mode: 'development',
  entry: './src/index.ts',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  plugins: [
    new NodePolyfillPlugin(),
    new webpack.DefinePlugin({
      'process.env': {
        HELLO: JSON.stringify(process.env.HELLO)
      }
    }),
  ]
};
Alternatively, just use dotenv-webpack which does this and more behind the scenes for you.
What about variable expansion?
Try dotenv-expand
What about syncing and securing .env files?
Use dotenvx
What if I accidentally commit my .env file to code?
Remove it, remove git history and then install the git pre-commit hook to prevent this from ever happening again.
brew install dotenvx/brew/dotenvx
dotenvx precommit --install

How can I prevent committing my .env file to a Docker build?
Use the docker prebuild hook.
# Dockerfile
...
RUN curl -fsS https://dotenvx.sh/ | sh
...
RUN dotenvx prebuild
CMD ["dotenvx", "run", "--", "node", "index.js"]

Who's using dotenv?
These npm modules depend on it.
Projects that expand it often use the keyword "dotenv" on npm.

üå± Install
npm install dotenv --save
You can also use an npm-compatible package manager like yarn or bun:
yarn add dotenv
# or
bun add dotenv
üèóÔ∏è Usage






Create a .env file in the root of your project (if using a monorepo structure like apps/backend/app.js, put it in the root of the folder where your app.js process runs):
S3_BUCKET="YOURS3BUCKET"
SECRET_KEY="YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE"
As early as possible in your application, import and configure dotenv:
require('dotenv').config()
console.log(process.env) // remove this after you've confirmed it is working
.. or using ES6?
import 'dotenv/config'
That's it. process.env now has the keys and values you defined in your .env file:
require('dotenv').config()
// or import 'dotenv/config' if you're using ES6

...

s3.getBucketCors({Bucket: process.env.S3_BUCKET}, function(err, data) {})
Multiline values
If you need multiline variables, for example private keys, those are now supported (>= v15.0.0) with line breaks:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
...
Kh9NV...
...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
Alternatively, you can double quote strings and use the \n character:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nKh9NV...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
Comments
Comments may be added to your file on their own line or inline:
# This is a comment
SECRET_KEY=YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE # comment
SECRET_HASH="something-with-a-#-hash"
Comments begin where a # exists, so if your value contains a # please wrap it in quotes. This is a breaking change from >= v15.0.0 and on.
Parsing
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Preload

Note: Consider using dotenvx instead of preloading. I am now doing (and recommending) so.
It serves the same purpose (you do not need to require and load dotenv), adds better debugging, and works with ANY language, framework, or platform. ‚Äì motdotla

You can use the --require (-r) command line option to preload dotenv. By doing this, you do not need to require and load dotenv in your application code.
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
The configuration options below are supported as command line arguments in the format dotenv_config_<option>=value
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env dotenv_config_debug=true
Additionally, you can use environment variables to set configuration options. Command line arguments will precede these.
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_<OPTION>=value node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_ENCODING=latin1 DOTENV_CONFIG_DEBUG=true node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env
Variable Expansion
You need to add the value of another variable in one of your variables? Use dotenv-expand.
Command Substitution
Use dotenvx to use command substitution.
Add the output of a command to one of your variables in your .env file.
# .env
DATABASE_URL="postgres://$(whoami)@localhost/my_database"
// index.js
console.log('DATABASE_URL', process.env.DATABASE_URL)
$ dotenvx run --debug -- node index.js
[dotenvx@0.14.1] injecting env (1) from .env
DATABASE_URL postgres://yourusername@localhost/my_database
Syncing
You need to keep .env files in sync between machines, environments, or team members? Use dotenvx to encrypt your .env files and safely include them in source control. This still subscribes to the twelve-factor app rules by generating a decryption key separate from code.
Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx to generate .env.ci, .env.production files, and more.
Deploying
You need to deploy your secrets in a cloud-agnostic manner? Use dotenvx to generate a private decryption key that is set on your production server.
üå¥ Manage Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx
Run any environment locally. Create a .env.ENVIRONMENT file and use --env-file to load it. It's straightforward, yet flexible.
$ echo "HELLO=production" > .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.production -- node index.js
Hello production
> ^^
or with multiple .env files
$ echo "HELLO=local" > .env.local
$ echo "HELLO=World" > .env
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.local --env-file=.env -- node index.js
Hello local
more environment examples
üöÄ Deploying
Use dotenvx.
Add encryption to your .env files with a single command. Pass the --encrypt flag.
$ dotenvx set HELLO Production --encrypt -f .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION="<.env.production private key>" dotenvx run -- node index.js
[dotenvx] injecting env (2) from .env.production
Hello Production

üìñ Documentation
Dotenv exposes four functions:

config
parse
populate
decrypt

Config
config will read your .env file, parse the contents, assign it to
process.env,
and return an Object with a parsed key containing the loaded content or an error key if it failed.
const result = dotenv.config()

if (result.error) {
  throw result.error
}

console.log(result.parsed)
You can additionally, pass options to config.
Options
path
Default: path.resolve(process.cwd(), '.env')
Specify a custom path if your file containing environment variables is located elsewhere.
require('dotenv').config({ path: '/custom/path/to/.env' })
By default, config will look for a file called .env in the current working directory.
Pass in multiple files as an array, and they will be parsed in order and combined with process.env (or option.processEnv, if set). The first value set for a variable will win, unless the options.override flag is set, in which case the last value set will win.  If a value already exists in process.env and the options.override flag is NOT set, no changes will be made to that value.
require('dotenv').config({ path: ['.env.local', '.env'] })
encoding
Default: utf8
Specify the encoding of your file containing environment variables.
require('dotenv').config({ encoding: 'latin1' })
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
require('dotenv').config({ debug: process.env.DEBUG })
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set on your machine with values from your .env file(s). If multiple files have been provided in option.path the override will also be used as each file is combined with the next. Without override being set, the first value wins. With override set the last value wins.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
processEnv
Default: process.env
Specify an object to write your environment variables to. Defaults to process.env environment variables.
const myObject = {}
require('dotenv').config({ processEnv: myObject })

console.log(myObject) // values from .env
console.log(process.env) // this was not changed or written to
Parse
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment
variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return
an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Options
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('hello world')
const opt = { debug: true }
const config = dotenv.parse(buf, opt)
// expect a debug message because the buffer is not in KEY=VAL form
Populate
The engine which populates the contents of your .env file to process.env is available for use. It accepts a target, a source, and options. This is useful for power users who want to supply their own objects.
For example, customizing the source:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'world' }

dotenv.populate(process.env, parsed)

console.log(process.env.HELLO) // world
For example, customizing the source AND target:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'universe' }
const target = { HELLO: 'world' } // empty object

dotenv.populate(target, parsed, { override: true, debug: true })

console.log(target) // { HELLO: 'universe' }
options
Debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being populated as you expect.
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set.
‚ùì FAQ
Why is the .env file not loading my environment variables successfully?
Most likely your .env file is not in the correct place. See this stack overflow.
Turn on debug mode and try again..
require('dotenv').config({ debug: true })
You will receive a helpful error outputted to your console.
Should I commit my .env file?
No. We strongly recommend against committing your .env file to version
control. It should only include environment-specific values such as database
passwords or API keys. Your production database should have a different
password than your development database.
Should I have multiple .env files?
We recommend creating one .env file per environment. Use .env for local/development, .env.production for production and so on. This still follows the twelve factor principles as each is attributed individually to its own environment. Avoid custom set ups that work in inheritance somehow (.env.production inherits values form .env for example). It is better to duplicate values if necessary across each .env.environment file.

In a twelve-factor app, env vars are granular controls, each fully orthogonal to other env vars. They are never grouped together as ‚Äúenvironments‚Äù, but instead are independently managed for each deploy. This is a model that scales up smoothly as the app naturally expands into more deploys over its lifetime.
‚Äì The Twelve-Factor App

What rules does the parsing engine follow?
The parsing engine currently supports the following rules:

BASIC=basic becomes {BASIC: 'basic'}
empty lines are skipped
lines beginning with # are treated as comments
# marks the beginning of a comment (unless when the value is wrapped in quotes)
empty values become empty strings (EMPTY= becomes {EMPTY: ''})
inner quotes are maintained (think JSON) (JSON={"foo": "bar"} becomes {JSON:"{\"foo\": \"bar\"}")
whitespace is removed from both ends of unquoted values (see more on trim) (FOO=  some value   becomes {FOO: 'some value'})
single and double quoted values are escaped (SINGLE_QUOTE='quoted' becomes {SINGLE_QUOTE: "quoted"})
single and double quoted values maintain whitespace from both ends (FOO="  some value  " becomes {FOO: '  some value  '})
double quoted values expand new lines (MULTILINE="new\nline" becomes

{MULTILINE: 'new
line'}


backticks are supported (BACKTICK_KEY=`This has 'single' and "double" quotes inside of it.`)

What happens to environment variables that were already set?
By default, we will never modify any environment variables that have already been set. In particular, if there is a variable in your .env file which collides with one that already exists in your environment, then that variable will be skipped.
If instead, you want to override process.env use the override option.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
How come my environment variables are not showing up for React?
Your React code is run in Webpack, where the fs module or even the process global itself are not accessible out-of-the-box. process.env can only be injected through Webpack configuration.
If you are using react-scripts, which is distributed through create-react-app, it has dotenv built in but with a quirk. Preface your environment variables with REACT_APP_. See this stack overflow for more details.
If you are using other frameworks (e.g. Next.js, Gatsby...), you need to consult their documentation for how to inject environment variables into the client.
Can I customize/write plugins for dotenv?
Yes! dotenv.config() returns an object representing the parsed .env file. This gives you everything you need to continue setting values on process.env. For example:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const variableExpansion = require('dotenv-expand')
const myEnv = dotenv.config()
variableExpansion(myEnv)
How do I use dotenv with import?
Simply..
// index.mjs (ESM)
import 'dotenv/config' // see https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#how-do-i-use-dotenv-with-import
import express from 'express'
A little background..

When you run a module containing an import declaration, the modules it imports are loaded first, then each module body is executed in a depth-first traversal of the dependency graph, avoiding cycles by skipping anything already executed.
‚Äì ES6 In Depth: Modules

What does this mean in plain language? It means you would think the following would work but it won't.
errorReporter.mjs:
class Client {
  constructor (apiKey) {
    console.log('apiKey', apiKey)

    this.apiKey = apiKey
  }
}

export default new Client(process.env.API_KEY)
index.mjs:
// Note: this is INCORRECT and will not work
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv'
dotenv.config()

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs' // process.env.API_KEY will be blank!
process.env.API_KEY will be blank.
Instead, index.mjs should be written as..
import 'dotenv/config'

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs'
Does that make sense? It's a bit unintuitive, but it is how importing of ES6 modules work. Here is a working example of this pitfall.
There are two alternatives to this approach:

Preload dotenv: node --require dotenv/config index.js (Note: you do not need to import dotenv with this approach)
Create a separate file that will execute config first as outlined in this comment on #133

Why am I getting the error Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'crypto|os|path'?
You are using dotenv on the front-end and have not included a polyfill. Webpack < 5 used to include these for you. Do the following:
npm install node-polyfill-webpack-plugin
Configure your webpack.config.js to something like the following.
require('dotenv').config()

const path = require('path');
const webpack = require('webpack')

const NodePolyfillPlugin = require('node-polyfill-webpack-plugin')

module.exports = {
  mode: 'development',
  entry: './src/index.ts',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  plugins: [
    new NodePolyfillPlugin(),
    new webpack.DefinePlugin({
      'process.env': {
        HELLO: JSON.stringify(process.env.HELLO)
      }
    }),
  ]
};
Alternatively, just use dotenv-webpack which does this and more behind the scenes for you.
What about variable expansion?
Try dotenv-expand
What about syncing and securing .env files?
Use dotenvx
What if I accidentally commit my .env file to code?
Remove it, remove git history and then install the git pre-commit hook to prevent this from ever happening again.
brew install dotenvx/brew/dotenvx
dotenvx precommit --install

How can I prevent committing my .env file to a Docker build?
Use the docker prebuild hook.
# Dockerfile
...
RUN curl -fsS https://dotenvx.sh/ | sh
...
RUN dotenvx prebuild
CMD ["dotenvx", "run", "--", "node", "index.js"]

You can also use an npm-compatible package manager like yarn or bun:
yarn add dotenv
# or

üèóÔ∏è Usage






Create a .env file in the root of your project (if using a monorepo structure like apps/backend/app.js, put it in the root of the folder where your app.js process runs):
S3_BUCKET="YOURS3BUCKET"
SECRET_KEY="YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE"
As early as possible in your application, import and configure dotenv:
require('dotenv').config()
console.log(process.env) // remove this after you've confirmed it is working
.. or using ES6?
import 'dotenv/config'
That's it. process.env now has the keys and values you defined in your .env file:
require('dotenv').config()
// or import 'dotenv/config' if you're using ES6

...

s3.getBucketCors({Bucket: process.env.S3_BUCKET}, function(err, data) {})
Multiline values
If you need multiline variables, for example private keys, those are now supported (>= v15.0.0) with line breaks:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
...
Kh9NV...
...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
Alternatively, you can double quote strings and use the \n character:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nKh9NV...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
Comments
Comments may be added to your file on their own line or inline:
# This is a comment
SECRET_KEY=YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE # comment
SECRET_HASH="something-with-a-#-hash"
Comments begin where a # exists, so if your value contains a # please wrap it in quotes. This is a breaking change from >= v15.0.0 and on.
Parsing
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Preload

Note: Consider using dotenvx instead of preloading. I am now doing (and recommending) so.
It serves the same purpose (you do not need to require and load dotenv), adds better debugging, and works with ANY language, framework, or platform. ‚Äì motdotla

$ DOTENV_CONFIG_ENCODING=latin1 DOTENV_CONFIG_DEBUG=true node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env
Variable Expansion

üìñ Documentation
Dotenv exposes four functions:

config
parse
populate
decrypt

Config
config will read your .env file, parse the contents, assign it to
process.env,
and return an Object with a parsed key containing the loaded content or an error key if it failed.
const result = dotenv.config()

if (result.error) {
  throw result.error
}

console.log(result.parsed)
You can additionally, pass options to config.
Options
path
Default: path.resolve(process.cwd(), '.env')
Specify a custom path if your file containing environment variables is located elsewhere.
require('dotenv').config({ path: '/custom/path/to/.env' })
By default, config will look for a file called .env in the current working directory.
Pass in multiple files as an array, and they will be parsed in order and combined with process.env (or option.processEnv, if set). The first value set for a variable will win, unless the options.override flag is set, in which case the last value set will win.  If a value already exists in process.env and the options.override flag is NOT set, no changes will be made to that value.
require('dotenv').config({ path: ['.env.local', '.env'] })
encoding
Default: utf8
Specify the encoding of your file containing environment variables.
require('dotenv').config({ encoding: 'latin1' })
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
require('dotenv').config({ debug: process.env.DEBUG })
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set on your machine with values from your .env file(s). If multiple files have been provided in option.path the override will also be used as each file is combined with the next. Without override being set, the first value wins. With override set the last value wins.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
processEnv
Default: process.env
Specify an object to write your environment variables to. Defaults to process.env environment variables.
const myObject = {}
require('dotenv').config({ processEnv: myObject })

console.log(myObject) // values from .env
console.log(process.env) // this was not changed or written to
Parse
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment
variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return
an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Options
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('hello world')
const opt = { debug: true }
const config = dotenv.parse(buf, opt)
// expect a debug message because the buffer is not in KEY=VAL form
Populate
The engine which populates the contents of your .env file to process.env is available for use. It accepts a target, a source, and options. This is useful for power users who want to supply their own objects.
For example, customizing the source:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'world' }

dotenv.populate(process.env, parsed)

console.log(process.env.HELLO) // world
For example, customizing the source AND target:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'universe' }
const target = { HELLO: 'world' } // empty object

dotenv.populate(target, parsed, { override: true, debug: true })

console.log(target) // { HELLO: 'universe' }
options
Debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being populated as you expect.
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set.
‚ùì FAQ
Why is the .env file not loading my environment variables successfully?
Most likely your .env file is not in the correct place. See this stack overflow.
Turn on debug mode and try again..
require('dotenv').config({ debug: true })
You will receive a helpful error outputted to your console.
Should I commit my .env file?
No. We strongly recommend against committing your .env file to version
control. It should only include environment-specific values such as database
passwords or API keys. Your production database should have a different
password than your development database.
Should I have multiple .env files?
We recommend creating one .env file per environment. Use .env for local/development, .env.production for production and so on. This still follows the twelve factor principles as each is attributed individually to its own environment. Avoid custom set ups that work in inheritance somehow (.env.production inherits values form .env for example). It is better to duplicate values if necessary across each .env.environment file.

In a twelve-factor app, env vars are granular controls, each fully orthogonal to other env vars. They are never grouped together as ‚Äúenvironments‚Äù, but instead are independently managed for each deploy. This is a model that scales up smoothly as the app naturally expands into more deploys over its lifetime.
‚Äì The Twelve-Factor App

What rules does the parsing engine follow?
The parsing engine currently supports the following rules:

BASIC=basic becomes {BASIC: 'basic'}
empty lines are skipped
lines beginning with # are treated as comments
# marks the beginning of a comment (unless when the value is wrapped in quotes)
empty values become empty strings (EMPTY= becomes {EMPTY: ''})
inner quotes are maintained (think JSON) (JSON={"foo": "bar"} becomes {JSON:"{\"foo\": \"bar\"}")
whitespace is removed from both ends of unquoted values (see more on trim) (FOO=  some value   becomes {FOO: 'some value'})
single and double quoted values are escaped (SINGLE_QUOTE='quoted' becomes {SINGLE_QUOTE: "quoted"})
single and double quoted values maintain whitespace from both ends (FOO="  some value  " becomes {FOO: '  some value  '})
double quoted values expand new lines (MULTILINE="new\nline" becomes

{MULTILINE: 'new
line'}


backticks are supported (BACKTICK_KEY=`This has 'single' and "double" quotes inside of it.`)

What happens to environment variables that were already set?
By default, we will never modify any environment variables that have already been set. In particular, if there is a variable in your .env file which collides with one that already exists in your environment, then that variable will be skipped.
If instead, you want to override process.env use the override option.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
How come my environment variables are not showing up for React?
Your React code is run in Webpack, where the fs module or even the process global itself are not accessible out-of-the-box. process.env can only be injected through Webpack configuration.
If you are using react-scripts, which is distributed through create-react-app, it has dotenv built in but with a quirk. Preface your environment variables with REACT_APP_. See this stack overflow for more details.
If you are using other frameworks (e.g. Next.js, Gatsby...), you need to consult their documentation for how to inject environment variables into the client.
Can I customize/write plugins for dotenv?
Yes! dotenv.config() returns an object representing the parsed .env file. This gives you everything you need to continue setting values on process.env. For example:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const variableExpansion = require('dotenv-expand')
const myEnv = dotenv.config()
variableExpansion(myEnv)
How do I use dotenv with import?
Simply..
// index.mjs (ESM)
import 'dotenv/config' // see https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#how-do-i-use-dotenv-with-import
import express from 'express'
A little background..

When you run a module containing an import declaration, the modules it imports are loaded first, then each module body is executed in a depth-first traversal of the dependency graph, avoiding cycles by skipping anything already executed.
‚Äì ES6 In Depth: Modules

What does this mean in plain language? It means you would think the following would work but it won't.
errorReporter.mjs:
class Client {
  constructor (apiKey) {
    console.log('apiKey', apiKey)

    this.apiKey = apiKey
  }
}

export default new Client(process.env.API_KEY)
index.mjs:
// Note: this is INCORRECT and will not work
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv'
dotenv.config()

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs' // process.env.API_KEY will be blank!
process.env.API_KEY will be blank.
Instead, index.mjs should be written as..
import 'dotenv/config'

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs'
Does that make sense? It's a bit unintuitive, but it is how importing of ES6 modules work. Here is a working example of this pitfall.
There are two alternatives to this approach:

Preload dotenv: node --require dotenv/config index.js (Note: you do not need to import dotenv with this approach)
Create a separate file that will execute config first as outlined in this comment on #133

Why am I getting the error Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'crypto|os|path'?
You are using dotenv on the front-end and have not included a polyfill. Webpack < 5 used to include these for you. Do the following:
npm install node-polyfill-webpack-plugin
Configure your webpack.config.js to something like the following.
require('dotenv').config()

const path = require('path');
const webpack = require('webpack')

const NodePolyfillPlugin = require('node-polyfill-webpack-plugin')

module.exports = {
  mode: 'development',
  entry: './src/index.ts',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  plugins: [
    new NodePolyfillPlugin(),
    new webpack.DefinePlugin({
      'process.env': {
        HELLO: JSON.stringify(process.env.HELLO)
      }
    }),
  ]
};
Alternatively, just use dotenv-webpack which does this and more behind the scenes for you.
What about variable expansion?
Try dotenv-expand
What about syncing and securing .env files?
Use dotenvx
What if I accidentally commit my .env file to code?
Remove it, remove git history and then install the git pre-commit hook to prevent this from ever happening again.
brew install dotenvx/brew/dotenvx
dotenvx precommit --install

How can I prevent committing my .env file to a Docker build?
Use the docker prebuild hook.
# Dockerfile
...
RUN curl -fsS https://dotenvx.sh/ | sh
...
RUN dotenvx prebuild
CMD ["dotenvx", "run", "--", "node", "index.js"]

dotenv 

Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology.

üå± Install
npm install dotenv --save
You can also use an npm-compatible package manager like yarn or bun:
yarn add dotenv
# or
bun add dotenv
üèóÔ∏è Usage






Create a .env file in the root of your project (if using a monorepo structure like apps/backend/app.js, put it in the root of the folder where your app.js process runs):
S3_BUCKET="YOURS3BUCKET"
SECRET_KEY="YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE"
As early as possible in your application, import and configure dotenv:
require('dotenv').config()
console.log(process.env) // remove this after you've confirmed it is working
.. or using ES6?
import 'dotenv/config'
That's it. process.env now has the keys and values you defined in your .env file:
require('dotenv').config()
// or import 'dotenv/config' if you're using ES6

...

s3.getBucketCors({Bucket: process.env.S3_BUCKET}, function(err, data) {})
Multiline values
If you need multiline variables, for example private keys, those are now supported (>= v15.0.0) with line breaks:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
...
Kh9NV...
...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
Alternatively, you can double quote strings and use the \n character:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nKh9NV...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
Comments
Comments may be added to your file on their own line or inline:
# This is a comment
SECRET_KEY=YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE # comment
SECRET_HASH="something-with-a-#-hash"
Comments begin where a # exists, so if your value contains a # please wrap it in quotes. This is a breaking change from >= v15.0.0 and on.
Parsing
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Preload

Note: Consider using dotenvx instead of preloading. I am now doing (and recommending) so.
It serves the same purpose (you do not need to require and load dotenv), adds better debugging, and works with ANY language, framework, or platform. ‚Äì motdotla

You can use the --require (-r) command line option to preload dotenv. By doing this, you do not need to require and load dotenv in your application code.
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
The configuration options below are supported as command line arguments in the format dotenv_config_<option>=value
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env dotenv_config_debug=true
Additionally, you can use environment variables to set configuration options. Command line arguments will precede these.
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_<OPTION>=value node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_ENCODING=latin1 DOTENV_CONFIG_DEBUG=true node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env
Variable Expansion
You need to add the value of another variable in one of your variables? Use dotenv-expand.
Command Substitution
Use dotenvx to use command substitution.
Add the output of a command to one of your variables in your .env file.
# .env
DATABASE_URL="postgres://$(whoami)@localhost/my_database"
// index.js
console.log('DATABASE_URL', process.env.DATABASE_URL)
$ dotenvx run --debug -- node index.js
[dotenvx@0.14.1] injecting env (1) from .env
DATABASE_URL postgres://yourusername@localhost/my_database
Syncing
You need to keep .env files in sync between machines, environments, or team members? Use dotenvx to encrypt your .env files and safely include them in source control. This still subscribes to the twelve-factor app rules by generating a decryption key separate from code.
Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx to generate .env.ci, .env.production files, and more.
Deploying
You need to deploy your secrets in a cloud-agnostic manner? Use dotenvx to generate a private decryption key that is set on your production server.
üå¥ Manage Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx
Run any environment locally. Create a .env.ENVIRONMENT file and use --env-file to load it. It's straightforward, yet flexible.
$ echo "HELLO=production" > .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.production -- node index.js
Hello production
> ^^
or with multiple .env files
$ echo "HELLO=local" > .env.local
$ echo "HELLO=World" > .env
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.local --env-file=.env -- node index.js
Hello local
more environment examples
üöÄ Deploying
Use dotenvx.
Add encryption to your .env files with a single command. Pass the --encrypt flag.
$ dotenvx set HELLO Production --encrypt -f .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION="<.env.production private key>" dotenvx run -- node index.js
[dotenvx] injecting env (2) from .env.production
Hello Production

Dotenv exposes four functions:

config
parse
populate
decrypt

Config
config will read your .env file, parse the contents, assign it to
process.env,
and return an Object with a parsed key containing the loaded content or an error key if it failed.
const result = dotenv.config()

if (result.error) {
  throw result.error
}

console.log(result.parsed)
You can additionally, pass options to config.
Options
path
Default: path.resolve(process.cwd(), '.env')
Specify a custom path if your file containing environment variables is located elsewhere.
require('dotenv').config({ path: '/custom/path/to/.env' })
By default, config will look for a file called .env in the current working directory.
Pass in multiple files as an array, and they will be parsed in order and combined with process.env (or option.processEnv, if set). The first value set for a variable will win, unless the options.override flag is set, in which case the last value set will win.  If a value already exists in process.env and the options.override flag is NOT set, no changes will be made to that value.
require('dotenv').config({ path: ['.env.local', '.env'] })
encoding
Default: utf8
Specify the encoding of your file containing environment variables.
require('dotenv').config({ encoding: 'latin1' })
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
require('dotenv').config({ debug: process.env.DEBUG })
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set on your machine with values from your .env file(s). If multiple files have been provided in option.path the override will also be used as each file is combined with the next. Without override being set, the first value wins. With override set the last value wins.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
processEnv
Default: process.env
Specify an object to write your environment variables to. Defaults to process.env environment variables.
const myObject = {}
require('dotenv').config({ processEnv: myObject })

console.log(myObject) // values from .env
console.log(process.env) // this was not changed or written to
Parse
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment
variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return
an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Options
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('hello world')
const opt = { debug: true }
const config = dotenv.parse(buf, opt)
// expect a debug message because the buffer is not in KEY=VAL form
Populate
The engine which populates the contents of your .env file to process.env is available for use. It accepts a target, a source, and options. This is useful for power users who want to supply their own objects.
For example, customizing the source:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'world' }

dotenv.populate(process.env, parsed)

console.log(process.env.HELLO) // world
For example, customizing the source AND target:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'universe' }
const target = { HELLO: 'world' } // empty object

dotenv.populate(target, parsed, { override: true, debug: true })

console.log(target) // { HELLO: 'universe' }
options
Debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being populated as you expect.
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set.

Most likely your .env file is not in the correct place. See this stack overflow.
Turn on debug mode and try again..
require('dotenv').config({ debug: true })
You will receive a helpful error outputted to your console.
Should I commit my .env file?
No. We strongly recommend against committing your .env file to version
control. It should only include environment-specific values such as database
passwords or API keys. Your production database should have a different
password than your development database.
Should I have multiple .env files?
We recommend creating one .env file per environment. Use .env for local/development, .env.production for production and so on. This still follows the twelve factor principles as each is attributed individually to its own environment. Avoid custom set ups that work in inheritance somehow (.env.production inherits values form .env for example). It is better to duplicate values if necessary across each .env.environment file.

In a twelve-factor app, env vars are granular controls, each fully orthogonal to other env vars. They are never grouped together as ‚Äúenvironments‚Äù, but instead are independently managed for each deploy. This is a model that scales up smoothly as the app naturally expands into more deploys over its lifetime.
‚Äì The Twelve-Factor App

What rules does the parsing engine follow?
The parsing engine currently supports the following rules:

BASIC=basic becomes {BASIC: 'basic'}
empty lines are skipped
lines beginning with # are treated as comments
# marks the beginning of a comment (unless when the value is wrapped in quotes)
empty values become empty strings (EMPTY= becomes {EMPTY: ''})
inner quotes are maintained (think JSON) (JSON={"foo": "bar"} becomes {JSON:"{\"foo\": \"bar\"}")
whitespace is removed from both ends of unquoted values (see more on trim) (FOO=  some value   becomes {FOO: 'some value'})
single and double quoted values are escaped (SINGLE_QUOTE='quoted' becomes {SINGLE_QUOTE: "quoted"})
single and double quoted values maintain whitespace from both ends (FOO="  some value  " becomes {FOO: '  some value  '})
double quoted values expand new lines (MULTILINE="new\nline" becomes

{MULTILINE: 'new
line'}


backticks are supported (BACKTICK_KEY=`This has 'single' and "double" quotes inside of it.`)

What happens to environment variables that were already set?
By default, we will never modify any environment variables that have already been set. In particular, if there is a variable in your .env file which collides with one that already exists in your environment, then that variable will be skipped.
If instead, you want to override process.env use the override option.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
How come my environment variables are not showing up for React?
Your React code is run in Webpack, where the fs module or even the process global itself are not accessible out-of-the-box. process.env can only be injected through Webpack configuration.
If you are using react-scripts, which is distributed through create-react-app, it has dotenv built in but with a quirk. Preface your environment variables with REACT_APP_. See this stack overflow for more details.
If you are using other frameworks (e.g. Next.js, Gatsby...), you need to consult their documentation for how to inject environment variables into the client.
Can I customize/write plugins for dotenv?
Yes! dotenv.config() returns an object representing the parsed .env file. This gives you everything you need to continue setting values on process.env. For example:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const variableExpansion = require('dotenv-expand')
const myEnv = dotenv.config()
variableExpansion(myEnv)
How do I use dotenv with import?
Simply..
// index.mjs (ESM)
import 'dotenv/config' // see https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#how-do-i-use-dotenv-with-import
import express from 'express'
A little background..

When you run a module containing an import declaration, the modules it imports are loaded first, then each module body is executed in a depth-first traversal of the dependency graph, avoiding cycles by skipping anything already executed.
‚Äì ES6 In Depth: Modules

What does this mean in plain language? It means you would think the following would work but it won't.
errorReporter.mjs:
class Client {
  constructor (apiKey) {
    console.log('apiKey', apiKey)

    this.apiKey = apiKey
  }
}

export default new Client(process.env.API_KEY)
index.mjs:
// Note: this is INCORRECT and will not work
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv'
dotenv.config()

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs' // process.env.API_KEY will be blank!
process.env.API_KEY will be blank.
Instead, index.mjs should be written as..
import 'dotenv/config'

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs'
Does that make sense? It's a bit unintuitive, but it is how importing of ES6 modules work. Here is a working example of this pitfall.
There are two alternatives to this approach:

Preload dotenv: node --require dotenv/config index.js (Note: you do not need to import dotenv with this approach)
Create a separate file that will execute config first as outlined in this comment on #133

Why am I getting the error Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'crypto|os|path'?
You are using dotenv on the front-end and have not included a polyfill. Webpack < 5 used to include these for you. Do the following:
npm install node-polyfill-webpack-plugin
Configure your webpack.config.js to something like the following.
require('dotenv').config()

const path = require('path');
const webpack = require('webpack')

const NodePolyfillPlugin = require('node-polyfill-webpack-plugin')

module.exports = {
  mode: 'development',
  entry: './src/index.ts',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  plugins: [
    new NodePolyfillPlugin(),
    new webpack.DefinePlugin({
      'process.env': {
        HELLO: JSON.stringify(process.env.HELLO)
      }
    }),
  ]
};
Alternatively, just use dotenv-webpack which does this and more behind the scenes for you.
What about variable expansion?
Try dotenv-expand
What about syncing and securing .env files?
Use dotenvx
What if I accidentally commit my .env file to code?
Remove it, remove git history and then install the git pre-commit hook to prevent this from ever happening again.
brew install dotenvx/brew/dotenvx
dotenvx precommit --install

How can I prevent committing my .env file to a Docker build?
Use the docker prebuild hook.
# Dockerfile
...
RUN curl -fsS https://dotenvx.sh/ | sh
...
RUN dotenvx prebuild
CMD ["dotenvx", "run", "--", "node", "index.js"]

dotenv 

Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology.

üå± Install
npm install dotenv --save
You can also use an npm-compatible package manager like yarn or bun:
yarn add dotenv
# or
bun add dotenv
üèóÔ∏è Usage






Create a .env file in the root of your project (if using a monorepo structure like apps/backend/app.js, put it in the root of the folder where your app.js process runs):
S3_BUCKET="YOURS3BUCKET"
SECRET_KEY="YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE"
As early as possible in your application, import and configure dotenv:
require('dotenv').config()
console.log(process.env) // remove this after you've confirmed it is working
.. or using ES6?
import 'dotenv/config'
That's it. process.env now has the keys and values you defined in your .env file:
require('dotenv').config()
// or import 'dotenv/config' if you're using ES6

...

s3.getBucketCors({Bucket: process.env.S3_BUCKET}, function(err, data) {})
Multiline values
If you need multiline variables, for example private keys, those are now supported (>= v15.0.0) with line breaks:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
...
Kh9NV...
...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
Alternatively, you can double quote strings and use the \n character:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nKh9NV...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
Comments
Comments may be added to your file on their own line or inline:
# This is a comment
SECRET_KEY=YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE # comment
SECRET_HASH="something-with-a-#-hash"
Comments begin where a # exists, so if your value contains a # please wrap it in quotes. This is a breaking change from >= v15.0.0 and on.
Parsing
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Preload

Note: Consider using dotenvx instead of preloading. I am now doing (and recommending) so.
It serves the same purpose (you do not need to require and load dotenv), adds better debugging, and works with ANY language, framework, or platform. ‚Äì motdotla

You can use the --require (-r) command line option to preload dotenv. By doing this, you do not need to require and load dotenv in your application code.
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
The configuration options below are supported as command line arguments in the format dotenv_config_<option>=value
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env dotenv_config_debug=true
Additionally, you can use environment variables to set configuration options. Command line arguments will precede these.
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_<OPTION>=value node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_ENCODING=latin1 DOTENV_CONFIG_DEBUG=true node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env
Variable Expansion
You need to add the value of another variable in one of your variables? Use dotenv-expand.
Command Substitution
Use dotenvx to use command substitution.
Add the output of a command to one of your variables in your .env file.
# .env
DATABASE_URL="postgres://$(whoami)@localhost/my_database"
// index.js
console.log('DATABASE_URL', process.env.DATABASE_URL)
$ dotenvx run --debug -- node index.js
[dotenvx@0.14.1] injecting env (1) from .env
DATABASE_URL postgres://yourusername@localhost/my_database
Syncing
You need to keep .env files in sync between machines, environments, or team members? Use dotenvx to encrypt your .env files and safely include them in source control. This still subscribes to the twelve-factor app rules by generating a decryption key separate from code.
Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx to generate .env.ci, .env.production files, and more.
Deploying
You need to deploy your secrets in a cloud-agnostic manner? Use dotenvx to generate a private decryption key that is set on your production server.
üå¥ Manage Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx
Run any environment locally. Create a .env.ENVIRONMENT file and use --env-file to load it. It's straightforward, yet flexible.
$ echo "HELLO=production" > .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.production -- node index.js
Hello production
> ^^
or with multiple .env files
$ echo "HELLO=local" > .env.local
$ echo "HELLO=World" > .env
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.local --env-file=.env -- node index.js
Hello local
more environment examples
üöÄ Deploying
Use dotenvx.
Add encryption to your .env files with a single command. Pass the --encrypt flag.
$ dotenvx set HELLO Production --encrypt -f .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION="<.env.production private key>" dotenvx run -- node index.js
[dotenvx] injecting env (2) from .env.production
Hello Production

üìñ Documentation
Dotenv exposes four functions:

config
parse
populate
decrypt

Config
config will read your .env file, parse the contents, assign it to
process.env,
and return an Object with a parsed key containing the loaded content or an error key if it failed.
const result = dotenv.config()

if (result.error) {
  throw result.error
}

console.log(result.parsed)
You can additionally, pass options to config.
Options
path
Default: path.resolve(process.cwd(), '.env')
Specify a custom path if your file containing environment variables is located elsewhere.
require('dotenv').config({ path: '/custom/path/to/.env' })
By default, config will look for a file called .env in the current working directory.
Pass in multiple files as an array, and they will be parsed in order and combined with process.env (or option.processEnv, if set). The first value set for a variable will win, unless the options.override flag is set, in which case the last value set will win.  If a value already exists in process.env and the options.override flag is NOT set, no changes will be made to that value.
require('dotenv').config({ path: ['.env.local', '.env'] })
encoding
Default: utf8
Specify the encoding of your file containing environment variables.
require('dotenv').config({ encoding: 'latin1' })
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
require('dotenv').config({ debug: process.env.DEBUG })
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set on your machine with values from your .env file(s). If multiple files have been provided in option.path the override will also be used as each file is combined with the next. Without override being set, the first value wins. With override set the last value wins.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
processEnv
Default: process.env
Specify an object to write your environment variables to. Defaults to process.env environment variables.
const myObject = {}
require('dotenv').config({ processEnv: myObject })

console.log(myObject) // values from .env
console.log(process.env) // this was not changed or written to
Parse
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment
variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return
an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Options
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('hello world')
const opt = { debug: true }
const config = dotenv.parse(buf, opt)
// expect a debug message because the buffer is not in KEY=VAL form
Populate
The engine which populates the contents of your .env file to process.env is available for use. It accepts a target, a source, and options. This is useful for power users who want to supply their own objects.
For example, customizing the source:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'world' }

dotenv.populate(process.env, parsed)

console.log(process.env.HELLO) // world
For example, customizing the source AND target:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'universe' }
const target = { HELLO: 'world' } // empty object

dotenv.populate(target, parsed, { override: true, debug: true })

console.log(target) // { HELLO: 'universe' }
options
Debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being populated as you expect.
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set.

‚Äì ES6 In Depth: Modules

What does this mean in plain language? It means you would think the following would work but it won't.
errorReporter.mjs:
class Client {
  constructor (apiKey) {
    console.log('apiKey', apiKey)

    this.apiKey = apiKey

export default new Client(process.env.API_KEY)
index.mjs:
// Note: this is INCORRECT and will not work
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv'
dotenv.config()

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs' // process.env.API_KEY will be blank!
process.env.API_KEY will be blank.
Instead, index.mjs should be written as..
import 'dotenv/config'

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs'
Does that make sense? It's a bit unintuitive, but it is how importing of ES6 modules work. Here is a working example of this pitfall.
There are two alternatives to this approach:

Preload dotenv: node --require dotenv/config index.js (Note: you do not need to import dotenv with this approach)
Create a separate file that will execute config first as outlined in this comment on #133

Why am I getting the error Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'crypto|os|path'?
You are using dotenv on the front-end and have not included a polyfill. Webpack < 5 used to include these for you. Do the following:
npm install node-polyfill-webpack-plugin
Configure your webpack.config.js to something like the following.
require('dotenv').config()

const path = require('path');
const webpack = require('webpack')

const NodePolyfillPlugin = require('node-polyfill-webpack-plugin')

module.exports = {
  mode: 'development',
  entry: './src/index.ts',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  plugins: [
    new NodePolyfillPlugin(),
    new webpack.DefinePlugin({
      'process.env': {
        HELLO: JSON.stringify(process.env.HELLO)
      }
    }),
  ]
};
Alternatively, just use dotenv-webpack which does this and more behind the scenes for you.
What about variable expansion?
Try dotenv-expand
What about syncing and securing .env files?
Use dotenvx
What if I accidentally commit my .env file to code?
Remove it, remove git history and then install the git pre-commit hook to prevent this from ever happening again.
brew install dotenvx/brew/dotenvx
dotenvx precommit --install

How can I prevent committing my .env file to a Docker build?
Use the docker prebuild hook.
# Dockerfile
...
RUN curl -fsS https://dotenvx.sh/ | sh
...
RUN dotenvx prebuild
CMD ["dotenvx", "run", "--", "node", "index.js"]

dotenv 

Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology.

üå± Install
npm install dotenv --save
You can also use an npm-compatible package manager like yarn or bun:
yarn add dotenv
# or
bun add dotenv
üèóÔ∏è Usage






Create a .env file in the root of your project (if using a monorepo structure like apps/backend/app.js, put it in the root of the folder where your app.js process runs):
S3_BUCKET="YOURS3BUCKET"
SECRET_KEY="YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE"
As early as possible in your application, import and configure dotenv:
require('dotenv').config()
console.log(process.env) // remove this after you've confirmed it is working
.. or using ES6?
import 'dotenv/config'
That's it. process.env now has the keys and values you defined in your .env file:
require('dotenv').config()
// or import 'dotenv/config' if you're using ES6

...

s3.getBucketCors({Bucket: process.env.S3_BUCKET}, function(err, data) {})
Multiline values
If you need multiline variables, for example private keys, those are now supported (>= v15.0.0) with line breaks:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
...
Kh9NV...
...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
Alternatively, you can double quote strings and use the \n character:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nKh9NV...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
Comments
Comments may be added to your file on their own line or inline:
# This is a comment
SECRET_KEY=YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE # comment
SECRET_HASH="something-with-a-#-hash"
Comments begin where a # exists, so if your value contains a # please wrap it in quotes. This is a breaking change from >= v15.0.0 and on.
Parsing
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Preload

Note: Consider using dotenvx instead of preloading. I am now doing (and recommending) so.
It serves the same purpose (you do not need to require and load dotenv), adds better debugging, and works with ANY language, framework, or platform. ‚Äì motdotla

You can use the --require (-r) command line option to preload dotenv. By doing this, you do not need to require and load dotenv in your application code.
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
The configuration options below are supported as command line arguments in the format dotenv_config_<option>=value
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env dotenv_config_debug=true
Additionally, you can use environment variables to set configuration options. Command line arguments will precede these.
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_<OPTION>=value node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_ENCODING=latin1 DOTENV_CONFIG_DEBUG=true node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env
Variable Expansion
You need to add the value of another variable in one of your variables? Use dotenv-expand.
Command Substitution
Use dotenvx to use command substitution.
Add the output of a command to one of your variables in your .env file.
# .env
DATABASE_URL="postgres://$(whoami)@localhost/my_database"
// index.js
console.log('DATABASE_URL', process.env.DATABASE_URL)
$ dotenvx run --debug -- node index.js
[dotenvx@0.14.1] injecting env (1) from .env
DATABASE_URL postgres://yourusername@localhost/my_database
Syncing
You need to keep .env files in sync between machines, environments, or team members? Use dotenvx to encrypt your .env files and safely include them in source control. This still subscribes to the twelve-factor app rules by generating a decryption key separate from code.
Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx to generate .env.ci, .env.production files, and more.
Deploying
You need to deploy your secrets in a cloud-agnostic manner? Use dotenvx to generate a private decryption key that is set on your production server.
üå¥ Manage Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx
Run any environment locally. Create a .env.ENVIRONMENT file and use --env-file to load it. It's straightforward, yet flexible.
$ echo "HELLO=production" > .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.production -- node index.js
Hello production
> ^^
or with multiple .env files
$ echo "HELLO=local" > .env.local
$ echo "HELLO=World" > .env
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.local --env-file=.env -- node index.js
Hello local
more environment examples
üöÄ Deploying
Use dotenvx.
Add encryption to your .env files with a single command. Pass the --encrypt flag.
$ dotenvx set HELLO Production --encrypt -f .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION="<.env.production private key>" dotenvx run -- node index.js
[dotenvx] injecting env (2) from .env.production
Hello Production

üìñ Documentation
Dotenv exposes four functions:

config
parse
populate
decrypt

Config
config will read your .env file, parse the contents, assign it to
process.env,
and return an Object with a parsed key containing the loaded content or an error key if it failed.
const result = dotenv.config()

if (result.error) {
  throw result.error
}

console.log(result.parsed)
You can additionally, pass options to config.
Options
path
Default: path.resolve(process.cwd(), '.env')
Specify a custom path if your file containing environment variables is located elsewhere.
require('dotenv').config({ path: '/custom/path/to/.env' })
By default, config will look for a file called .env in the current working directory.
Pass in multiple files as an array, and they will be parsed in order and combined with process.env (or option.processEnv, if set). The first value set for a variable will win, unless the options.override flag is set, in which case the last value set will win.  If a value already exists in process.env and the options.override flag is NOT set, no changes will be made to that value.
require('dotenv').config({ path: ['.env.local', '.env'] })
encoding
Default: utf8
Specify the encoding of your file containing environment variables.
require('dotenv').config({ encoding: 'latin1' })
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
require('dotenv').config({ debug: process.env.DEBUG })
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set on your machine with values from your .env file(s). If multiple files have been provided in option.path the override will also be used as each file is combined with the next. Without override being set, the first value wins. With override set the last value wins.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
processEnv
Default: process.env
Specify an object to write your environment variables to. Defaults to process.env environment variables.
const myObject = {}
require('dotenv').config({ processEnv: myObject })

console.log(myObject) // values from .env
console.log(process.env) // this was not changed or written to
Parse
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment
variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return
an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Options
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('hello world')
const opt = { debug: true }
const config = dotenv.parse(buf, opt)
// expect a debug message because the buffer is not in KEY=VAL form
Populate
The engine which populates the contents of your .env file to process.env is available for use. It accepts a target, a source, and options. This is useful for power users who want to supply their own objects.
For example, customizing the source:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'world' }

dotenv.populate(process.env, parsed)

console.log(process.env.HELLO) // world
For example, customizing the source AND target:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'universe' }
const target = { HELLO: 'world' } // empty object

dotenv.populate(target, parsed, { override: true, debug: true })

console.log(target) // { HELLO: 'universe' }
options
Debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being populated as you expect.
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set.
‚ùì FAQ
Why is the .env file not loading my environment variables successfully?
Most likely your .env file is not in the correct place. See this stack overflow.
Turn on debug mode and try again..
require('dotenv').config({ debug: true })
You will receive a helpful error outputted to your console.
Should I commit my .env file?
No. We strongly recommend against committing your .env file to version
control. It should only include environment-specific values such as database
passwords or API keys. Your production database should have a different
password than your development database.
Should I have multiple .env files?
We recommend creating one .env file per environment. Use .env for local/development, .env.production for production and so on. This still follows the twelve factor principles as each is attributed individually to its own environment. Avoid custom set ups that work in inheritance somehow (.env.production inherits values form .env for example). It is better to duplicate values if necessary across each .env.environment file.

In a twelve-factor app, env vars are granular controls, each fully orthogonal to other env vars. They are never grouped together as ‚Äúenvironments‚Äù, but instead are independently managed for each deploy. This is a model that scales up smoothly as the app naturally expands into more deploys over its lifetime.
‚Äì The Twelve-Factor App

What rules does the parsing engine follow?
The parsing engine currently supports the following rules:

BASIC=basic becomes {BASIC: 'basic'}
empty lines are skipped
lines beginning with # are treated as comments
# marks the beginning of a comment (unless when the value is wrapped in quotes)
empty values become empty strings (EMPTY= becomes {EMPTY: ''})
inner quotes are maintained (think JSON) (JSON={"foo": "bar"} becomes {JSON:"{\"foo\": \"bar\"}")
whitespace is removed from both ends of unquoted values (see more on trim) (FOO=  some value   becomes {FOO: 'some value'})
single and double quoted values are escaped (SINGLE_QUOTE='quoted' becomes {SINGLE_QUOTE: "quoted"})
single and double quoted values maintain whitespace from both ends (FOO="  some value  " becomes {FOO: '  some value  '})
double quoted values expand new lines (MULTILINE="new\nline" becomes

{MULTILINE: 'new
line'}


backticks are supported (BACKTICK_KEY=`This has 'single' and "double" quotes inside of it.`)

What happens to environment variables that were already set?
By default, we will never modify any environment variables that have already been set. In particular, if there is a variable in your .env file which collides with one that already exists in your environment, then that variable will be skipped.
If instead, you want to override process.env use the override option.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
How come my environment variables are not showing up for React?
Your React code is run in Webpack, where the fs module or even the process global itself are not accessible out-of-the-box. process.env can only be injected through Webpack configuration.
If you are using react-scripts, which is distributed through create-react-app, it has dotenv built in but with a quirk. Preface your environment variables with REACT_APP_. See this stack overflow for more details.
If you are using other frameworks (e.g. Next.js, Gatsby...), you need to consult their documentation for how to inject environment variables into the client.
Can I customize/write plugins for dotenv?
Yes! dotenv.config() returns an object representing the parsed .env file. This gives you everything you need to continue setting values on process.env. For example:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const variableExpansion = require('dotenv-expand')
const myEnv = dotenv.config()
variableExpansion(myEnv)
How do I use dotenv with import?
Simply..
// index.mjs (ESM)
import 'dotenv/config' // see https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#how-do-i-use-dotenv-with-import
import express from 'express'
A little background..

When you run a module containing an import declaration, the modules it imports are loaded first, then each module body is executed in a depth-first traversal of the dependency graph, avoiding cycles by skipping anything already executed.
‚Äì ES6 In Depth: Modules

What does this mean in plain language? It means you would think the following would work but it won't.
errorReporter.mjs:
class Client {
  constructor (apiKey) {
    console.log('apiKey', apiKey)

    this.apiKey = apiKey
  }
}

export default new Client(process.env.API_KEY)
index.mjs:
// Note: this is INCORRECT and will not work
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv'
dotenv.config()

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs' // process.env.API_KEY will be blank!
process.env.API_KEY will be blank.
Instead, index.mjs should be written as..
import 'dotenv/config'

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs'
Does that make sense? It's a bit unintuitive, but it is how importing of ES6 modules work. Here is a working example of this pitfall.
There are two alternatives to this approach:

Preload dotenv: node --require dotenv/config index.js (Note: you do not need to import dotenv with this approach)
Create a separate file that will execute config first as outlined in this comment on #133

Why am I getting the error Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'crypto|os|path'?
You are using dotenv on the front-end and have not included a polyfill. Webpack < 5 used to include these for you. Do the following:
npm install node-polyfill-webpack-plugin
Configure your webpack.config.js to something like the following.
require('dotenv').config()

const path = require('path');
const webpack = require('webpack')

const NodePolyfillPlugin = require('node-polyfill-webpack-plugin')

module.exports = {
  mode: 'development',
  entry: './src/index.ts',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  plugins: [
    new NodePolyfillPlugin(),
    new webpack.DefinePlugin({
      'process.env': {
        HELLO: JSON.stringify(process.env.HELLO)
      }
    }),
  ]
};
Alternatively, just use dotenv-webpack which does this and more behind the scenes for you.
What about variable expansion?
Try dotenv-expand
What about syncing and securing .env files?
Use dotenvx
What if I accidentally commit my .env file to code?
Remove it, remove git history and then install the git pre-commit hook to prevent this from ever happening again.
brew install dotenvx/brew/dotenvx
dotenvx precommit --install

How can I prevent committing my .env file to a Docker build?

dotenv 

Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology.

üå± Install
npm install dotenv --save
You can also use an npm-compatible package manager like yarn or bun:
yarn add dotenv
# or
bun add dotenv
üèóÔ∏è Usage






Create a .env file in the root of your project (if using a monorepo structure like apps/backend/app.js, put it in the root of the folder where your app.js process runs):
S3_BUCKET="YOURS3BUCKET"
SECRET_KEY="YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE"
As early as possible in your application, import and configure dotenv:
require('dotenv').config()
console.log(process.env) // remove this after you've confirmed it is working
.. or using ES6?
import 'dotenv/config'
That's it. process.env now has the keys and values you defined in your .env file:
require('dotenv').config()
// or import 'dotenv/config' if you're using ES6

...

s3.getBucketCors({Bucket: process.env.S3_BUCKET}, function(err, data) {})
Multiline values
If you need multiline variables, for example private keys, those are now supported (>= v15.0.0) with line breaks:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
...
Kh9NV...
...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
Alternatively, you can double quote strings and use the \n character:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nKh9NV...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
Comments
Comments may be added to your file on their own line or inline:
# This is a comment
SECRET_KEY=YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE # comment
SECRET_HASH="something-with-a-#-hash"
Comments begin where a # exists, so if your value contains a # please wrap it in quotes. This is a breaking change from >= v15.0.0 and on.
Parsing
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Preload

Note: Consider using dotenvx instead of preloading. I am now doing (and recommending) so.
It serves the same purpose (you do not need to require and load dotenv), adds better debugging, and works with ANY language, framework, or platform. ‚Äì motdotla

You can use the --require (-r) command line option to preload dotenv. By doing this, you do not need to require and load dotenv in your application code.
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
The configuration options below are supported as command line arguments in the format dotenv_config_<option>=value
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env dotenv_config_debug=true
Additionally, you can use environment variables to set configuration options. Command line arguments will precede these.
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_<OPTION>=value node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_ENCODING=latin1 DOTENV_CONFIG_DEBUG=true node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env
Variable Expansion
You need to add the value of another variable in one of your variables? Use dotenv-expand.
Command Substitution
Use dotenvx to use command substitution.
Add the output of a command to one of your variables in your .env file.
# .env
DATABASE_URL="postgres://$(whoami)@localhost/my_database"
// index.js
console.log('DATABASE_URL', process.env.DATABASE_URL)
$ dotenvx run --debug -- node index.js
[dotenvx@0.14.1] injecting env (1) from .env
DATABASE_URL postgres://yourusername@localhost/my_database
Syncing
You need to keep .env files in sync between machines, environments, or team members? Use dotenvx to encrypt your .env files and safely include them in source control. This still subscribes to the twelve-factor app rules by generating a decryption key separate from code.
Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx to generate .env.ci, .env.production files, and more.
Deploying
You need to deploy your secrets in a cloud-agnostic manner? Use dotenvx to generate a private decryption key that is set on your production server.
üå¥ Manage Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx
Run any environment locally. Create a .env.ENVIRONMENT file and use --env-file to load it. It's straightforward, yet flexible.
$ echo "HELLO=production" > .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.production -- node index.js
Hello production
> ^^
or with multiple .env files
$ echo "HELLO=local" > .env.local
$ echo "HELLO=World" > .env
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.local --env-file=.env -- node index.js
Hello local
more environment examples
üöÄ Deploying
Use dotenvx.
Add encryption to your .env files with a single command. Pass the --encrypt flag.
$ dotenvx set HELLO Production --encrypt -f .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION="<.env.production private key>" dotenvx run -- node index.js
[dotenvx] injecting env (2) from .env.production
Hello Production

üìñ Documentation
Dotenv exposes four functions:

config
parse
populate
decrypt

Config
config will read your .env file, parse the contents, assign it to
process.env,
and return an Object with a parsed key containing the loaded content or an error key if it failed.
const result = dotenv.config()

if (result.error) {
  throw result.error
}

console.log(result.parsed)
You can additionally, pass options to config.
Options
path
Default: path.resolve(process.cwd(), '.env')
Specify a custom path if your file containing environment variables is located elsewhere.
require('dotenv').config({ path: '/custom/path/to/.env' })
By default, config will look for a file called .env in the current working directory.
Pass in multiple files as an array, and they will be parsed in order and combined with process.env (or option.processEnv, if set). The first value set for a variable will win, unless the options.override flag is set, in which case the last value set will win.  If a value already exists in process.env and the options.override flag is NOT set, no changes will be made to that value.
require('dotenv').config({ path: ['.env.local', '.env'] })
encoding
Default: utf8
Specify the encoding of your file containing environment variables.
require('dotenv').config({ encoding: 'latin1' })
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
require('dotenv').config({ debug: process.env.DEBUG })
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set on your machine with values from your .env file(s). If multiple files have been provided in option.path the override will also be used as each file is combined with the next. Without override being set, the first value wins. With override set the last value wins.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
processEnv
Default: process.env
Specify an object to write your environment variables to. Defaults to process.env environment variables.
const myObject = {}
require('dotenv').config({ processEnv: myObject })

console.log(myObject) // values from .env
console.log(process.env) // this was not changed or written to
Parse
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment
variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return
an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Options
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('hello world')
const opt = { debug: true }
const config = dotenv.parse(buf, opt)
// expect a debug message because the buffer is not in KEY=VAL form
Populate
The engine which populates the contents of your .env file to process.env is available for use. It accepts a target, a source, and options. This is useful for power users who want to supply their own objects.
For example, customizing the source:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'world' }

dotenv.populate(process.env, parsed)

console.log(process.env.HELLO) // world
For example, customizing the source AND target:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'universe' }
const target = { HELLO: 'world' } // empty object

dotenv.populate(target, parsed, { override: true, debug: true })

console.log(target) // { HELLO: 'universe' }
options
Debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being populated as you expect.
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set.
‚ùì FAQ
Why is the .env file not loading my environment variables successfully?
Most likely your .env file is not in the correct place. See this stack overflow.
Turn on debug mode and try again..
require('dotenv').config({ debug: true })
You will receive a helpful error outputted to your console.
Should I commit my .env file?
No. We strongly recommend against committing your .env file to version
control. It should only include environment-specific values such as database
passwords or API keys. Your production database should have a different
password than your development database.
Should I have multiple .env files?
We recommend creating one .env file per environment. Use .env for local/development, .env.production for production and so on. This still follows the twelve factor principles as each is attributed individually to its own environment. Avoid custom set ups that work in inheritance somehow (.env.production inherits values form .env for example). It is better to duplicate values if necessary across each .env.environment file.

In a twelve-factor app, env vars are granular controls, each fully orthogonal to other env vars. They are never grouped together as ‚Äúenvironments‚Äù, but instead are independently managed for each deploy. This is a model that scales up smoothly as the app naturally expands into more deploys over its lifetime.
‚Äì The Twelve-Factor App

What rules does the parsing engine follow?
The parsing engine currently supports the following rules:

BASIC=basic becomes {BASIC: 'basic'}
empty lines are skipped
lines beginning with # are treated as comments
# marks the beginning of a comment (unless when the value is wrapped in quotes)
empty values become empty strings (EMPTY= becomes {EMPTY: ''})
inner quotes are maintained (think JSON) (JSON={"foo": "bar"} becomes {JSON:"{\"foo\": \"bar\"}")
whitespace is removed from both ends of unquoted values (see more on trim) (FOO=  some value   becomes {FOO: 'some value'})
single and double quoted values are escaped (SINGLE_QUOTE='quoted' becomes {SINGLE_QUOTE: "quoted"})
single and double quoted values maintain whitespace from both ends (FOO="  some value  " becomes {FOO: '  some value  '})
double quoted values expand new lines (MULTILINE="new\nline" becomes

{MULTILINE: 'new
line'}


backticks are supported (BACKTICK_KEY=`This has 'single' and "double" quotes inside of it.`)

What happens to environment variables that were already set?
By default, we will never modify any environment variables that have already been set. In particular, if there is a variable in your .env file which collides with one that already exists in your environment, then that variable will be skipped.
If instead, you want to override process.env use the override option.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
How come my environment variables are not showing up for React?
Your React code is run in Webpack, where the fs module or even the process global itself are not accessible out-of-the-box. process.env can only be injected through Webpack configuration.
If you are using react-scripts, which is distributed through create-react-app, it has dotenv built in but with a quirk. Preface your environment variables with REACT_APP_. See this stack overflow for more details.
If you are using other frameworks (e.g. Next.js, Gatsby...), you need to consult their documentation for how to inject environment variables into the client.
Can I customize/write plugins for dotenv?
Yes! dotenv.config() returns an object representing the parsed .env file. This gives you everything you need to continue setting values on process.env. For example:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const variableExpansion = require('dotenv-expand')
const myEnv = dotenv.config()
variableExpansion(myEnv)
How do I use dotenv with import?
Simply..
// index.mjs (ESM)
import 'dotenv/config' // see https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#how-do-i-use-dotenv-with-import
import express from 'express'
A little background..

When you run a module containing an import declaration, the modules it imports are loaded first, then each module body is executed in a depth-first traversal of the dependency graph, avoiding cycles by skipping anything already executed.
‚Äì ES6 In Depth: Modules

What does this mean in plain language? It means you would think the following would work but it won't.
errorReporter.mjs:
class Client {
  constructor (apiKey) {
    console.log('apiKey', apiKey)

    this.apiKey = apiKey
  }
}

export default new Client(process.env.API_KEY)
index.mjs:
// Note: this is INCORRECT and will not work
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv'
dotenv.config()

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs' // process.env.API_KEY will be blank!
process.env.API_KEY will be blank.
Instead, index.mjs should be written as..
import 'dotenv/config'

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs'
Does that make sense? It's a bit unintuitive, but it is how importing of ES6 modules work. Here is a working example of this pitfall.
There are two alternatives to this approach:

Preload dotenv: node --require dotenv/config index.js (Note: you do not need to import dotenv with this approach)
Create a separate file that will execute config first as outlined in this comment on #133

Why am I getting the error Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'crypto|os|path'?
You are using dotenv on the front-end and have not included a polyfill. Webpack < 5 used to include these for you. Do the following:
npm install node-polyfill-webpack-plugin
Configure your webpack.config.js to something like the following.
require('dotenv').config()

const path = require('path');
const webpack = require('webpack')

const NodePolyfillPlugin = require('node-polyfill-webpack-plugin')

module.exports = {
  mode: 'development',
  entry: './src/index.ts',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  plugins: [
    new NodePolyfillPlugin(),
    new webpack.DefinePlugin({
      'process.env': {
        HELLO: JSON.stringify(process.env.HELLO)
      }
    }),
  ]
};
Alternatively, just use dotenv-webpack which does this and more behind the scenes for you.
What about variable expansion?
Try dotenv-expand
What about syncing and securing .env files?
Use dotenvx
What if I accidentally commit my .env file to code?
Remove it, remove git history and then install the git pre-commit hook to prevent this from ever happening again.
brew install dotenvx/brew/dotenvx
dotenvx precommit --install

How can I prevent committing my .env file to a Docker build?
Use the docker prebuild hook.
# Dockerfile
...
RUN curl -fsS https://dotenvx.sh/ | sh
...
RUN dotenvx prebuild
CMD ["dotenvx", "run", "--", "node", "index.js"]

Who's using dotenv?
These npm modules depend on it.
Projects that expand it often use the keyword "dotenv" on npm.

dotenv 

Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology.

üå± Install
npm install dotenv --save
You can also use an npm-compatible package manager like yarn or bun:
yarn add dotenv
# or
bun add dotenv
üèóÔ∏è Usage






Create a .env file in the root of your project (if using a monorepo structure like apps/backend/app.js, put it in the root of the folder where your app.js process runs):
S3_BUCKET="YOURS3BUCKET"
SECRET_KEY="YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE"
As early as possible in your application, import and configure dotenv:
require('dotenv').config()
console.log(process.env) // remove this after you've confirmed it is working
.. or using ES6?
import 'dotenv/config'
That's it. process.env now has the keys and values you defined in your .env file:
require('dotenv').config()
// or import 'dotenv/config' if you're using ES6

...

s3.getBucketCors({Bucket: process.env.S3_BUCKET}, function(err, data) {})
Multiline values
If you need multiline variables, for example private keys, those are now supported (>= v15.0.0) with line breaks:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
...
Kh9NV...
...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
Alternatively, you can double quote strings and use the \n character:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nKh9NV...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
Comments
Comments may be added to your file on their own line or inline:
# This is a comment
SECRET_KEY=YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE # comment
SECRET_HASH="something-with-a-#-hash"
Comments begin where a # exists, so if your value contains a # please wrap it in quotes. This is a breaking change from >= v15.0.0 and on.
Parsing
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Preload

Note: Consider using dotenvx instead of preloading. I am now doing (and recommending) so.
It serves the same purpose (you do not need to require and load dotenv), adds better debugging, and works with ANY language, framework, or platform. ‚Äì motdotla

You can use the --require (-r) command line option to preload dotenv. By doing this, you do not need to require and load dotenv in your application code.
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
The configuration options below are supported as command line arguments in the format dotenv_config_<option>=value
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env dotenv_config_debug=true
Additionally, you can use environment variables to set configuration options. Command line arguments will precede these.
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_<OPTION>=value node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_ENCODING=latin1 DOTENV_CONFIG_DEBUG=true node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env
Variable Expansion
You need to add the value of another variable in one of your variables? Use dotenv-expand.
Command Substitution
Use dotenvx to use command substitution.
Add the output of a command to one of your variables in your .env file.
# .env
DATABASE_URL="postgres://$(whoami)@localhost/my_database"
// index.js
console.log('DATABASE_URL', process.env.DATABASE_URL)
$ dotenvx run --debug -- node index.js
[dotenvx@0.14.1] injecting env (1) from .env
DATABASE_URL postgres://yourusername@localhost/my_database
Syncing
You need to keep .env files in sync between machines, environments, or team members? Use dotenvx to encrypt your .env files and safely include them in source control. This still subscribes to the twelve-factor app rules by generating a decryption key separate from code.
Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx to generate .env.ci, .env.production files, and more.
Deploying
You need to deploy your secrets in a cloud-agnostic manner? Use dotenvx to generate a private decryption key that is set on your production server.
üå¥ Manage Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx
Run any environment locally. Create a .env.ENVIRONMENT file and use --env-file to load it. It's straightforward, yet flexible.
$ echo "HELLO=production" > .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.production -- node index.js
Hello production
> ^^
or with multiple .env files
$ echo "HELLO=local" > .env.local
$ echo "HELLO=World" > .env
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.local --env-file=.env -- node index.js
Hello local
more environment examples
üöÄ Deploying
Use dotenvx.
Add encryption to your .env files with a single command. Pass the --encrypt flag.
$ dotenvx set HELLO Production --encrypt -f .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION="<.env.production private key>" dotenvx run -- node index.js
[dotenvx] injecting env (2) from .env.production
Hello Production

üìñ Documentation
Dotenv exposes four functions:

config
parse
populate
decrypt

Config
config will read your .env file, parse the contents, assign it to
process.env,
and return an Object with a parsed key containing the loaded content or an error key if it failed.
const result = dotenv.config()

if (result.error) {
  throw result.error
}

console.log(result.parsed)
You can additionally, pass options to config.
Options
path
Default: path.resolve(process.cwd(), '.env')
Specify a custom path if your file containing environment variables is located elsewhere.
require('dotenv').config({ path: '/custom/path/to/.env' })
By default, config will look for a file called .env in the current working directory.
Pass in multiple files as an array, and they will be parsed in order and combined with process.env (or option.processEnv, if set). The first value set for a variable will win, unless the options.override flag is set, in which case the last value set will win.  If a value already exists in process.env and the options.override flag is NOT set, no changes will be made to that value.
require('dotenv').config({ path: ['.env.local', '.env'] })
encoding
Default: utf8
Specify the encoding of your file containing environment variables.
require('dotenv').config({ encoding: 'latin1' })
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
require('dotenv').config({ debug: process.env.DEBUG })
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set on your machine with values from your .env file(s). If multiple files have been provided in option.path the override will also be used as each file is combined with the next. Without override being set, the first value wins. With override set the last value wins.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
processEnv
Default: process.env
Specify an object to write your environment variables to. Defaults to process.env environment variables.
const myObject = {}
require('dotenv').config({ processEnv: myObject })

console.log(myObject) // values from .env
console.log(process.env) // this was not changed or written to
Parse
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment
variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return
an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Options
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('hello world')
const opt = { debug: true }
const config = dotenv.parse(buf, opt)
// expect a debug message because the buffer is not in KEY=VAL form
Populate
The engine which populates the contents of your .env file to process.env is available for use. It accepts a target, a source, and options. This is useful for power users who want to supply their own objects.
For example, customizing the source:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'world' }

dotenv.populate(process.env, parsed)

console.log(process.env.HELLO) // world
For example, customizing the source AND target:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'universe' }
const target = { HELLO: 'world' } // empty object

dotenv.populate(target, parsed, { override: true, debug: true })

console.log(target) // { HELLO: 'universe' }
options
Debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being populated as you expect.
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set.
‚ùì FAQ
Why is the .env file not loading my environment variables successfully?
Most likely your .env file is not in the correct place. See this stack overflow.
Turn on debug mode and try again..
require('dotenv').config({ debug: true })
You will receive a helpful error outputted to your console.
Should I commit my .env file?
No. We strongly recommend against committing your .env file to version
control. It should only include environment-specific values such as database
passwords or API keys. Your production database should have a different
password than your development database.
Should I have multiple .env files?
We recommend creating one .env file per environment. Use .env for local/development, .env.production for production and so on. This still follows the twelve factor principles as each is attributed individually to its own environment. Avoid custom set ups that work in inheritance somehow (.env.production inherits values form .env for example). It is better to duplicate values if necessary across each .env.environment file.

In a twelve-factor app, env vars are granular controls, each fully orthogonal to other env vars. They are never grouped together as ‚Äúenvironments‚Äù, but instead are independently managed for each deploy. This is a model that scales up smoothly as the app naturally expands into more deploys over its lifetime.
‚Äì The Twelve-Factor App

What rules does the parsing engine follow?
The parsing engine currently supports the following rules:

BASIC=basic becomes {BASIC: 'basic'}
empty lines are skipped
lines beginning with # are treated as comments
# marks the beginning of a comment (unless when the value is wrapped in quotes)
empty values become empty strings (EMPTY= becomes {EMPTY: ''})
inner quotes are maintained (think JSON) (JSON={"foo": "bar"} becomes {JSON:"{\"foo\": \"bar\"}")
whitespace is removed from both ends of unquoted values (see more on trim) (FOO=  some value   becomes {FOO: 'some value'})
single and double quoted values are escaped (SINGLE_QUOTE='quoted' becomes {SINGLE_QUOTE: "quoted"})
single and double quoted values maintain whitespace from both ends (FOO="  some value  " becomes {FOO: '  some value  '})
double quoted values expand new lines (MULTILINE="new\nline" becomes

{MULTILINE: 'new
line'}


backticks are supported (BACKTICK_KEY=`This has 'single' and "double" quotes inside of it.`)

What happens to environment variables that were already set?
By default, we will never modify any environment variables that have already been set. In particular, if there is a variable in your .env file which collides with one that already exists in your environment, then that variable will be skipped.
If instead, you want to override process.env use the override option.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
How come my environment variables are not showing up for React?
Your React code is run in Webpack, where the fs module or even the process global itself are not accessible out-of-the-box. process.env can only be injected through Webpack configuration.
If you are using react-scripts, which is distributed through create-react-app, it has dotenv built in but with a quirk. Preface your environment variables with REACT_APP_. See this stack overflow for more details.
If you are using other frameworks (e.g. Next.js, Gatsby...), you need to consult their documentation for how to inject environment variables into the client.
Can I customize/write plugins for dotenv?
Yes! dotenv.config() returns an object representing the parsed .env file. This gives you everything you need to continue setting values on process.env. For example:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const variableExpansion = require('dotenv-expand')
const myEnv = dotenv.config()
variableExpansion(myEnv)
How do I use dotenv with import?
Simply..
// index.mjs (ESM)
import 'dotenv/config' // see https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#how-do-i-use-dotenv-with-import
import express from 'express'
A little background..

When you run a module containing an import declaration, the modules it imports are loaded first, then each module body is executed in a depth-first traversal of the dependency graph, avoiding cycles by skipping anything already executed.
‚Äì ES6 In Depth: Modules

What does this mean in plain language? It means you would think the following would work but it won't.
errorReporter.mjs:
class Client {
  constructor (apiKey) {
    console.log('apiKey', apiKey)

    this.apiKey = apiKey
  }
}

export default new Client(process.env.API_KEY)
index.mjs:
// Note: this is INCORRECT and will not work
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv'
dotenv.config()

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs' // process.env.API_KEY will be blank!
process.env.API_KEY will be blank.
Instead, index.mjs should be written as..
import 'dotenv/config'

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs'
Does that make sense? It's a bit unintuitive, but it is how importing of ES6 modules work. Here is a working example of this pitfall.
There are two alternatives to this approach:

Preload dotenv: node --require dotenv/config index.js (Note: you do not need to import dotenv with this approach)
Create a separate file that will execute config first as outlined in this comment on #133

Why am I getting the error Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'crypto|os|path'?
You are using dotenv on the front-end and have not included a polyfill. Webpack < 5 used to include these for you. Do the following:
npm install node-polyfill-webpack-plugin
Configure your webpack.config.js to something like the following.
require('dotenv').config()

const path = require('path');
const webpack = require('webpack')

const NodePolyfillPlugin = require('node-polyfill-webpack-plugin')

module.exports = {
  mode: 'development',
  entry: './src/index.ts',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  plugins: [
    new NodePolyfillPlugin(),
    new webpack.DefinePlugin({
      'process.env': {
        HELLO: JSON.stringify(process.env.HELLO)
      }
    }),
  ]
};
Alternatively, just use dotenv-webpack which does this and more behind the scenes for you.
What about variable expansion?
Try dotenv-expand
What about syncing and securing .env files?
Use dotenvx
What if I accidentally commit my .env file to code?
Remove it, remove git history and then install the git pre-commit hook to prevent this from ever happening again.
brew install dotenvx/brew/dotenvx
dotenvx precommit --install

How can I prevent committing my .env file to a Docker build?
Use the docker prebuild hook.
# Dockerfile
...
RUN curl -fsS https://dotenvx.sh/ | sh
...
RUN dotenvx prebuild
CMD ["dotenvx", "run", "--", "node", "index.js"]

PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nKh9NV...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
Comments
Comments may be added to your file on their own line or inline:
# This is a comment
SECRET_KEY=YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE # comment
SECRET_HASH="something-with-a-#-hash"
Comments begin where a # exists, so if your value contains a # please wrap it in quotes. This is a breaking change from >= v15.0.0 and on.
Parsing
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Preload

Note: Consider using dotenvx instead of preloading. I am now doing (and recommending) so.
It serves the same purpose (you do not need to require and load dotenv), adds better debugging, and works with ANY language, framework, or platform. ‚Äì motdotla

You can use the --require (-r) command line option to preload dotenv. By doing this, you do not need to require and load dotenv in your application code.
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
The configuration options below are supported as command line arguments in the format dotenv_config_<option>=value
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env dotenv_config_debug=true
Additionally, you can use environment variables to set configuration options. Command line arguments will precede these.
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_<OPTION>=value node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_ENCODING=latin1 DOTENV_CONFIG_DEBUG=true node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env
Variable Expansion
You need to add the value of another variable in one of your variables? Use dotenv-expand.
Command Substitution
Use dotenvx to use command substitution.
Add the output of a command to one of your variables in your .env file.
# .env
DATABASE_URL="postgres://$(whoami)@localhost/my_database"
// index.js
console.log('DATABASE_URL', process.env.DATABASE_URL)
$ dotenvx run --debug -- node index.js
[dotenvx@0.14.1] injecting env (1) from .env
DATABASE_URL postgres://yourusername@localhost/my_database
Syncing
You need to keep .env files in sync between machines, environments, or team members? Use dotenvx to encrypt your .env files and safely include them in source control. This still subscribes to the twelve-factor app rules by generating a decryption key separate from code.
Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx to generate .env.ci, .env.production files, and more.
Deploying
You need to deploy your secrets in a cloud-agnostic manner? Use dotenvx to generate a private decryption key that is set on your production server.
üå¥ Manage Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx
Run any environment locally. Create a .env.ENVIRONMENT file and use --env-file to load it. It's straightforward, yet flexible.
$ echo "HELLO=production" > .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.production -- node index.js
Hello production
> ^^
or with multiple .env files
$ echo "HELLO=local" > .env.local
$ echo "HELLO=World" > .env
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.local --env-file=.env -- node index.js
Hello local

üöÄ Deploying
Use dotenvx.
Add encryption to your .env files with a single command. Pass the --encrypt flag.
$ dotenvx set HELLO Production --encrypt -f .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION="<.env.production private key>" dotenvx run -- node index.js

üìñ Documentation
Dotenv exposes four functions:

config
parse
populate
decrypt

Config
config will read your .env file, parse the contents, assign it to
process.env,
and return an Object with a parsed key containing the loaded content or an error key if it failed.
const result = dotenv.config()

if (result.error) {
  throw result.error
}

console.log(result.parsed)
You can additionally, pass options to config.
Options
path
Default: path.resolve(process.cwd(), '.env')
Specify a custom path if your file containing environment variables is located elsewhere.
require('dotenv').config({ path: '/custom/path/to/.env' })
By default, config will look for a file called .env in the current working directory.
Pass in multiple files as an array, and they will be parsed in order and combined with process.env (or option.processEnv, if set). The first value set for a variable will win, unless the options.override flag is set, in which case the last value set will win.  If a value already exists in process.env and the options.override flag is NOT set, no changes will be made to that value.
require('dotenv').config({ path: ['.env.local', '.env'] })
encoding
Default: utf8
Specify the encoding of your file containing environment variables.
require('dotenv').config({ encoding: 'latin1' })
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
require('dotenv').config({ debug: process.env.DEBUG })
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set on your machine with values from your .env file(s). If multiple files have been provided in option.path the override will also be used as each file is combined with the next. Without override being set, the first value wins. With override set the last value wins.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
processEnv
Default: process.env
Specify an object to write your environment variables to. Defaults to process.env environment variables.
const myObject = {}
require('dotenv').config({ processEnv: myObject })

console.log(myObject) // values from .env
console.log(process.env) // this was not changed or written to
Parse
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment
variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return
an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Options
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('hello world')
const opt = { debug: true }
const config = dotenv.parse(buf, opt)
// expect a debug message because the buffer is not in KEY=VAL form
Populate
The engine which populates the contents of your .env file to process.env is available for use. It accepts a target, a source, and options. This is useful for power users who want to supply their own objects.
For example, customizing the source:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'world' }

dotenv.populate(process.env, parsed)

console.log(process.env.HELLO) // world
For example, customizing the source AND target:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'universe' }
const target = { HELLO: 'world' } // empty object

dotenv.populate(target, parsed, { override: true, debug: true })

console.log(target) // { HELLO: 'universe' }
options
Debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being populated as you expect.
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set.
‚ùì FAQ
Why is the .env file not loading my environment variables successfully?
Most likely your .env file is not in the correct place. See this stack overflow.
Turn on debug mode and try again..
require('dotenv').config({ debug: true })
You will receive a helpful error outputted to your console.
Should I commit my .env file?
No. We strongly recommend against committing your .env file to version
control. It should only include environment-specific values such as database
passwords or API keys. Your production database should have a different
password than your development database.
Should I have multiple .env files?
We recommend creating one .env file per environment. Use .env for local/development, .env.production for production and so on. This still follows the twelve factor principles as each is attributed individually to its own environment. Avoid custom set ups that work in inheritance somehow (.env.production inherits values form .env for example). It is better to duplicate values if necessary across each .env.environment file.

In a twelve-factor app, env vars are granular controls, each fully orthogonal to other env vars. They are never grouped together as ‚Äúenvironments‚Äù, but instead are independently managed for each deploy. This is a model that scales up smoothly as the app naturally expands into more deploys over its lifetime.
‚Äì The Twelve-Factor App

What rules does the parsing engine follow?
The parsing engine currently supports the following rules:

BASIC=basic becomes {BASIC: 'basic'}
empty lines are skipped
lines beginning with # are treated as comments
# marks the beginning of a comment (unless when the value is wrapped in quotes)
empty values become empty strings (EMPTY= becomes {EMPTY: ''})
inner quotes are maintained (think JSON) (JSON={"foo": "bar"} becomes {JSON:"{\"foo\": \"bar\"}")
whitespace is removed from both ends of unquoted values (see more on trim) (FOO=  some value   becomes {FOO: 'some value'})
single and double quoted values are escaped (SINGLE_QUOTE='quoted' becomes {SINGLE_QUOTE: "quoted"})
single and double quoted values maintain whitespace from both ends (FOO="  some value  " becomes {FOO: '  some value  '})
double quoted values expand new lines (MULTILINE="new\nline" becomes

{MULTILINE: 'new
line'}


backticks are supported (BACKTICK_KEY=`This has 'single' and "double" quotes inside of it.`)

What happens to environment variables that were already set?
By default, we will never modify any environment variables that have already been set. In particular, if there is a variable in your .env file which collides with one that already exists in your environment, then that variable will be skipped.
If instead, you want to override process.env use the override option.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
How come my environment variables are not showing up for React?
Your React code is run in Webpack, where the fs module or even the process global itself are not accessible out-of-the-box. process.env can only be injected through Webpack configuration.
If you are using react-scripts, which is distributed through create-react-app, it has dotenv built in but with a quirk. Preface your environment variables with REACT_APP_. See this stack overflow for more details.
If you are using other frameworks (e.g. Next.js, Gatsby...), you need to consult their documentation for how to inject environment variables into the client.
Can I customize/write plugins for dotenv?
Yes! dotenv.config() returns an object representing the parsed .env file. This gives you everything you need to continue setting values on process.env. For example:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const variableExpansion = require('dotenv-expand')
const myEnv = dotenv.config()
variableExpansion(myEnv)
How do I use dotenv with import?
Simply..
// index.mjs (ESM)
import 'dotenv/config' // see https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#how-do-i-use-dotenv-with-import
import express from 'express'
A little background..

When you run a module containing an import declaration, the modules it imports are loaded first, then each module body is executed in a depth-first traversal of the dependency graph, avoiding cycles by skipping anything already executed.
‚Äì ES6 In Depth: Modules

What does this mean in plain language? It means you would think the following would work but it won't.
errorReporter.mjs:
class Client {
  constructor (apiKey) {
    console.log('apiKey', apiKey)

    this.apiKey = apiKey
  }
}

export default new Client(process.env.API_KEY)
index.mjs:
// Note: this is INCORRECT and will not work
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv'
dotenv.config()

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs' // process.env.API_KEY will be blank!
process.env.API_KEY will be blank.
Instead, index.mjs should be written as..
import 'dotenv/config'

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs'
Does that make sense? It's a bit unintuitive, but it is how importing of ES6 modules work. Here is a working example of this pitfall.
There are two alternatives to this approach:

Preload dotenv: node --require dotenv/config index.js (Note: you do not need to import dotenv with this approach)
Create a separate file that will execute config first as outlined in this comment on #133

Why am I getting the error Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'crypto|os|path'?
You are using dotenv on the front-end and have not included a polyfill. Webpack < 5 used to include these for you. Do the following:
npm install node-polyfill-webpack-plugin
Configure your webpack.config.js to something like the following.
require('dotenv').config()

const path = require('path');
const webpack = require('webpack')

const NodePolyfillPlugin = require('node-polyfill-webpack-plugin')

module.exports = {
  mode: 'development',
  entry: './src/index.ts',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  plugins: [
    new NodePolyfillPlugin(),
    new webpack.DefinePlugin({
      'process.env': {
        HELLO: JSON.stringify(process.env.HELLO)
      }
    }),
  ]
};
Alternatively, just use dotenv-webpack which does this and more behind the scenes for you.
What about variable expansion?
Try dotenv-expand
What about syncing and securing .env files?
Use dotenvx
What if I accidentally commit my .env file to code?
Remove it, remove git history and then install the git pre-commit hook to prevent this from ever happening again.
brew install dotenvx/brew/dotenvx
dotenvx precommit --install

How can I prevent committing my .env file to a Docker build?
Use the docker prebuild hook.
# Dockerfile
...
RUN curl -fsS https://dotenvx.sh/ | sh
...
RUN dotenvx prebuild
CMD ["dotenvx", "run", "--", "node", "index.js"]

dotenv 

Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology.

üå± Install
npm install dotenv --save
You can also use an npm-compatible package manager like yarn or bun:
yarn add dotenv
# or
bun add dotenv
üèóÔ∏è Usage






Create a .env file in the root of your project (if using a monorepo structure like apps/backend/app.js, put it in the root of the folder where your app.js process runs):
S3_BUCKET="YOURS3BUCKET"
SECRET_KEY="YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE"
As early as possible in your application, import and configure dotenv:
require('dotenv').config()
console.log(process.env) // remove this after you've confirmed it is working
.. or using ES6?
import 'dotenv/config'
That's it. process.env now has the keys and values you defined in your .env file:
require('dotenv').config()
// or import 'dotenv/config' if you're using ES6

...

s3.getBucketCors({Bucket: process.env.S3_BUCKET}, function(err, data) {})
Multiline values
If you need multiline variables, for example private keys, those are now supported (>= v15.0.0) with line breaks:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
...
Kh9NV...
...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
Alternatively, you can double quote strings and use the \n character:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nKh9NV...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
Comments
Comments may be added to your file on their own line or inline:
# This is a comment
SECRET_KEY=YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE # comment
SECRET_HASH="something-with-a-#-hash"
Comments begin where a # exists, so if your value contains a # please wrap it in quotes. This is a breaking change from >= v15.0.0 and on.
Parsing
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }

Pass in multiple files as an array, and they will be parsed in order and combined with process.env (or option.processEnv, if set). The first value set for a variable will win, unless the options.override flag is set, in which case the last value set will win.  If a value already exists in process.env and the options.override flag is NOT set, no changes will be made to that value.
require('dotenv').config({ path: ['.env.local', '.env'] })
encoding
Default: utf8
Specify the encoding of your file containing environment variables.
require('dotenv').config({ encoding: 'latin1' })
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
require('dotenv').config({ debug: process.env.DEBUG })
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set on your machine with values from your .env file(s). If multiple files have been provided in option.path the override will also be used as each file is combined with the next. Without override being set, the first value wins. With override set the last value wins.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
processEnv
Default: process.env
Specify an object to write your environment variables to. Defaults to process.env environment variables.
const myObject = {}
require('dotenv').config({ processEnv: myObject })

console.log(myObject) // values from .env
console.log(process.env) // this was not changed or written to
Parse
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment
variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return
an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Options
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('hello world')
const opt = { debug: true }
const config = dotenv.parse(buf, opt)
// expect a debug message because the buffer is not in KEY=VAL form
Populate
The engine which populates the contents of your .env file to process.env is available for use. It accepts a target, a source, and options. This is useful for power users who want to supply their own objects.
For example, customizing the source:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'world' }

dotenv.populate(process.env, parsed)

console.log(process.env.HELLO) // world
For example, customizing the source AND target:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'universe' }
const target = { HELLO: 'world' } // empty object

dotenv.populate(target, parsed, { override: true, debug: true })

console.log(target) // { HELLO: 'universe' }
options
Debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being populated as you expect.
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set.
‚ùì FAQ
Why is the .env file not loading my environment variables successfully?
Most likely your .env file is not in the correct place. See this stack overflow.
Turn on debug mode and try again..
require('dotenv').config({ debug: true })
You will receive a helpful error outputted to your console.
Should I commit my .env file?
No. We strongly recommend against committing your .env file to version
control. It should only include environment-specific values such as database
passwords or API keys. Your production database should have a different
password than your development database.
Should I have multiple .env files?
We recommend creating one .env file per environment. Use .env for local/development, .env.production for production and so on. This still follows the twelve factor principles as each is attributed individually to its own environment. Avoid custom set ups that work in inheritance somehow (.env.production inherits values form .env for example). It is better to duplicate values if necessary across each .env.environment file.

In a twelve-factor app, env vars are granular controls, each fully orthogonal to other env vars. They are never grouped together as ‚Äúenvironments‚Äù, but instead are independently managed for each deploy. This is a model that scales up smoothly as the app naturally expands into more deploys over its lifetime.
‚Äì The Twelve-Factor App

What rules does the parsing engine follow?
The parsing engine currently supports the following rules:

BASIC=basic becomes {BASIC: 'basic'}
empty lines are skipped
lines beginning with # are treated as comments
# marks the beginning of a comment (unless when the value is wrapped in quotes)
empty values become empty strings (EMPTY= becomes {EMPTY: ''})
inner quotes are maintained (think JSON) (JSON={"foo": "bar"} becomes {JSON:"{\"foo\": \"bar\"}")
whitespace is removed from both ends of unquoted values (see more on trim) (FOO=  some value   becomes {FOO: 'some value'})
single and double quoted values are escaped (SINGLE_QUOTE='quoted' becomes {SINGLE_QUOTE: "quoted"})
single and double quoted values maintain whitespace from both ends (FOO="  some value  " becomes {FOO: '  some value  '})
double quoted values expand new lines (MULTILINE="new\nline" becomes

{MULTILINE: 'new
line'}


backticks are supported (BACKTICK_KEY=`This has 'single' and "double" quotes inside of it.`)

What happens to environment variables that were already set?
By default, we will never modify any environment variables that have already been set. In particular, if there is a variable in your .env file which collides with one that already exists in your environment, then that variable will be skipped.
If instead, you want to override process.env use the override option.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
How come my environment variables are not showing up for React?
Your React code is run in Webpack, where the fs module or even the process global itself are not accessible out-of-the-box. process.env can only be injected through Webpack configuration.
If you are using react-scripts, which is distributed through create-react-app, it has dotenv built in but with a quirk. Preface your environment variables with REACT_APP_. See this stack overflow for more details.
If you are using other frameworks (e.g. Next.js, Gatsby...), you need to consult their documentation for how to inject environment variables into the client.
Can I customize/write plugins for dotenv?
Yes! dotenv.config() returns an object representing the parsed .env file. This gives you everything you need to continue setting values on process.env. For example:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const variableExpansion = require('dotenv-expand')
const myEnv = dotenv.config()
variableExpansion(myEnv)
How do I use dotenv with import?
Simply..
// index.mjs (ESM)
import 'dotenv/config' // see https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#how-do-i-use-dotenv-with-import
import express from 'express'
A little background..

When you run a module containing an import declaration, the modules it imports are loaded first, then each module body is executed in a depth-first traversal of the dependency graph, avoiding cycles by skipping anything already executed.
‚Äì ES6 In Depth: Modules

What does this mean in plain language? It means you would think the following would work but it won't.
errorReporter.mjs:
class Client {
  constructor (apiKey) {
    console.log('apiKey', apiKey)

    this.apiKey = apiKey
  }
}

export default new Client(process.env.API_KEY)
index.mjs:
// Note: this is INCORRECT and will not work
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv'
dotenv.config()

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs' // process.env.API_KEY will be blank!
process.env.API_KEY will be blank.
Instead, index.mjs should be written as..
import 'dotenv/config'

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs'
Does that make sense? It's a bit unintuitive, but it is how importing of ES6 modules work. Here is a working example of this pitfall.
There are two alternatives to this approach:

Preload dotenv: node --require dotenv/config index.js (Note: you do not need to import dotenv with this approach)
Create a separate file that will execute config first as outlined in this comment on #133

Why am I getting the error Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'crypto|os|path'?
You are using dotenv on the front-end and have not included a polyfill. Webpack < 5 used to include these for you. Do the following:
npm install node-polyfill-webpack-plugin
Configure your webpack.config.js to something like the following.
require('dotenv').config()

const path = require('path');
const webpack = require('webpack')

const NodePolyfillPlugin = require('node-polyfill-webpack-plugin')

module.exports = {
  mode: 'development',
  entry: './src/index.ts',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  plugins: [
    new NodePolyfillPlugin(),
    new webpack.DefinePlugin({
      'process.env': {
        HELLO: JSON.stringify(process.env.HELLO)
      }
    }),
  ]
};
Alternatively, just use dotenv-webpack which does this and more behind the scenes for you.
What about variable expansion?
Try dotenv-expand
What about syncing and securing .env files?
Use dotenvx
What if I accidentally commit my .env file to code?
Remove it, remove git history and then install the git pre-commit hook to prevent this from ever happening again.
brew install dotenvx/brew/dotenvx
dotenvx precommit --install

How can I prevent committing my .env file to a Docker build?
Use the docker prebuild hook.
# Dockerfile
...
RUN curl -fsS https://dotenvx.sh/ | sh
...
RUN dotenvx prebuild
CMD ["dotenvx", "run", "--", "node", "index.js"]

dotenv 

Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology.

üå± Install
npm install dotenv --save
You can also use an npm-compatible package manager like yarn or bun:
yarn add dotenv
# or
bun add dotenv
üèóÔ∏è Usage






Create a .env file in the root of your project (if using a monorepo structure like apps/backend/app.js, put it in the root of the folder where your app.js process runs):
S3_BUCKET="YOURS3BUCKET"
SECRET_KEY="YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE"
As early as possible in your application, import and configure dotenv:
require('dotenv').config()
console.log(process.env) // remove this after you've confirmed it is working
.. or using ES6?
import 'dotenv/config'
That's it. process.env now has the keys and values you defined in your .env file:
require('dotenv').config()
// or import 'dotenv/config' if you're using ES6

...

s3.getBucketCors({Bucket: process.env.S3_BUCKET}, function(err, data) {})
Multiline values
If you need multiline variables, for example private keys, those are now supported (>= v15.0.0) with line breaks:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
...
Kh9NV...
...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
Alternatively, you can double quote strings and use the \n character:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nKh9NV...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
Comments
Comments may be added to your file on their own line or inline:
# This is a comment
SECRET_KEY=YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE # comment
SECRET_HASH="something-with-a-#-hash"
Comments begin where a # exists, so if your value contains a # please wrap it in quotes. This is a breaking change from >= v15.0.0 and on.
Parsing
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Preload

Note: Consider using dotenvx instead of preloading. I am now doing (and recommending) so.
It serves the same purpose (you do not need to require and load dotenv), adds better debugging, and works with ANY language, framework, or platform. ‚Äì motdotla

You can use the --require (-r) command line option to preload dotenv. By doing this, you do not need to require and load dotenv in your application code.
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
The configuration options below are supported as command line arguments in the format dotenv_config_<option>=value
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env dotenv_config_debug=true
Additionally, you can use environment variables to set configuration options. Command line arguments will precede these.
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_<OPTION>=value node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_ENCODING=latin1 DOTENV_CONFIG_DEBUG=true node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env
Variable Expansion
You need to add the value of another variable in one of your variables? Use dotenv-expand.
Command Substitution
Use dotenvx to use command substitution.
Add the output of a command to one of your variables in your .env file.
# .env
DATABASE_URL="postgres://$(whoami)@localhost/my_database"
// index.js
console.log('DATABASE_URL', process.env.DATABASE_URL)
$ dotenvx run --debug -- node index.js
[dotenvx@0.14.1] injecting env (1) from .env
DATABASE_URL postgres://yourusername@localhost/my_database
Syncing
You need to keep .env files in sync between machines, environments, or team members? Use dotenvx to encrypt your .env files and safely include them in source control. This still subscribes to the twelve-factor app rules by generating a decryption key separate from code.
Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx to generate .env.ci, .env.production files, and more.
Deploying
You need to deploy your secrets in a cloud-agnostic manner? Use dotenvx to generate a private decryption key that is set on your production server.
üå¥ Manage Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx
Run any environment locally. Create a .env.ENVIRONMENT file and use --env-file to load it. It's straightforward, yet flexible.
$ echo "HELLO=production" > .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.production -- node index.js
Hello production
> ^^
or with multiple .env files
$ echo "HELLO=local" > .env.local
$ echo "HELLO=World" > .env
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.local --env-file=.env -- node index.js
Hello local
more environment examples
üöÄ Deploying
Use dotenvx.
Add encryption to your .env files with a single command. Pass the --encrypt flag.
$ dotenvx set HELLO Production --encrypt -f .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION="<.env.production private key>" dotenvx run -- node index.js
[dotenvx] injecting env (2) from .env.production
Hello Production

üìñ Documentation
Dotenv exposes four functions:

config
parse
populate
decrypt

Config
config will read your .env file, parse the contents, assign it to
process.env,
and return an Object with a parsed key containing the loaded content or an error key if it failed.
const result = dotenv.config()

if (result.error) {
  throw result.error
}

console.log(result.parsed)
You can additionally, pass options to config.
Options
path
Default: path.resolve(process.cwd(), '.env')
Specify a custom path if your file containing environment variables is located elsewhere.
require('dotenv').config({ path: '/custom/path/to/.env' })
By default, config will look for a file called .env in the current working directory.
Pass in multiple files as an array, and they will be parsed in order and combined with process.env (or option.processEnv, if set). The first value set for a variable will win, unless the options.override flag is set, in which case the last value set will win.  If a value already exists in process.env and the options.override flag is NOT set, no changes will be made to that value.
require('dotenv').config({ path: ['.env.local', '.env'] })
encoding
Default: utf8
Specify the encoding of your file containing environment variables.
require('dotenv').config({ encoding: 'latin1' })
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
require('dotenv').config({ debug: process.env.DEBUG })
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set on your machine with values from your .env file(s). If multiple files have been provided in option.path the override will also be used as each file is combined with the next. Without override being set, the first value wins. With override set the last value wins.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
processEnv
Default: process.env
Specify an object to write your environment variables to. Defaults to process.env environment variables.
const myObject = {}
require('dotenv').config({ processEnv: myObject })

console.log(myObject) // values from .env
console.log(process.env) // this was not changed or written to
Parse
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment
variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return
an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Options
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('hello world')
const opt = { debug: true }
const config = dotenv.parse(buf, opt)
// expect a debug message because the buffer is not in KEY=VAL form
Populate
The engine which populates the contents of your .env file to process.env is available for use. It accepts a target, a source, and options. This is useful for power users who want to supply their own objects.
For example, customizing the source:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'world' }

dotenv.populate(process.env, parsed)

console.log(process.env.HELLO) // world
For example, customizing the source AND target:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'universe' }
const target = { HELLO: 'world' } // empty object

dotenv.populate(target, parsed, { override: true, debug: true })

console.log(target) // { HELLO: 'universe' }
options
Debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being populated as you expect.
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set.

single and double quoted values maintain whitespace from both ends (FOO="  some value  " becomes {FOO: '  some value  '})
double quoted values expand new lines (MULTILINE="new\nline" becomes

{MULTILINE: 'new
line'}


backticks are supported (BACKTICK_KEY=`This has 'single' and "double" quotes inside of it.`)

What happens to environment variables that were already set?
By default, we will never modify any environment variables that have already been set. In particular, if there is a variable in your .env file which collides with one that already exists in your environment, then that variable will be skipped.
If instead, you want to override process.env use the override option.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
How come my environment variables are not showing up for React?
Your React code is run in Webpack, where the fs module or even the process global itself are not accessible out-of-the-box. process.env can only be injected through Webpack configuration.
If you are using react-scripts, which is distributed through create-react-app, it has dotenv built in but with a quirk. Preface your environment variables with REACT_APP_. See this stack overflow for more details.
If you are using other frameworks (e.g. Next.js, Gatsby...), you need to consult their documentation for how to inject environment variables into the client.
Can I customize/write plugins for dotenv?
Yes! dotenv.config() returns an object representing the parsed .env file. This gives you everything you need to continue setting values on process.env. For example:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const variableExpansion = require('dotenv-expand')
const myEnv = dotenv.config()
variableExpansion(myEnv)
How do I use dotenv with import?
Simply..
// index.mjs (ESM)
import 'dotenv/config' // see https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#how-do-i-use-dotenv-with-import
import express from 'express'
A little background..

When you run a module containing an import declaration, the modules it imports are loaded first, then each module body is executed in a depth-first traversal of the dependency graph, avoiding cycles by skipping anything already executed.
‚Äì ES6 In Depth: Modules

What does this mean in plain language? It means you would think the following would work but it won't.
errorReporter.mjs:
class Client {
  constructor (apiKey) {
    console.log('apiKey', apiKey)

    this.apiKey = apiKey
  }
}

export default new Client(process.env.API_KEY)
index.mjs:
// Note: this is INCORRECT and will not work
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv'
dotenv.config()

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs' // process.env.API_KEY will be blank!
process.env.API_KEY will be blank.
Instead, index.mjs should be written as..
import 'dotenv/config'

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs'
Does that make sense? It's a bit unintuitive, but it is how importing of ES6 modules work. Here is a working example of this pitfall.
There are two alternatives to this approach:

Preload dotenv: node --require dotenv/config index.js (Note: you do not need to import dotenv with this approach)
Create a separate file that will execute config first as outlined in this comment on #133

Why am I getting the error Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'crypto|os|path'?
You are using dotenv on the front-end and have not included a polyfill. Webpack < 5 used to include these for you. Do the following:
npm install node-polyfill-webpack-plugin
Configure your webpack.config.js to something like the following.
require('dotenv').config()

const path = require('path');
const webpack = require('webpack')

const NodePolyfillPlugin = require('node-polyfill-webpack-plugin')

module.exports = {
  mode: 'development',
  entry: './src/index.ts',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  plugins: [
    new NodePolyfillPlugin(),
    new webpack.DefinePlugin({
      'process.env': {
        HELLO: JSON.stringify(process.env.HELLO)
      }
    }),
  ]
};
Alternatively, just use dotenv-webpack which does this and more behind the scenes for you.
What about variable expansion?
Try dotenv-expand
What about syncing and securing .env files?
Use dotenvx
What if I accidentally commit my .env file to code?
Remove it, remove git history and then install the git pre-commit hook to prevent this from ever happening again.
brew install dotenvx/brew/dotenvx
dotenvx precommit --install

How can I prevent committing my .env file to a Docker build?
Use the docker prebuild hook.
# Dockerfile

RUN curl -fsS https://dotenvx.sh/ | sh
...
RUN dotenvx prebuild
CMD ["dotenvx", "run", "--", "node", "index.js"]

dotenv 

Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology.

üå± Install
npm install dotenv --save
You can also use an npm-compatible package manager like yarn or bun:
yarn add dotenv
# or
bun add dotenv
üèóÔ∏è Usage






Create a .env file in the root of your project (if using a monorepo structure like apps/backend/app.js, put it in the root of the folder where your app.js process runs):
S3_BUCKET="YOURS3BUCKET"
SECRET_KEY="YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE"
As early as possible in your application, import and configure dotenv:
require('dotenv').config()
console.log(process.env) // remove this after you've confirmed it is working
.. or using ES6?
import 'dotenv/config'
That's it. process.env now has the keys and values you defined in your .env file:
require('dotenv').config()
// or import 'dotenv/config' if you're using ES6

...

s3.getBucketCors({Bucket: process.env.S3_BUCKET}, function(err, data) {})
Multiline values
If you need multiline variables, for example private keys, those are now supported (>= v15.0.0) with line breaks:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
...
Kh9NV...
...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
Alternatively, you can double quote strings and use the \n character:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nKh9NV...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
Comments
Comments may be added to your file on their own line or inline:
# This is a comment
SECRET_KEY=YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE # comment
SECRET_HASH="something-with-a-#-hash"
Comments begin where a # exists, so if your value contains a # please wrap it in quotes. This is a breaking change from >= v15.0.0 and on.
Parsing
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Preload

Note: Consider using dotenvx instead of preloading. I am now doing (and recommending) so.
It serves the same purpose (you do not need to require and load dotenv), adds better debugging, and works with ANY language, framework, or platform. ‚Äì motdotla

You can use the --require (-r) command line option to preload dotenv. By doing this, you do not need to require and load dotenv in your application code.
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
The configuration options below are supported as command line arguments in the format dotenv_config_<option>=value
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env dotenv_config_debug=true
Additionally, you can use environment variables to set configuration options. Command line arguments will precede these.
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_<OPTION>=value node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_ENCODING=latin1 DOTENV_CONFIG_DEBUG=true node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env
Variable Expansion
You need to add the value of another variable in one of your variables? Use dotenv-expand.
Command Substitution
Use dotenvx to use command substitution.
Add the output of a command to one of your variables in your .env file.
# .env
DATABASE_URL="postgres://$(whoami)@localhost/my_database"
// index.js
console.log('DATABASE_URL', process.env.DATABASE_URL)
$ dotenvx run --debug -- node index.js
[dotenvx@0.14.1] injecting env (1) from .env
DATABASE_URL postgres://yourusername@localhost/my_database
Syncing
You need to keep .env files in sync between machines, environments, or team members? Use dotenvx to encrypt your .env files and safely include them in source control. This still subscribes to the twelve-factor app rules by generating a decryption key separate from code.
Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx to generate .env.ci, .env.production files, and more.
Deploying
You need to deploy your secrets in a cloud-agnostic manner? Use dotenvx to generate a private decryption key that is set on your production server.
üå¥ Manage Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx
Run any environment locally. Create a .env.ENVIRONMENT file and use --env-file to load it. It's straightforward, yet flexible.
$ echo "HELLO=production" > .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.production -- node index.js
Hello production
> ^^
or with multiple .env files
$ echo "HELLO=local" > .env.local
$ echo "HELLO=World" > .env
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.local --env-file=.env -- node index.js
Hello local
more environment examples
üöÄ Deploying
Use dotenvx.
Add encryption to your .env files with a single command. Pass the --encrypt flag.
$ dotenvx set HELLO Production --encrypt -f .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION="<.env.production private key>" dotenvx run -- node index.js
[dotenvx] injecting env (2) from .env.production
Hello Production

üìñ Documentation
Dotenv exposes four functions:

config
parse
populate
decrypt

Config
config will read your .env file, parse the contents, assign it to
process.env,
and return an Object with a parsed key containing the loaded content or an error key if it failed.
const result = dotenv.config()

if (result.error) {
  throw result.error
}

console.log(result.parsed)
You can additionally, pass options to config.
Options
path
Default: path.resolve(process.cwd(), '.env')
Specify a custom path if your file containing environment variables is located elsewhere.
require('dotenv').config({ path: '/custom/path/to/.env' })
By default, config will look for a file called .env in the current working directory.
Pass in multiple files as an array, and they will be parsed in order and combined with process.env (or option.processEnv, if set). The first value set for a variable will win, unless the options.override flag is set, in which case the last value set will win.  If a value already exists in process.env and the options.override flag is NOT set, no changes will be made to that value.
require('dotenv').config({ path: ['.env.local', '.env'] })
encoding
Default: utf8
Specify the encoding of your file containing environment variables.
require('dotenv').config({ encoding: 'latin1' })
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
require('dotenv').config({ debug: process.env.DEBUG })
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set on your machine with values from your .env file(s). If multiple files have been provided in option.path the override will also be used as each file is combined with the next. Without override being set, the first value wins. With override set the last value wins.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
processEnv
Default: process.env
Specify an object to write your environment variables to. Defaults to process.env environment variables.
const myObject = {}
require('dotenv').config({ processEnv: myObject })

console.log(myObject) // values from .env
console.log(process.env) // this was not changed or written to
Parse
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment
variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return
an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Options
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('hello world')
const opt = { debug: true }
const config = dotenv.parse(buf, opt)
// expect a debug message because the buffer is not in KEY=VAL form
Populate
The engine which populates the contents of your .env file to process.env is available for use. It accepts a target, a source, and options. This is useful for power users who want to supply their own objects.
For example, customizing the source:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'world' }

dotenv.populate(process.env, parsed)

console.log(process.env.HELLO) // world
For example, customizing the source AND target:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'universe' }
const target = { HELLO: 'world' } // empty object

dotenv.populate(target, parsed, { override: true, debug: true })

console.log(target) // { HELLO: 'universe' }
options
Debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being populated as you expect.
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set.
‚ùì FAQ
Why is the .env file not loading my environment variables successfully?
Most likely your .env file is not in the correct place. See this stack overflow.
Turn on debug mode and try again..
require('dotenv').config({ debug: true })
You will receive a helpful error outputted to your console.
Should I commit my .env file?
No. We strongly recommend against committing your .env file to version
control. It should only include environment-specific values such as database
passwords or API keys. Your production database should have a different
password than your development database.
Should I have multiple .env files?
We recommend creating one .env file per environment. Use .env for local/development, .env.production for production and so on. This still follows the twelve factor principles as each is attributed individually to its own environment. Avoid custom set ups that work in inheritance somehow (.env.production inherits values form .env for example). It is better to duplicate values if necessary across each .env.environment file.

In a twelve-factor app, env vars are granular controls, each fully orthogonal to other env vars. They are never grouped together as ‚Äúenvironments‚Äù, but instead are independently managed for each deploy. This is a model that scales up smoothly as the app naturally expands into more deploys over its lifetime.
‚Äì The Twelve-Factor App

What rules does the parsing engine follow?
The parsing engine currently supports the following rules:

BASIC=basic becomes {BASIC: 'basic'}
empty lines are skipped
lines beginning with # are treated as comments
# marks the beginning of a comment (unless when the value is wrapped in quotes)
empty values become empty strings (EMPTY= becomes {EMPTY: ''})
inner quotes are maintained (think JSON) (JSON={"foo": "bar"} becomes {JSON:"{\"foo\": \"bar\"}")
whitespace is removed from both ends of unquoted values (see more on trim) (FOO=  some value   becomes {FOO: 'some value'})
single and double quoted values are escaped (SINGLE_QUOTE='quoted' becomes {SINGLE_QUOTE: "quoted"})
single and double quoted values maintain whitespace from both ends (FOO="  some value  " becomes {FOO: '  some value  '})
double quoted values expand new lines (MULTILINE="new\nline" becomes

{MULTILINE: 'new
line'}


backticks are supported (BACKTICK_KEY=`This has 'single' and "double" quotes inside of it.`)

What happens to environment variables that were already set?
By default, we will never modify any environment variables that have already been set. In particular, if there is a variable in your .env file which collides with one that already exists in your environment, then that variable will be skipped.
If instead, you want to override process.env use the override option.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
How come my environment variables are not showing up for React?
Your React code is run in Webpack, where the fs module or even the process global itself are not accessible out-of-the-box. process.env can only be injected through Webpack configuration.
If you are using react-scripts, which is distributed through create-react-app, it has dotenv built in but with a quirk. Preface your environment variables with REACT_APP_. See this stack overflow for more details.
If you are using other frameworks (e.g. Next.js, Gatsby...), you need to consult their documentation for how to inject environment variables into the client.
Can I customize/write plugins for dotenv?
Yes! dotenv.config() returns an object representing the parsed .env file. This gives you everything you need to continue setting values on process.env. For example:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const variableExpansion = require('dotenv-expand')
const myEnv = dotenv.config()
variableExpansion(myEnv)
How do I use dotenv with import?
Simply..
// index.mjs (ESM)
import 'dotenv/config' // see https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#how-do-i-use-dotenv-with-import
import express from 'express'
A little background..

When you run a module containing an import declaration, the modules it imports are loaded first, then each module body is executed in a depth-first traversal of the dependency graph, avoiding cycles by skipping anything already executed.

You are using dotenv on the front-end and have not included a polyfill. Webpack < 5 used to include these for you. Do the following:
npm install node-polyfill-webpack-plugin
Configure your webpack.config.js to something like the following.
require('dotenv').config()

const path = require('path');
const webpack = require('webpack')

const NodePolyfillPlugin = require('node-polyfill-webpack-plugin')

module.exports = {
  mode: 'development',
  entry: './src/index.ts',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  plugins: [
    new NodePolyfillPlugin(),
    new webpack.DefinePlugin({
      'process.env': {
        HELLO: JSON.stringify(process.env.HELLO)
      }
    }),
  ]
};

dotenv 

Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology.

üå± Install
npm install dotenv --save
You can also use an npm-compatible package manager like yarn or bun:
yarn add dotenv
# or
bun add dotenv
üèóÔ∏è Usage






Create a .env file in the root of your project (if using a monorepo structure like apps/backend/app.js, put it in the root of the folder where your app.js process runs):
S3_BUCKET="YOURS3BUCKET"
SECRET_KEY="YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE"
As early as possible in your application, import and configure dotenv:
require('dotenv').config()
console.log(process.env) // remove this after you've confirmed it is working
.. or using ES6?
import 'dotenv/config'
That's it. process.env now has the keys and values you defined in your .env file:
require('dotenv').config()
// or import 'dotenv/config' if you're using ES6

...

s3.getBucketCors({Bucket: process.env.S3_BUCKET}, function(err, data) {})
Multiline values
If you need multiline variables, for example private keys, those are now supported (>= v15.0.0) with line breaks:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
...
Kh9NV...
...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
Alternatively, you can double quote strings and use the \n character:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nKh9NV...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
Comments
Comments may be added to your file on their own line or inline:
# This is a comment
SECRET_KEY=YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE # comment
SECRET_HASH="something-with-a-#-hash"
Comments begin where a # exists, so if your value contains a # please wrap it in quotes. This is a breaking change from >= v15.0.0 and on.
Parsing
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Preload

Note: Consider using dotenvx instead of preloading. I am now doing (and recommending) so.
It serves the same purpose (you do not need to require and load dotenv), adds better debugging, and works with ANY language, framework, or platform. ‚Äì motdotla

You can use the --require (-r) command line option to preload dotenv. By doing this, you do not need to require and load dotenv in your application code.
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
The configuration options below are supported as command line arguments in the format dotenv_config_<option>=value
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env dotenv_config_debug=true
Additionally, you can use environment variables to set configuration options. Command line arguments will precede these.
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_<OPTION>=value node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_ENCODING=latin1 DOTENV_CONFIG_DEBUG=true node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env
Variable Expansion
You need to add the value of another variable in one of your variables? Use dotenv-expand.
Command Substitution
Use dotenvx to use command substitution.
Add the output of a command to one of your variables in your .env file.
# .env
DATABASE_URL="postgres://$(whoami)@localhost/my_database"
// index.js
console.log('DATABASE_URL', process.env.DATABASE_URL)
$ dotenvx run --debug -- node index.js
[dotenvx@0.14.1] injecting env (1) from .env
DATABASE_URL postgres://yourusername@localhost/my_database
Syncing
You need to keep .env files in sync between machines, environments, or team members? Use dotenvx to encrypt your .env files and safely include them in source control. This still subscribes to the twelve-factor app rules by generating a decryption key separate from code.
Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx to generate .env.ci, .env.production files, and more.
Deploying
You need to deploy your secrets in a cloud-agnostic manner? Use dotenvx to generate a private decryption key that is set on your production server.
üå¥ Manage Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx
Run any environment locally. Create a .env.ENVIRONMENT file and use --env-file to load it. It's straightforward, yet flexible.
$ echo "HELLO=production" > .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.production -- node index.js
Hello production
> ^^
or with multiple .env files
$ echo "HELLO=local" > .env.local
$ echo "HELLO=World" > .env
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.local --env-file=.env -- node index.js
Hello local
more environment examples
üöÄ Deploying
Use dotenvx.
Add encryption to your .env files with a single command. Pass the --encrypt flag.
$ dotenvx set HELLO Production --encrypt -f .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION="<.env.production private key>" dotenvx run -- node index.js
[dotenvx] injecting env (2) from .env.production
Hello Production

üìñ Documentation
Dotenv exposes four functions:

config
parse
populate
decrypt

Config
config will read your .env file, parse the contents, assign it to
process.env,
and return an Object with a parsed key containing the loaded content or an error key if it failed.
const result = dotenv.config()

if (result.error) {
  throw result.error
}

console.log(result.parsed)
You can additionally, pass options to config.
Options
path
Default: path.resolve(process.cwd(), '.env')
Specify a custom path if your file containing environment variables is located elsewhere.
require('dotenv').config({ path: '/custom/path/to/.env' })
By default, config will look for a file called .env in the current working directory.
Pass in multiple files as an array, and they will be parsed in order and combined with process.env (or option.processEnv, if set). The first value set for a variable will win, unless the options.override flag is set, in which case the last value set will win.  If a value already exists in process.env and the options.override flag is NOT set, no changes will be made to that value.
require('dotenv').config({ path: ['.env.local', '.env'] })
encoding
Default: utf8
Specify the encoding of your file containing environment variables.
require('dotenv').config({ encoding: 'latin1' })
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
require('dotenv').config({ debug: process.env.DEBUG })
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set on your machine with values from your .env file(s). If multiple files have been provided in option.path the override will also be used as each file is combined with the next. Without override being set, the first value wins. With override set the last value wins.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
processEnv
Default: process.env
Specify an object to write your environment variables to. Defaults to process.env environment variables.
const myObject = {}
require('dotenv').config({ processEnv: myObject })

console.log(myObject) // values from .env
console.log(process.env) // this was not changed or written to
Parse
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment
variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return
an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Options
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('hello world')
const opt = { debug: true }
const config = dotenv.parse(buf, opt)
// expect a debug message because the buffer is not in KEY=VAL form
Populate
The engine which populates the contents of your .env file to process.env is available for use. It accepts a target, a source, and options. This is useful for power users who want to supply their own objects.
For example, customizing the source:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'world' }

dotenv.populate(process.env, parsed)

console.log(process.env.HELLO) // world
For example, customizing the source AND target:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'universe' }
const target = { HELLO: 'world' } // empty object

dotenv.populate(target, parsed, { override: true, debug: true })

console.log(target) // { HELLO: 'universe' }
options
Debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being populated as you expect.
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set.
‚ùì FAQ
Why is the .env file not loading my environment variables successfully?
Most likely your .env file is not in the correct place. See this stack overflow.
Turn on debug mode and try again..
require('dotenv').config({ debug: true })
You will receive a helpful error outputted to your console.
Should I commit my .env file?
No. We strongly recommend against committing your .env file to version
control. It should only include environment-specific values such as database
passwords or API keys. Your production database should have a different
password than your development database.
Should I have multiple .env files?
We recommend creating one .env file per environment. Use .env for local/development, .env.production for production and so on. This still follows the twelve factor principles as each is attributed individually to its own environment. Avoid custom set ups that work in inheritance somehow (.env.production inherits values form .env for example). It is better to duplicate values if necessary across each .env.environment file.

In a twelve-factor app, env vars are granular controls, each fully orthogonal to other env vars. They are never grouped together as ‚Äúenvironments‚Äù, but instead are independently managed for each deploy. This is a model that scales up smoothly as the app naturally expands into more deploys over its lifetime.
‚Äì The Twelve-Factor App

What rules does the parsing engine follow?
The parsing engine currently supports the following rules:

BASIC=basic becomes {BASIC: 'basic'}
empty lines are skipped
lines beginning with # are treated as comments
# marks the beginning of a comment (unless when the value is wrapped in quotes)
empty values become empty strings (EMPTY= becomes {EMPTY: ''})
inner quotes are maintained (think JSON) (JSON={"foo": "bar"} becomes {JSON:"{\"foo\": \"bar\"}")
whitespace is removed from both ends of unquoted values (see more on trim) (FOO=  some value   becomes {FOO: 'some value'})
single and double quoted values are escaped (SINGLE_QUOTE='quoted' becomes {SINGLE_QUOTE: "quoted"})
single and double quoted values maintain whitespace from both ends (FOO="  some value  " becomes {FOO: '  some value  '})
double quoted values expand new lines (MULTILINE="new\nline" becomes

{MULTILINE: 'new
line'}


backticks are supported (BACKTICK_KEY=`This has 'single' and "double" quotes inside of it.`)

What happens to environment variables that were already set?
By default, we will never modify any environment variables that have already been set. In particular, if there is a variable in your .env file which collides with one that already exists in your environment, then that variable will be skipped.
If instead, you want to override process.env use the override option.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
How come my environment variables are not showing up for React?
Your React code is run in Webpack, where the fs module or even the process global itself are not accessible out-of-the-box. process.env can only be injected through Webpack configuration.
If you are using react-scripts, which is distributed through create-react-app, it has dotenv built in but with a quirk. Preface your environment variables with REACT_APP_. See this stack overflow for more details.
If you are using other frameworks (e.g. Next.js, Gatsby...), you need to consult their documentation for how to inject environment variables into the client.
Can I customize/write plugins for dotenv?
Yes! dotenv.config() returns an object representing the parsed .env file. This gives you everything you need to continue setting values on process.env. For example:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const variableExpansion = require('dotenv-expand')
const myEnv = dotenv.config()
variableExpansion(myEnv)
How do I use dotenv with import?
Simply..
// index.mjs (ESM)
import 'dotenv/config' // see https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#how-do-i-use-dotenv-with-import
import express from 'express'
A little background..

When you run a module containing an import declaration, the modules it imports are loaded first, then each module body is executed in a depth-first traversal of the dependency graph, avoiding cycles by skipping anything already executed.
‚Äì ES6 In Depth: Modules

What does this mean in plain language? It means you would think the following would work but it won't.
errorReporter.mjs:
class Client {
  constructor (apiKey) {
    console.log('apiKey', apiKey)

    this.apiKey = apiKey
  }
}

export default new Client(process.env.API_KEY)
index.mjs:
// Note: this is INCORRECT and will not work
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv'
dotenv.config()

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs' // process.env.API_KEY will be blank!
process.env.API_KEY will be blank.
Instead, index.mjs should be written as..
import 'dotenv/config'

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs'
Does that make sense? It's a bit unintuitive, but it is how importing of ES6 modules work. Here is a working example of this pitfall.
There are two alternatives to this approach:

Preload dotenv: node --require dotenv/config index.js (Note: you do not need to import dotenv with this approach)
Create a separate file that will execute config first as outlined in this comment on #133

Why am I getting the error Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'crypto|os|path'?
You are using dotenv on the front-end and have not included a polyfill. Webpack < 5 used to include these for you. Do the following:
npm install node-polyfill-webpack-plugin
Configure your webpack.config.js to something like the following.
require('dotenv').config()

const path = require('path');
const webpack = require('webpack')

const NodePolyfillPlugin = require('node-polyfill-webpack-plugin')

module.exports = {
  mode: 'development',
  entry: './src/index.ts',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  plugins: [
    new NodePolyfillPlugin(),
    new webpack.DefinePlugin({
      'process.env': {
        HELLO: JSON.stringify(process.env.HELLO)
      }
    }),
  ]
};
Alternatively, just use dotenv-webpack which does this and more behind the scenes for you.
What about variable expansion?
Try dotenv-expand
What about syncing and securing .env files?
Use dotenvx
What if I accidentally commit my .env file to code?
Remove it, remove git history and then install the git pre-commit hook to prevent this from ever happening again.
brew install dotenvx/brew/dotenvx
dotenvx precommit --install

How can I prevent committing my .env file to a Docker build?
Use the docker prebuild hook.
# Dockerfile
...
RUN curl -fsS https://dotenvx.sh/ | sh
...
RUN dotenvx prebuild
CMD ["dotenvx", "run", "--", "node", "index.js"]

dotenv-expand 

Dotenv-expand adds variable expansion on top of dotenv. If you find yourself needing to expand environment variables already existing on your machine, then dotenv-expand is your tool.



Install
# Install locally (recommended)
npm install dotenv-expand --save
Or installing with yarn? yarn add dotenv-expand
Usage
Create a .env file in the root of your project:
PASSWORD="s1mpl3"
DB_PASS=$PASSWORD
As early as possible in your application, import and configure dotenv and then expand dotenv:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const dotenvExpand = require('dotenv-expand')

dotenvExpand.expand(dotenv.config())

console.log(process.env) // remove this after you've confirmed it is expanding
That's it. process.env now has the expanded keys and values you defined in your .env file.
dotenvExpand.expand(dotenv.config())

...

connectdb(process.env.DB_PASS)

Preload

Note: Consider using dotenvx instead of preloading. I am now doing (and recommending) so.
It serves the same purpose (you do not need to require and load dotenv), has built-in expansion support, adds better debugging, and works with ANY language, framework, or platform. ‚Äì motdotla

You can use the --require (-r) command line option to preload dotenv & dotenv-expand. By doing this, you do not need to require and load dotenv or dotenv-expand in your application code. This is the preferred approach when using import instead of require.
$ node -r dotenv-expand/config your_script.js
The configuration options below are supported as command line arguments in the format dotenv_config_<option>=value
$ node -r dotenv-expand/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/your/env/vars
Additionally, you can use environment variables to set configuration options. Command line arguments will precede these.
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_<OPTION>=value node -r dotenv-expand/config your_script.js
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_ENCODING=latin1 node -r dotenv-expand/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env
Examples
See tests/.env.test for simple and complex examples of variable expansion in your .env
file.
Documentation
dotenv-expand exposes one function:

expand

Expand
expand will expand your environment variables.
const env = {
  parsed: {
    BASIC: 'basic',
    BASIC_EXPAND: '${BASIC}',
    BASIC_EXPAND_SIMPLE: '$BASIC'
  }
}

console.log(dotenvExpand.expand(env))
Options
processEnv
Default: process.env
Specify an object to write your secrets to. Defaults to process.env environment variables.
const myEnv = {}
const env = {
  processEnv: myEnv,
  parsed: {
    HELLO: 'World'
  }
}
dotenvExpand.expand(env)

console.log(myEnv.HELLO) // World
console.log(process.env.HELLO) // undefined
FAQ
What rules does the expansion engine follow?
See a full list of rules here.
How can I avoid expanding pre-existing envs (already in my process.env, for example pas$word)?
As of v12.0.0 dotenv-expand no longer expands process.env.
If you need this ability, use dotenvx by shipping an encrypted .env file with your code - allowing safe expansion at runtime.
How can I override an existing environment variable?
Use dotenvx as dotenv-expand does not support this.
dotenv-expand is a separate module (without knowledge of the loading of process.env and the .env file) and so cannot reliably know what to override.

dotenv 

Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology.

üå± Install
npm install dotenv --save
You can also use an npm-compatible package manager like yarn or bun:
yarn add dotenv
# or
bun add dotenv
üèóÔ∏è Usage






Create a .env file in the root of your project (if using a monorepo structure like apps/backend/app.js, put it in the root of the folder where your app.js process runs):
S3_BUCKET="YOURS3BUCKET"
SECRET_KEY="YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE"
As early as possible in your application, import and configure dotenv:
require('dotenv').config()
console.log(process.env) // remove this after you've confirmed it is working
.. or using ES6?
import 'dotenv/config'
That's it. process.env now has the keys and values you defined in your .env file:
require('dotenv').config()
// or import 'dotenv/config' if you're using ES6

...

s3.getBucketCors({Bucket: process.env.S3_BUCKET}, function(err, data) {})
Multiline values
If you need multiline variables, for example private keys, those are now supported (>= v15.0.0) with line breaks:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
...
Kh9NV...
...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
Alternatively, you can double quote strings and use the \n character:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nKh9NV...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
Comments
Comments may be added to your file on their own line or inline:
# This is a comment
SECRET_KEY=YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE # comment
SECRET_HASH="something-with-a-#-hash"
Comments begin where a # exists, so if your value contains a # please wrap it in quotes. This is a breaking change from >= v15.0.0 and on.
Parsing
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Preload

Note: Consider using dotenvx instead of preloading. I am now doing (and recommending) so.
It serves the same purpose (you do not need to require and load dotenv), adds better debugging, and works with ANY language, framework, or platform. ‚Äì motdotla

You can use the --require (-r) command line option to preload dotenv. By doing this, you do not need to require and load dotenv in your application code.
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
The configuration options below are supported as command line arguments in the format dotenv_config_<option>=value
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env dotenv_config_debug=true
Additionally, you can use environment variables to set configuration options. Command line arguments will precede these.
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_<OPTION>=value node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_ENCODING=latin1 DOTENV_CONFIG_DEBUG=true node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env
Variable Expansion
You need to add the value of another variable in one of your variables? Use dotenv-expand.
Command Substitution
Use dotenvx to use command substitution.
Add the output of a command to one of your variables in your .env file.
# .env
DATABASE_URL="postgres://$(whoami)@localhost/my_database"
// index.js
console.log('DATABASE_URL', process.env.DATABASE_URL)
$ dotenvx run --debug -- node index.js
[dotenvx@0.14.1] injecting env (1) from .env
DATABASE_URL postgres://yourusername@localhost/my_database
Syncing
You need to keep .env files in sync between machines, environments, or team members? Use dotenvx to encrypt your .env files and safely include them in source control. This still subscribes to the twelve-factor app rules by generating a decryption key separate from code.
Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx to generate .env.ci, .env.production files, and more.
Deploying
You need to deploy your secrets in a cloud-agnostic manner? Use dotenvx to generate a private decryption key that is set on your production server.
üå¥ Manage Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx
Run any environment locally. Create a .env.ENVIRONMENT file and use --env-file to load it. It's straightforward, yet flexible.
$ echo "HELLO=production" > .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.production -- node index.js
Hello production
> ^^
or with multiple .env files
$ echo "HELLO=local" > .env.local
$ echo "HELLO=World" > .env
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.local --env-file=.env -- node index.js
Hello local

üöÄ Deploying
Use dotenvx.
Add encryption to your .env files with a single command. Pass the --encrypt flag.
$ dotenvx set HELLO Production --encrypt -f .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION="<.env.production private key>" dotenvx run -- node index.js

üìñ Documentation
Dotenv exposes four functions:

config
parse
populate
decrypt

Config
config will read your .env file, parse the contents, assign it to
process.env,
and return an Object with a parsed key containing the loaded content or an error key if it failed.
const result = dotenv.config()

if (result.error) {
  throw result.error
}

console.log(result.parsed)
You can additionally, pass options to config.
Options
path
Default: path.resolve(process.cwd(), '.env')
Specify a custom path if your file containing environment variables is located elsewhere.
require('dotenv').config({ path: '/custom/path/to/.env' })
By default, config will look for a file called .env in the current working directory.
Pass in multiple files as an array, and they will be parsed in order and combined with process.env (or option.processEnv, if set). The first value set for a variable will win, unless the options.override flag is set, in which case the last value set will win.  If a value already exists in process.env and the options.override flag is NOT set, no changes will be made to that value.
require('dotenv').config({ path: ['.env.local', '.env'] })
encoding
Default: utf8
Specify the encoding of your file containing environment variables.
require('dotenv').config({ encoding: 'latin1' })
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
require('dotenv').config({ debug: process.env.DEBUG })
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set on your machine with values from your .env file(s). If multiple files have been provided in option.path the override will also be used as each file is combined with the next. Without override being set, the first value wins. With override set the last value wins.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
processEnv
Default: process.env
Specify an object to write your environment variables to. Defaults to process.env environment variables.
const myObject = {}
require('dotenv').config({ processEnv: myObject })

console.log(myObject) // values from .env
console.log(process.env) // this was not changed or written to
Parse
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment
variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return
an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Options
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('hello world')
const opt = { debug: true }
const config = dotenv.parse(buf, opt)
// expect a debug message because the buffer is not in KEY=VAL form
Populate
The engine which populates the contents of your .env file to process.env is available for use. It accepts a target, a source, and options. This is useful for power users who want to supply their own objects.
For example, customizing the source:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'world' }

dotenv.populate(process.env, parsed)

console.log(process.env.HELLO) // world
For example, customizing the source AND target:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'universe' }
const target = { HELLO: 'world' } // empty object

dotenv.populate(target, parsed, { override: true, debug: true })

console.log(target) // { HELLO: 'universe' }
options
Debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being populated as you expect.
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set.
‚ùì FAQ
Why is the .env file not loading my environment variables successfully?
Most likely your .env file is not in the correct place. See this stack overflow.
Turn on debug mode and try again..
require('dotenv').config({ debug: true })
You will receive a helpful error outputted to your console.
Should I commit my .env file?
No. We strongly recommend against committing your .env file to version
control. It should only include environment-specific values such as database
passwords or API keys. Your production database should have a different
password than your development database.
Should I have multiple .env files?
We recommend creating one .env file per environment. Use .env for local/development, .env.production for production and so on. This still follows the twelve factor principles as each is attributed individually to its own environment. Avoid custom set ups that work in inheritance somehow (.env.production inherits values form .env for example). It is better to duplicate values if necessary across each .env.environment file.

In a twelve-factor app, env vars are granular controls, each fully orthogonal to other env vars. They are never grouped together as ‚Äúenvironments‚Äù, but instead are independently managed for each deploy. This is a model that scales up smoothly as the app naturally expands into more deploys over its lifetime.
‚Äì The Twelve-Factor App

What rules does the parsing engine follow?
The parsing engine currently supports the following rules:

BASIC=basic becomes {BASIC: 'basic'}
empty lines are skipped
lines beginning with # are treated as comments
# marks the beginning of a comment (unless when the value is wrapped in quotes)
empty values become empty strings (EMPTY= becomes {EMPTY: ''})
inner quotes are maintained (think JSON) (JSON={"foo": "bar"} becomes {JSON:"{\"foo\": \"bar\"}")
whitespace is removed from both ends of unquoted values (see more on trim) (FOO=  some value   becomes {FOO: 'some value'})
single and double quoted values are escaped (SINGLE_QUOTE='quoted' becomes {SINGLE_QUOTE: "quoted"})
single and double quoted values maintain whitespace from both ends (FOO="  some value  " becomes {FOO: '  some value  '})
double quoted values expand new lines (MULTILINE="new\nline" becomes

{MULTILINE: 'new
line'}


backticks are supported (BACKTICK_KEY=`This has 'single' and "double" quotes inside of it.`)

What happens to environment variables that were already set?
By default, we will never modify any environment variables that have already been set. In particular, if there is a variable in your .env file which collides with one that already exists in your environment, then that variable will be skipped.
If instead, you want to override process.env use the override option.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
How come my environment variables are not showing up for React?
Your React code is run in Webpack, where the fs module or even the process global itself are not accessible out-of-the-box. process.env can only be injected through Webpack configuration.
If you are using react-scripts, which is distributed through create-react-app, it has dotenv built in but with a quirk. Preface your environment variables with REACT_APP_. See this stack overflow for more details.
If you are using other frameworks (e.g. Next.js, Gatsby...), you need to consult their documentation for how to inject environment variables into the client.
Can I customize/write plugins for dotenv?
Yes! dotenv.config() returns an object representing the parsed .env file. This gives you everything you need to continue setting values on process.env. For example:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const variableExpansion = require('dotenv-expand')
const myEnv = dotenv.config()
variableExpansion(myEnv)
How do I use dotenv with import?
Simply..
// index.mjs (ESM)
import 'dotenv/config' // see https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#how-do-i-use-dotenv-with-import
import express from 'express'
A little background..

When you run a module containing an import declaration, the modules it imports are loaded first, then each module body is executed in a depth-first traversal of the dependency graph, avoiding cycles by skipping anything already executed.
‚Äì ES6 In Depth: Modules

What does this mean in plain language? It means you would think the following would work but it won't.
errorReporter.mjs:
class Client {
  constructor (apiKey) {
    console.log('apiKey', apiKey)

    this.apiKey = apiKey
  }
}

export default new Client(process.env.API_KEY)
index.mjs:
// Note: this is INCORRECT and will not work
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv'
dotenv.config()

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs' // process.env.API_KEY will be blank!
process.env.API_KEY will be blank.
Instead, index.mjs should be written as..
import 'dotenv/config'

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs'
Does that make sense? It's a bit unintuitive, but it is how importing of ES6 modules work. Here is a working example of this pitfall.
There are two alternatives to this approach:

Preload dotenv: node --require dotenv/config index.js (Note: you do not need to import dotenv with this approach)
Create a separate file that will execute config first as outlined in this comment on #133

Why am I getting the error Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'crypto|os|path'?
You are using dotenv on the front-end and have not included a polyfill. Webpack < 5 used to include these for you. Do the following:
npm install node-polyfill-webpack-plugin
Configure your webpack.config.js to something like the following.
require('dotenv').config()

const path = require('path');
const webpack = require('webpack')

const NodePolyfillPlugin = require('node-polyfill-webpack-plugin')

module.exports = {
  mode: 'development',
  entry: './src/index.ts',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  plugins: [
    new NodePolyfillPlugin(),
    new webpack.DefinePlugin({
      'process.env': {
        HELLO: JSON.stringify(process.env.HELLO)
      }
    }),
  ]
};
Alternatively, just use dotenv-webpack which does this and more behind the scenes for you.
What about variable expansion?
Try dotenv-expand
What about syncing and securing .env files?
Use dotenvx
What if I accidentally commit my .env file to code?
Remove it, remove git history and then install the git pre-commit hook to prevent this from ever happening again.
brew install dotenvx/brew/dotenvx
dotenvx precommit --install

How can I prevent committing my .env file to a Docker build?
Use the docker prebuild hook.
# Dockerfile
...
RUN curl -fsS https://dotenvx.sh/ | sh
...
RUN dotenvx prebuild
CMD ["dotenvx", "run", "--", "node", "index.js"]

dotenv 

Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology.

üå± Install
npm install dotenv --save
You can also use an npm-compatible package manager like yarn or bun:
yarn add dotenv
# or
bun add dotenv
üèóÔ∏è Usage






Create a .env file in the root of your project (if using a monorepo structure like apps/backend/app.js, put it in the root of the folder where your app.js process runs):
S3_BUCKET="YOURS3BUCKET"
SECRET_KEY="YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE"
As early as possible in your application, import and configure dotenv:
require('dotenv').config()
console.log(process.env) // remove this after you've confirmed it is working
.. or using ES6?
import 'dotenv/config'
That's it. process.env now has the keys and values you defined in your .env file:
require('dotenv').config()
// or import 'dotenv/config' if you're using ES6

...

s3.getBucketCors({Bucket: process.env.S3_BUCKET}, function(err, data) {})
Multiline values
If you need multiline variables, for example private keys, those are now supported (>= v15.0.0) with line breaks:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
...
Kh9NV...
...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
Alternatively, you can double quote strings and use the \n character:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nKh9NV...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
Comments
Comments may be added to your file on their own line or inline:
# This is a comment
SECRET_KEY=YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE # comment
SECRET_HASH="something-with-a-#-hash"
Comments begin where a # exists, so if your value contains a # please wrap it in quotes. This is a breaking change from >= v15.0.0 and on.
Parsing
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Preload

Note: Consider using dotenvx instead of preloading. I am now doing (and recommending) so.
It serves the same purpose (you do not need to require and load dotenv), adds better debugging, and works with ANY language, framework, or platform. ‚Äì motdotla

You can use the --require (-r) command line option to preload dotenv. By doing this, you do not need to require and load dotenv in your application code.
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
The configuration options below are supported as command line arguments in the format dotenv_config_<option>=value
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env dotenv_config_debug=true
Additionally, you can use environment variables to set configuration options. Command line arguments will precede these.
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_<OPTION>=value node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_ENCODING=latin1 DOTENV_CONFIG_DEBUG=true node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env
Variable Expansion
You need to add the value of another variable in one of your variables? Use dotenv-expand.
Command Substitution
Use dotenvx to use command substitution.
Add the output of a command to one of your variables in your .env file.
# .env
DATABASE_URL="postgres://$(whoami)@localhost/my_database"
// index.js
console.log('DATABASE_URL', process.env.DATABASE_URL)
$ dotenvx run --debug -- node index.js

üìñ Documentation
Dotenv exposes four functions:

config
parse
populate
decrypt

Config
config will read your .env file, parse the contents, assign it to
process.env,
and return an Object with a parsed key containing the loaded content or an error key if it failed.
const result = dotenv.config()

if (result.error) {
  throw result.error
}

console.log(result.parsed)
You can additionally, pass options to config.
Options
path
Default: path.resolve(process.cwd(), '.env')
Specify a custom path if your file containing environment variables is located elsewhere.
require('dotenv').config({ path: '/custom/path/to/.env' })
By default, config will look for a file called .env in the current working directory.
Pass in multiple files as an array, and they will be parsed in order and combined with process.env (or option.processEnv, if set). The first value set for a variable will win, unless the options.override flag is set, in which case the last value set will win.  If a value already exists in process.env and the options.override flag is NOT set, no changes will be made to that value.
require('dotenv').config({ path: ['.env.local', '.env'] })
encoding
Default: utf8
Specify the encoding of your file containing environment variables.
require('dotenv').config({ encoding: 'latin1' })
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
require('dotenv').config({ debug: process.env.DEBUG })
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set on your machine with values from your .env file(s). If multiple files have been provided in option.path the override will also be used as each file is combined with the next. Without override being set, the first value wins. With override set the last value wins.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
processEnv
Default: process.env
Specify an object to write your environment variables to. Defaults to process.env environment variables.
const myObject = {}
require('dotenv').config({ processEnv: myObject })

console.log(myObject) // values from .env
console.log(process.env) // this was not changed or written to
Parse
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment
variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return
an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Options
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('hello world')
const opt = { debug: true }
const config = dotenv.parse(buf, opt)
// expect a debug message because the buffer is not in KEY=VAL form
Populate
The engine which populates the contents of your .env file to process.env is available for use. It accepts a target, a source, and options. This is useful for power users who want to supply their own objects.
For example, customizing the source:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'world' }

dotenv.populate(process.env, parsed)

console.log(process.env.HELLO) // world
For example, customizing the source AND target:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'universe' }
const target = { HELLO: 'world' } // empty object

dotenv.populate(target, parsed, { override: true, debug: true })

console.log(target) // { HELLO: 'universe' }
options
Debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being populated as you expect.
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set.
‚ùì FAQ
Why is the .env file not loading my environment variables successfully?
Most likely your .env file is not in the correct place. See this stack overflow.
Turn on debug mode and try again..
require('dotenv').config({ debug: true })
You will receive a helpful error outputted to your console.
Should I commit my .env file?
No. We strongly recommend against committing your .env file to version
control. It should only include environment-specific values such as database
passwords or API keys. Your production database should have a different
password than your development database.
Should I have multiple .env files?
We recommend creating one .env file per environment. Use .env for local/development, .env.production for production and so on. This still follows the twelve factor principles as each is attributed individually to its own environment. Avoid custom set ups that work in inheritance somehow (.env.production inherits values form .env for example). It is better to duplicate values if necessary across each .env.environment file.

In a twelve-factor app, env vars are granular controls, each fully orthogonal to other env vars. They are never grouped together as ‚Äúenvironments‚Äù, but instead are independently managed for each deploy. This is a model that scales up smoothly as the app naturally expands into more deploys over its lifetime.
‚Äì The Twelve-Factor App

What rules does the parsing engine follow?
The parsing engine currently supports the following rules:

BASIC=basic becomes {BASIC: 'basic'}
empty lines are skipped
lines beginning with # are treated as comments
# marks the beginning of a comment (unless when the value is wrapped in quotes)
empty values become empty strings (EMPTY= becomes {EMPTY: ''})
inner quotes are maintained (think JSON) (JSON={"foo": "bar"} becomes {JSON:"{\"foo\": \"bar\"}")
whitespace is removed from both ends of unquoted values (see more on trim) (FOO=  some value   becomes {FOO: 'some value'})
single and double quoted values are escaped (SINGLE_QUOTE='quoted' becomes {SINGLE_QUOTE: "quoted"})
single and double quoted values maintain whitespace from both ends (FOO="  some value  " becomes {FOO: '  some value  '})
double quoted values expand new lines (MULTILINE="new\nline" becomes

{MULTILINE: 'new
line'}


backticks are supported (BACKTICK_KEY=`This has 'single' and "double" quotes inside of it.`)

What happens to environment variables that were already set?
By default, we will never modify any environment variables that have already been set. In particular, if there is a variable in your .env file which collides with one that already exists in your environment, then that variable will be skipped.
If instead, you want to override process.env use the override option.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
How come my environment variables are not showing up for React?
Your React code is run in Webpack, where the fs module or even the process global itself are not accessible out-of-the-box. process.env can only be injected through Webpack configuration.
If you are using react-scripts, which is distributed through create-react-app, it has dotenv built in but with a quirk. Preface your environment variables with REACT_APP_. See this stack overflow for more details.
If you are using other frameworks (e.g. Next.js, Gatsby...), you need to consult their documentation for how to inject environment variables into the client.
Can I customize/write plugins for dotenv?
Yes! dotenv.config() returns an object representing the parsed .env file. This gives you everything you need to continue setting values on process.env. For example:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const variableExpansion = require('dotenv-expand')
const myEnv = dotenv.config()
variableExpansion(myEnv)
How do I use dotenv with import?
Simply..
// index.mjs (ESM)
import 'dotenv/config' // see https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#how-do-i-use-dotenv-with-import
import express from 'express'
A little background..

When you run a module containing an import declaration, the modules it imports are loaded first, then each module body is executed in a depth-first traversal of the dependency graph, avoiding cycles by skipping anything already executed.
‚Äì ES6 In Depth: Modules

What does this mean in plain language? It means you would think the following would work but it won't.
errorReporter.mjs:
class Client {
  constructor (apiKey) {
    console.log('apiKey', apiKey)

    this.apiKey = apiKey
  }
}

export default new Client(process.env.API_KEY)
index.mjs:
// Note: this is INCORRECT and will not work
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv'
dotenv.config()

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs' // process.env.API_KEY will be blank!
process.env.API_KEY will be blank.
Instead, index.mjs should be written as..
import 'dotenv/config'

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs'
Does that make sense? It's a bit unintuitive, but it is how importing of ES6 modules work. Here is a working example of this pitfall.
There are two alternatives to this approach:

Preload dotenv: node --require dotenv/config index.js (Note: you do not need to import dotenv with this approach)
Create a separate file that will execute config first as outlined in this comment on #133

Why am I getting the error Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'crypto|os|path'?
You are using dotenv on the front-end and have not included a polyfill. Webpack < 5 used to include these for you. Do the following:
npm install node-polyfill-webpack-plugin
Configure your webpack.config.js to something like the following.
require('dotenv').config()

const path = require('path');
const webpack = require('webpack')

const NodePolyfillPlugin = require('node-polyfill-webpack-plugin')

module.exports = {
  mode: 'development',
  entry: './src/index.ts',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  plugins: [
    new NodePolyfillPlugin(),
    new webpack.DefinePlugin({
      'process.env': {
        HELLO: JSON.stringify(process.env.HELLO)
      }
    }),
  ]
};
Alternatively, just use dotenv-webpack which does this and more behind the scenes for you.
What about variable expansion?
Try dotenv-expand
What about syncing and securing .env files?
Use dotenvx
What if I accidentally commit my .env file to code?
Remove it, remove git history and then install the git pre-commit hook to prevent this from ever happening again.
brew install dotenvx/brew/dotenvx
dotenvx precommit --install

How can I prevent committing my .env file to a Docker build?
Use the docker prebuild hook.
# Dockerfile
...
RUN curl -fsS https://dotenvx.sh/ | sh
...
RUN dotenvx prebuild
CMD ["dotenvx", "run", "--", "node", "index.js"]

dotenv 

Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology.

üå± Install
npm install dotenv --save
You can also use an npm-compatible package manager like yarn or bun:
yarn add dotenv
# or
bun add dotenv
üèóÔ∏è Usage






Create a .env file in the root of your project (if using a monorepo structure like apps/backend/app.js, put it in the root of the folder where your app.js process runs):
S3_BUCKET="YOURS3BUCKET"
SECRET_KEY="YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE"
As early as possible in your application, import and configure dotenv:
require('dotenv').config()
console.log(process.env) // remove this after you've confirmed it is working
.. or using ES6?
import 'dotenv/config'
That's it. process.env now has the keys and values you defined in your .env file:
require('dotenv').config()
// or import 'dotenv/config' if you're using ES6

...

s3.getBucketCors({Bucket: process.env.S3_BUCKET}, function(err, data) {})
Multiline values
If you need multiline variables, for example private keys, those are now supported (>= v15.0.0) with line breaks:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
...
Kh9NV...
...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
Alternatively, you can double quote strings and use the \n character:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nKh9NV...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
Comments
Comments may be added to your file on their own line or inline:
# This is a comment
SECRET_KEY=YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE # comment
SECRET_HASH="something-with-a-#-hash"
Comments begin where a # exists, so if your value contains a # please wrap it in quotes. This is a breaking change from >= v15.0.0 and on.
Parsing
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Preload

Note: Consider using dotenvx instead of preloading. I am now doing (and recommending) so.
It serves the same purpose (you do not need to require and load dotenv), adds better debugging, and works with ANY language, framework, or platform. ‚Äì motdotla

You can use the --require (-r) command line option to preload dotenv. By doing this, you do not need to require and load dotenv in your application code.
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
The configuration options below are supported as command line arguments in the format dotenv_config_<option>=value
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env dotenv_config_debug=true
Additionally, you can use environment variables to set configuration options. Command line arguments will precede these.
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_<OPTION>=value node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_ENCODING=latin1 DOTENV_CONFIG_DEBUG=true node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env
Variable Expansion
You need to add the value of another variable in one of your variables? Use dotenv-expand.
Command Substitution
Use dotenvx to use command substitution.
Add the output of a command to one of your variables in your .env file.
# .env
DATABASE_URL="postgres://$(whoami)@localhost/my_database"
// index.js
console.log('DATABASE_URL', process.env.DATABASE_URL)
$ dotenvx run --debug -- node index.js
[dotenvx@0.14.1] injecting env (1) from .env
DATABASE_URL postgres://yourusername@localhost/my_database
Syncing
You need to keep .env files in sync between machines, environments, or team members? Use dotenvx to encrypt your .env files and safely include them in source control. This still subscribes to the twelve-factor app rules by generating a decryption key separate from code.
Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx to generate .env.ci, .env.production files, and more.
Deploying
You need to deploy your secrets in a cloud-agnostic manner? Use dotenvx to generate a private decryption key that is set on your production server.
üå¥ Manage Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx
Run any environment locally. Create a .env.ENVIRONMENT file and use --env-file to load it. It's straightforward, yet flexible.
$ echo "HELLO=production" > .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.production -- node index.js
Hello production
> ^^
or with multiple .env files
$ echo "HELLO=local" > .env.local
$ echo "HELLO=World" > .env
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.local --env-file=.env -- node index.js
Hello local
more environment examples
üöÄ Deploying
Use dotenvx.
Add encryption to your .env files with a single command. Pass the --encrypt flag.
$ dotenvx set HELLO Production --encrypt -f .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION="<.env.production private key>" dotenvx run -- node index.js
[dotenvx] injecting env (2) from .env.production
Hello Production

üìñ Documentation
Dotenv exposes four functions:

config
parse
populate
decrypt

Config
config will read your .env file, parse the contents, assign it to
process.env,
and return an Object with a parsed key containing the loaded content or an error key if it failed.
const result = dotenv.config()

if (result.error) {
  throw result.error
}

console.log(result.parsed)
You can additionally, pass options to config.
Options
path
Default: path.resolve(process.cwd(), '.env')
Specify a custom path if your file containing environment variables is located elsewhere.
require('dotenv').config({ path: '/custom/path/to/.env' })
By default, config will look for a file called .env in the current working directory.
Pass in multiple files as an array, and they will be parsed in order and combined with process.env (or option.processEnv, if set). The first value set for a variable will win, unless the options.override flag is set, in which case the last value set will win.  If a value already exists in process.env and the options.override flag is NOT set, no changes will be made to that value.
require('dotenv').config({ path: ['.env.local', '.env'] })
encoding
Default: utf8
Specify the encoding of your file containing environment variables.
require('dotenv').config({ encoding: 'latin1' })
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
require('dotenv').config({ debug: process.env.DEBUG })
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set on your machine with values from your .env file(s). If multiple files have been provided in option.path the override will also be used as each file is combined with the next. Without override being set, the first value wins. With override set the last value wins.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
processEnv
Default: process.env
Specify an object to write your environment variables to. Defaults to process.env environment variables.
const myObject = {}
require('dotenv').config({ processEnv: myObject })

console.log(myObject) // values from .env
console.log(process.env) // this was not changed or written to
Parse
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment
variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return
an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Options
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('hello world')
const opt = { debug: true }
const config = dotenv.parse(buf, opt)
// expect a debug message because the buffer is not in KEY=VAL form
Populate
The engine which populates the contents of your .env file to process.env is available for use. It accepts a target, a source, and options. This is useful for power users who want to supply their own objects.
For example, customizing the source:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'world' }

dotenv.populate(process.env, parsed)

console.log(process.env.HELLO) // world
For example, customizing the source AND target:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'universe' }
const target = { HELLO: 'world' } // empty object

dotenv.populate(target, parsed, { override: true, debug: true })

console.log(target) // { HELLO: 'universe' }
options
Debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being populated as you expect.
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set.

If you are using other frameworks (e.g. Next.js, Gatsby...), you need to consult their documentation for how to inject environment variables into the client.
Can I customize/write plugins for dotenv?
Yes! dotenv.config() returns an object representing the parsed .env file. This gives you everything you need to continue setting values on process.env. For example:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const variableExpansion = require('dotenv-expand')
const myEnv = dotenv.config()
variableExpansion(myEnv)
How do I use dotenv with import?
Simply..
// index.mjs (ESM)
import 'dotenv/config' // see https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#how-do-i-use-dotenv-with-import
import express from 'express'
A little background..

When you run a module containing an import declaration, the modules it imports are loaded first, then each module body is executed in a depth-first traversal of the dependency graph, avoiding cycles by skipping anything already executed.
‚Äì ES6 In Depth: Modules

What does this mean in plain language? It means you would think the following would work but it won't.
errorReporter.mjs:
class Client {
  constructor (apiKey) {
    console.log('apiKey', apiKey)

    this.apiKey = apiKey
  }
}

export default new Client(process.env.API_KEY)
index.mjs:
// Note: this is INCORRECT and will not work
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv'
dotenv.config()

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs' // process.env.API_KEY will be blank!
process.env.API_KEY will be blank.
Instead, index.mjs should be written as..
import 'dotenv/config'

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs'
Does that make sense? It's a bit unintuitive, but it is how importing of ES6 modules work. Here is a working example of this pitfall.
There are two alternatives to this approach:

Preload dotenv: node --require dotenv/config index.js (Note: you do not need to import dotenv with this approach)
Create a separate file that will execute config first as outlined in this comment on #133

Why am I getting the error Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'crypto|os|path'?
You are using dotenv on the front-end and have not included a polyfill. Webpack < 5 used to include these for you. Do the following:
npm install node-polyfill-webpack-plugin
Configure your webpack.config.js to something like the following.
require('dotenv').config()

const path = require('path');
const webpack = require('webpack')

const NodePolyfillPlugin = require('node-polyfill-webpack-plugin')

module.exports = {
  mode: 'development',
  entry: './src/index.ts',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  plugins: [
    new NodePolyfillPlugin(),
    new webpack.DefinePlugin({
      'process.env': {
        HELLO: JSON.stringify(process.env.HELLO)
      }
    }),
  ]
};
Alternatively, just use dotenv-webpack which does this and more behind the scenes for you.
What about variable expansion?
Try dotenv-expand
What about syncing and securing .env files?
Use dotenvx
What if I accidentally commit my .env file to code?
Remove it, remove git history and then install the git pre-commit hook to prevent this from ever happening again.
brew install dotenvx/brew/dotenvx
dotenvx precommit --install

How can I prevent committing my .env file to a Docker build?
Use the docker prebuild hook.
# Dockerfile
...
RUN curl -fsS https://dotenvx.sh/ | sh
...
RUN dotenvx prebuild
CMD ["dotenvx", "run", "--", "node", "index.js"]

dotenv 

Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology.

üå± Install
npm install dotenv --save
You can also use an npm-compatible package manager like yarn or bun:
yarn add dotenv
# or
bun add dotenv
üèóÔ∏è Usage






Create a .env file in the root of your project (if using a monorepo structure like apps/backend/app.js, put it in the root of the folder where your app.js process runs):
S3_BUCKET="YOURS3BUCKET"
SECRET_KEY="YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE"
As early as possible in your application, import and configure dotenv:
require('dotenv').config()
console.log(process.env) // remove this after you've confirmed it is working
.. or using ES6?
import 'dotenv/config'
That's it. process.env now has the keys and values you defined in your .env file:
require('dotenv').config()
// or import 'dotenv/config' if you're using ES6

...

s3.getBucketCors({Bucket: process.env.S3_BUCKET}, function(err, data) {})
Multiline values
If you need multiline variables, for example private keys, those are now supported (>= v15.0.0) with line breaks:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
...
Kh9NV...
...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
Alternatively, you can double quote strings and use the \n character:
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nKh9NV...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
Comments
Comments may be added to your file on their own line or inline:
# This is a comment
SECRET_KEY=YOURSECRETKEYGOESHERE # comment
SECRET_HASH="something-with-a-#-hash"
Comments begin where a # exists, so if your value contains a # please wrap it in quotes. This is a breaking change from >= v15.0.0 and on.
Parsing
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Preload

Note: Consider using dotenvx instead of preloading. I am now doing (and recommending) so.
It serves the same purpose (you do not need to require and load dotenv), adds better debugging, and works with ANY language, framework, or platform. ‚Äì motdotla

You can use the --require (-r) command line option to preload dotenv. By doing this, you do not need to require and load dotenv in your application code.
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
The configuration options below are supported as command line arguments in the format dotenv_config_<option>=value
$ node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env dotenv_config_debug=true
Additionally, you can use environment variables to set configuration options. Command line arguments will precede these.
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_<OPTION>=value node -r dotenv/config your_script.js
$ DOTENV_CONFIG_ENCODING=latin1 DOTENV_CONFIG_DEBUG=true node -r dotenv/config your_script.js dotenv_config_path=/custom/path/to/.env
Variable Expansion
You need to add the value of another variable in one of your variables? Use dotenv-expand.
Command Substitution
Use dotenvx to use command substitution.
Add the output of a command to one of your variables in your .env file.
# .env
DATABASE_URL="postgres://$(whoami)@localhost/my_database"
// index.js
console.log('DATABASE_URL', process.env.DATABASE_URL)
$ dotenvx run --debug -- node index.js
[dotenvx@0.14.1] injecting env (1) from .env
DATABASE_URL postgres://yourusername@localhost/my_database
Syncing
You need to keep .env files in sync between machines, environments, or team members? Use dotenvx to encrypt your .env files and safely include them in source control. This still subscribes to the twelve-factor app rules by generating a decryption key separate from code.
Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx to generate .env.ci, .env.production files, and more.
Deploying
You need to deploy your secrets in a cloud-agnostic manner? Use dotenvx to generate a private decryption key that is set on your production server.
üå¥ Manage Multiple Environments
Use dotenvx
Run any environment locally. Create a .env.ENVIRONMENT file and use --env-file to load it. It's straightforward, yet flexible.
$ echo "HELLO=production" > .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.production -- node index.js
Hello production
> ^^
or with multiple .env files
$ echo "HELLO=local" > .env.local
$ echo "HELLO=World" > .env
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ dotenvx run --env-file=.env.local --env-file=.env -- node index.js
Hello local
more environment examples
üöÄ Deploying
Use dotenvx.
Add encryption to your .env files with a single command. Pass the --encrypt flag.
$ dotenvx set HELLO Production --encrypt -f .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" > index.js

$ DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION="<.env.production private key>" dotenvx run -- node index.js
[dotenvx] injecting env (2) from .env.production
Hello Production

üìñ Documentation
Dotenv exposes four functions:

config
parse
populate
decrypt

Config
config will read your .env file, parse the contents, assign it to
process.env,
and return an Object with a parsed key containing the loaded content or an error key if it failed.
const result = dotenv.config()

if (result.error) {
  throw result.error
}

console.log(result.parsed)
You can additionally, pass options to config.
Options
path
Default: path.resolve(process.cwd(), '.env')
Specify a custom path if your file containing environment variables is located elsewhere.
require('dotenv').config({ path: '/custom/path/to/.env' })
By default, config will look for a file called .env in the current working directory.
Pass in multiple files as an array, and they will be parsed in order and combined with process.env (or option.processEnv, if set). The first value set for a variable will win, unless the options.override flag is set, in which case the last value set will win.  If a value already exists in process.env and the options.override flag is NOT set, no changes will be made to that value.
require('dotenv').config({ path: ['.env.local', '.env'] })
encoding
Default: utf8
Specify the encoding of your file containing environment variables.
require('dotenv').config({ encoding: 'latin1' })
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
require('dotenv').config({ debug: process.env.DEBUG })
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set on your machine with values from your .env file(s). If multiple files have been provided in option.path the override will also be used as each file is combined with the next. Without override being set, the first value wins. With override set the last value wins.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
processEnv
Default: process.env
Specify an object to write your environment variables to. Defaults to process.env environment variables.
const myObject = {}
require('dotenv').config({ processEnv: myObject })

console.log(myObject) // values from .env
console.log(process.env) // this was not changed or written to
Parse
The engine which parses the contents of your file containing environment
variables is available to use. It accepts a String or Buffer and will return
an Object with the parsed keys and values.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('BASIC=basic')
const config = dotenv.parse(buf) // will return an object
console.log(typeof config, config) // object { BASIC : 'basic' }
Options
debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being set as you expect.
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const buf = Buffer.from('hello world')
const opt = { debug: true }
const config = dotenv.parse(buf, opt)
// expect a debug message because the buffer is not in KEY=VAL form
Populate
The engine which populates the contents of your .env file to process.env is available for use. It accepts a target, a source, and options. This is useful for power users who want to supply their own objects.
For example, customizing the source:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'world' }

dotenv.populate(process.env, parsed)

console.log(process.env.HELLO) // world
For example, customizing the source AND target:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const parsed = { HELLO: 'universe' }
const target = { HELLO: 'world' } // empty object

dotenv.populate(target, parsed, { override: true, debug: true })

console.log(target) // { HELLO: 'universe' }
options
Debug
Default: false
Turn on logging to help debug why certain keys or values are not being populated as you expect.
override
Default: false
Override any environment variables that have already been set.
‚ùì FAQ
Why is the .env file not loading my environment variables successfully?
Most likely your .env file is not in the correct place. See this stack overflow.
Turn on debug mode and try again..
require('dotenv').config({ debug: true })
You will receive a helpful error outputted to your console.
Should I commit my .env file?
No. We strongly recommend against committing your .env file to version
control. It should only include environment-specific values such as database
passwords or API keys. Your production database should have a different
password than your development database.
Should I have multiple .env files?
We recommend creating one .env file per environment. Use .env for local/development, .env.production for production and so on. This still follows the twelve factor principles as each is attributed individually to its own environment. Avoid custom set ups that work in inheritance somehow (.env.production inherits values form .env for example). It is better to duplicate values if necessary across each .env.environment file.

In a twelve-factor app, env vars are granular controls, each fully orthogonal to other env vars. They are never grouped together as ‚Äúenvironments‚Äù, but instead are independently managed for each deploy. This is a model that scales up smoothly as the app naturally expands into more deploys over its lifetime.
‚Äì The Twelve-Factor App

What rules does the parsing engine follow?
The parsing engine currently supports the following rules:

BASIC=basic becomes {BASIC: 'basic'}
empty lines are skipped
lines beginning with # are treated as comments
# marks the beginning of a comment (unless when the value is wrapped in quotes)
empty values become empty strings (EMPTY= becomes {EMPTY: ''})
inner quotes are maintained (think JSON) (JSON={"foo": "bar"} becomes {JSON:"{\"foo\": \"bar\"}")
whitespace is removed from both ends of unquoted values (see more on trim) (FOO=  some value   becomes {FOO: 'some value'})
single and double quoted values are escaped (SINGLE_QUOTE='quoted' becomes {SINGLE_QUOTE: "quoted"})
single and double quoted values maintain whitespace from both ends (FOO="  some value  " becomes {FOO: '  some value  '})
double quoted values expand new lines (MULTILINE="new\nline" becomes

{MULTILINE: 'new
line'}


backticks are supported (BACKTICK_KEY=`This has 'single' and "double" quotes inside of it.`)

What happens to environment variables that were already set?
By default, we will never modify any environment variables that have already been set. In particular, if there is a variable in your .env file which collides with one that already exists in your environment, then that variable will be skipped.
If instead, you want to override process.env use the override option.
require('dotenv').config({ override: true })
How come my environment variables are not showing up for React?
Your React code is run in Webpack, where the fs module or even the process global itself are not accessible out-of-the-box. process.env can only be injected through Webpack configuration.
If you are using react-scripts, which is distributed through create-react-app, it has dotenv built in but with a quirk. Preface your environment variables with REACT_APP_. See this stack overflow for more details.
If you are using other frameworks (e.g. Next.js, Gatsby...), you need to consult their documentation for how to inject environment variables into the client.
Can I customize/write plugins for dotenv?
Yes! dotenv.config() returns an object representing the parsed .env file. This gives you everything you need to continue setting values on process.env. For example:
const dotenv = require('dotenv')
const variableExpansion = require('dotenv-expand')
const myEnv = dotenv.config()
variableExpansion(myEnv)
How do I use dotenv with import?
Simply..
// index.mjs (ESM)
import 'dotenv/config' // see https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#how-do-i-use-dotenv-with-import
import express from 'express'
A little background..

When you run a module containing an import declaration, the modules it imports are loaded first, then each module body is executed in a depth-first traversal of the dependency graph, avoiding cycles by skipping anything already executed.
‚Äì ES6 In Depth: Modules

What does this mean in plain language? It means you would think the following would work but it won't.
errorReporter.mjs:
class Client {
  constructor (apiKey) {
    console.log('apiKey', apiKey)

    this.apiKey = apiKey
  }
}

export default new Client(process.env.API_KEY)
index.mjs:
// Note: this is INCORRECT and will not work
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv'
dotenv.config()

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs' // process.env.API_KEY will be blank!
process.env.API_KEY will be blank.
Instead, index.mjs should be written as..
import 'dotenv/config'

import errorReporter from './errorReporter.mjs'
Does that make sense? It's a bit unintuitive, but it is how importing of ES6 modules work. Here is a working example of this pitfall.
There are two alternatives to this approach:

Preload dotenv: node --require dotenv/config index.js (Note: you do not need to import dotenv with this approach)
Create a separate file that will execute config first as outlined in this comment on #133

Why am I getting the error Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'crypto|os|path'?
You are using dotenv on the front-end and have not included a polyfill. Webpack < 5 used to include these for you. Do the following:
npm install node-polyfill-webpack-plugin
Configure your webpack.config.js to something like the following.
require('dotenv').config()

const path = require('path');
const webpack = require('webpack')

const NodePolyfillPlugin = require('node-polyfill-webpack-plugin')

module.exports = {
  mode: 'development',
  entry: './src/index.ts',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  plugins: [
    new NodePolyfillPlugin(),
    new webpack.DefinePlugin({
      'process.env': {
        HELLO: JSON.stringify(process.env.HELLO)
      }
    }),
  ]
};
Alternatively, just use dotenv-webpack which does this and more behind the scenes for you.
