ascii-art.js




Images, fonts, tables, ansi styles and compositing in Node.js & the browser. 100% JS.  (What is ASCII-Art?)
In the beginning there was colors.js but in the fine tradition of vendors calling out a problem they have the solution to, chalk was introduced. In that same vein, I offer ascii-art as an update, expansion and generalization of MooAsciiArt and at the same time it can replace your existing ansi colors library.
It features support for Images, Styles, Tables, Graphs and Figlet Fonts as well as handling multi-line joining and compositing automatically.
Why would I use this?
 [click to expand/close] 

modular - small set of purpose built modules all interacting through a common ansi library.
color profiles support - other libraries mostly assume you are running x11.
no prototype manipulation - No String.prototype usage. No __proto__ usage. No BS.
handles the ugly intersection of multiline text and ansi codes for you.
runs in the browser and Node.js (CommonJS, AMD, globals, webpack, or webcomponents)
Other libraries out there do too little, focus on logging and have inconsistent ANSI handling *.
JS + Canvas No binaries... we are 100% JS, with a common code path in browser and server †.
It works like a package manager for figlet fonts.
flexible output Supports 4bit, 8bit and 32bit output
Supports your existing API We allow you to use the colors.js/chalk API or our own ‡.
* - Example: Style text, then put it in a table. It displays based on it's ansi string width, but balances cell widths based on the string width, leading to crazy looking output.

† - This allows us plug into averaging, distance and other logic dynamically, in powerful ways (In node this renders in cairo, via a Canvas shim)

‡ - while both have fluent apis we use a grid and are asynchronous, which enables large image processing and complex compositing scenarios, whereas the chalk API focuses on immediate string mutations




Installation

ascii-art supports many usage styles, but the different use cases require slightly different installations. If you have any questions, please ask.

 In Code 
    npm install --save ascii-art

 CLI 
    npm install -g ascii-art
or (Beta):
    npm install -g ascii-art-cl

 Web 
    npm install --save ascii-art-webcomponents

Call Style

All chains in ascii-art can be called in one of 3 ways. In this example we change "Some Text" to be formatted using the doom.flf font.

 Callback 
    art.font("Some Text", 'doom', (err, rendered)=>{
        //if err, err is the error that occured
        //if !err rendered is the ascii
    });

 Promise 
    art.font("Some Text", 'doom')
       .then((rendered)=>{
           //rendered is the ascii
       })).catch((err)=>{
           //err is an error
       }));

 Await 
    try{
        let rendered = await art.font("Some Text", 'doom').completed()
        //rendered is the ascii
    }catch(err){
        //err is an error
    }

Styles
Add ANSI styles to a string and return the result.

Change "Some Text" to be formatted with ansi codes for green (then have the colors reset at the end of the string)

 JS 
    art.style("Some Text", 'green', true) //returns String

 CL 
    ascii-art text -s green "Some Text"

 Web 
    <ascii-art-style
		style="green"
	>Some Text</ascii-art-style>

Styles are: italic, bold, underline, |framed|, |encircled|, overline, blink and  inverse . And available colors are:
Colors
Color defaults to 8 bit (most compatible), to enable other modes set booleans in the options:

is256 : compute the color using 256colors, as defined by ansi256. Note that full color output may need to tune the difference method to obtain optimal results.
isTrueColor : do not constrain color and directly output RGB to the console.

Color Tables may be found in the style documentation
Fonts
Render a string using a figlet font and add that to the buffer. There is a batch version of this function which does not chain and takes an array( .strings()).

Change "Some Text" to be formatted using the doom.flf font, which it will load from the predefined location (defaults to /Fonts)

 JS 
    art.font("Some Text", 'doom', true) //returns String

 CL 
    ascii-art font -F doom "Some Text"

 Web 
    <ascii-art-font
		font="doom"
	>Some Text</ascii-art-font>

Outputs
______                          _
|  _  \                        | |
| | | |  ___  _ __ ___    ___  | |
| | | | / _ \| '_ ` _ \  / _ \ | |
| |/ / |  __/| | | | | || (_) ||_|
|___/   \___||_| |_| |_| \___/ (_)

UTF Fonts
If you use UTF fonts(Which are part of your system fonts) your output looks more like:
 or  by using u:<utf font name> where the font names are: default, script, script+bold, gothic, gothic+bold, serif+bold+italic, serif+bold, serif+italic, monospace, sansserif, sansserif+bold+italic, sansserif+bold, sansserif+italic, doublestrike
Check out the documentation for more examples!
Images
Create an image from the passed image and append that to the buffer

This takes myImage.jpg, converts the colors to ansi backgrounds and then stipples the details at a threshold of 40 (of 255) using a higher resolution image and then renders that into a braille overlay in black(#000000) on top of the colors.

 JS 
    art.image({
        src: "myImage.jpg",
        rows:80,
        cols:80,
        stipple:"#000000",
        posterize: true,
        threshold:40
    }, cb)

 CL 
    ascii-art image posterized stippled
        --rows=80 --cols=80 --stipple="#000000"
        --threshold=40 myImage.jpg

 Web 
    <ascii-art-image
        src="myImage.jpg"
        rows="80" cols="80"
        stipple="#000000"
        posterize
        threshold="40"
    ></ascii-art-image>

There are some options that are available which are not in the image core, they are:


lineart : A boolean option which outputs lineart using block characters (which may be colored with stroke and customized with threshold(0-255)).  Example 


stipple : A boolean option which outputs lineart using braille characters (which may be colored with stroke and customized with threshold(0-255)).  Example 


posterize : Use stipple on top of colored backgrounds to retain as much detail as possible.  Example 


blended : Use posterize with both lineart and braille at relative thresholds to each other. Example 



Downsampling and detail loss
Because of the resolution downsampling from the original dimensions to the destination width, some finer details may be lost. Plan accordingly. Here's an example of some sequential art in 256 color (primarily greyscale):
 Example 

 JS 
var art = require('ascii-art');
var Color = require('ascii-art-ansi/colors');
Color.is256 = true;
art.image({
    src: "node_modules/ascii-art/Images/grendel.jpg",
    alphabet:"blocks"
}, cb);

 CL 
    ascii-art image
        -B 8
        -C rankedChannel
        -a blocks
        node_modules/ascii-art/Images/grendel.jpg

 Web 
    <!-- todo -->

 

Color Modes
Multiple output modes are available including 4bit, 8bit, 32bit (equivalent to 24bit). 16bit color was intentionally excluded, as there is no direct terminal support and the cost of including color definitions for such a large set would not be justified. It would be feasible to implement as an optional import, should the need exist.
The following example takes zero-cool.jpg, converts the colors to ansi foreground color in solid block characters. Note that you will need to tune your distance function in 8bit mode, as what looks good varies by the type of imagery that goes through it.
Anecdotally, the default distance function only covers ~1/3 of the samples we've done, but we support many methods(euclideanDistance, classic, ratioDistance, classicByValue, CIE76Difference, closestByIntensity, rankedChannel, simple, minDeviation, luminosity, saturation, hue, original). But helpfully, you can merge algorithms by asking for algorithm1+algorithm2 (it uses equal weighting), or make your own.

Artwork[Non-Functional]
Fetch a graphic from a remote source and append it to the current buffer, which is not enabled by default. You must add a request compatible library by either setting the ENV variable ASCII_ART_REQUEST_MODULE or by setting it manually with art.setRequest(requestModule)

Fetch artwork from the requested source using the preconfigured request library.

 JS 
    art.artwork({}, cb) //returns String

 CL 
    # N/A

 Web 
    <!--N/A -->

Often I use this in conjunction with an image backdrop, for example to superimpose bones on the earth:

Compositing
We also support combining all these nifty elements you've made into a single composition, via a few functions available on the chains (.lines(), .overlay(), .border(), .strip() and .join()). Maybe I've got A BBS wall I want to have some dynamic info on.. I could make that with this

Check out the documentation for detailed examples!
Compatibility
If you're a chalk user, just use var chalk = require('ascii-art/kaolin'); in place of your existing chalk references (Much of color.js, too... since chalk is a subset of colors.js). No migration needed, keep using the wacky syntax you are used to(In this mode, refer to their docs, not mine).
Users of ascii-table will also note that interface is supported via require('ascii-art').Table, though our solution is ansi-aware, lazy rendering and better at sizing columns.
I may support the other colors stuff (extras & themes) eventually, but it's currently a low priority.
Roadmap
Goals

Re-enable .artwork()
Bring karma current, deprecate phantomjs
artwork source standard
Better Docs
value reversal (light vs dark)
HTML output
piping support on the command line
ATASCII art support
ANSI art support
PETSCII art support
2 colors per char with multisampling
Graph enhancements
REPL

Non Goals

realtime: videos, curses, etc.:
logging integration

Testing
In the root directory run:
npm run test

which runs the test suite directly. In order to test it in Chrome try:
npm run browser-test

In order to run the chalk test, use:
npm run chalk-test

Deprecations

.artwork() is currently non-functional while we enable an open-plugin standard, which will arrive shortly. When it does, you'll be able to plug any number of fetch solutions in, which hopefully matches whatever you currently bundle.
.toPromise() is now deprecated in favor of .completed() and will be removed when 3.x arrives
up to this point all files are UMD wrapped and may be used without modification in node(even old versions), the browser and via browser build systems. when 3.x arrives, the UMD versions may be part of an independent build process, while the mainline browser and node versions may continue to be uniform. If you have opinions on this, I'd like to hear them.

Development
How to dev : the simple version

fork ascii-art
git clone git@github.com:<YOUR GITHUB USERNAME>/ascii-art.git
go into the checked out module cd ascii-art
execute ./test/dev_setup.sh (this will install a number of dependencies in the parent directory)

How to dev : a better version

Fork all the ascii-art-modules(ascii-art-image, ascii-art-ansi, ascii-art-braille, ascii-art-docs, ascii-art-font, ascii-art-utf, ascii-art-graph, ascii-art-table), along with the root module.
git clone git@github.com:<YOUR GITHUB USERNAME>/ascii-art.git
go into the checked out module cd ascii-art
./dev_setup.sh <YOUR GITHUB USERNAME>
commit to your own branches master, then submit PRs from that to the master branch of the main repo.

After setup, run npm test to make sure everything is working correctly.
Note various modern editions of npm nuke links each time package-lock.json is written (which, depending on your settings, may be every new dependency you add). This can be remedied by executing npx module-auto-link -c 'npm-auto-link' in the module in question, which will restore it's links.
Please make sure to run the tests before submitting a patch and report any rough edges. Thanks!
Enjoy,

Installation

ascii-art supports many usage styles, but the different use cases require slightly different installations. If you have any questions, please ask.

 In Code 
    npm install --save ascii-art

 CLI 
    npm install -g ascii-art
or (Beta):
    npm install -g ascii-art-cl

 Web 
    npm install --save ascii-art-webcomponents

Call Style

All chains in ascii-art can be called in one of 3 ways. In this example we change "Some Text" to be formatted using the doom.flf font.

 Callback 
    art.font("Some Text", 'doom', (err, rendered)=>{
        //if err, err is the error that occured
        //if !err rendered is the ascii
    });

 Promise 
    art.font("Some Text", 'doom')
       .then((rendered)=>{
           //rendered is the ascii
       })).catch((err)=>{
           //err is an error
       }));

 Await 
    try{
        let rendered = await art.font("Some Text", 'doom').completed()
        //rendered is the ascii
    }catch(err){
        //err is an error
    }

Styles
Add ANSI styles to a string and return the result.

Change "Some Text" to be formatted with ansi codes for green (then have the colors reset at the end of the string)

 JS 
    art.style("Some Text", 'green', true) //returns String

 CL 
    ascii-art text -s green "Some Text"

 Web 
    <ascii-art-style
		style="green"
	>Some Text</ascii-art-style>

Styles are: italic, bold, underline, |framed|, |encircled|, overline, blink and  inverse . And available colors are:
Colors
Color defaults to 8 bit (most compatible), to enable other modes set booleans in the options:

is256 : compute the color using 256colors, as defined by ansi256. Note that full color output may need to tune the difference method to obtain optimal results.
isTrueColor : do not constrain color and directly output RGB to the console.

Color Tables may be found in the style documentation
Fonts
Render a string using a figlet font and add that to the buffer. There is a batch version of this function which does not chain and takes an array( .strings()).

Images
Create an image from the passed image and append that to the buffer

This takes myImage.jpg, converts the colors to ansi backgrounds and then stipples the details at a threshold of 40 (of 255) using a higher resolution image and then renders that into a braille overlay in black(#000000) on top of the colors.

 JS 
    art.image({
        src: "myImage.jpg",
        rows:80,
        cols:80,
        stipple:"#000000",
        posterize: true,
        threshold:40
    }, cb)

 CL 
    ascii-art image posterized stippled
        --rows=80 --cols=80 --stipple="#000000"

 Web 
    <ascii-art-image
        src="myImage.jpg"

        stipple="#000000"
        posterize
        threshold="40"
    ></ascii-art-image>

There are some options that are available which are not in the image core, they are:


lineart : A boolean option which outputs lineart using block characters (which may be colored with stroke and customized with threshold(0-255)).  Example 


stipple : A boolean option which outputs lineart using braille characters (which may be colored with stroke and customized with threshold(0-255)).  Example 


posterize : Use stipple on top of colored backgrounds to retain as much detail as possible.  Example 


blended : Use posterize with both lineart and braille at relative thresholds to each other. Example 



Downsampling and detail loss
Because of the resolution downsampling from the original dimensions to the destination width, some finer details may be lost. Plan accordingly. Here's an example of some sequential art in 256 color (primarily greyscale):
 Example 

 JS 
var art = require('ascii-art');
var Color = require('ascii-art-ansi/colors');
Color.is256 = true;
art.image({
    src: "node_modules/ascii-art/Images/grendel.jpg",
    alphabet:"blocks"
}, cb);

Color Modes
Multiple output modes are available including 4bit, 8bit, 32bit (equivalent to 24bit). 16bit color was intentionally excluded, as there is no direct terminal support and the cost of including color definitions for such a large set would not be justified. It would be feasible to implement as an optional import, should the need exist.
The following example takes zero-cool.jpg, converts the colors to ansi foreground color in solid block characters. Note that you will need to tune your distance function in 8bit mode, as what looks good varies by the type of imagery that goes through it.
Anecdotally, the default distance function only covers ~1/3 of the samples we've done, but we support many methods(euclideanDistance, classic, ratioDistance, classicByValue, CIE76Difference, closestByIntensity, rankedChannel, simple, minDeviation, luminosity, saturation, hue, original). But helpfully, you can merge algorithms by asking for algorithm1+algorithm2 (it uses equal weighting), or make your own.

Artwork[Non-Functional]
Fetch a graphic from a remote source and append it to the current buffer, which is not enabled by default. You must add a request compatible library by either setting the ENV variable ASCII_ART_REQUEST_MODULE or by setting it manually with art.setRequest(requestModule)

Fetch artwork from the requested source using the preconfigured request library.

 JS 
    art.artwork({}, cb) //returns String

 CL 
    # N/A

 Web 
    <!--N/A -->

Often I use this in conjunction with an image backdrop, for example to superimpose bones on the earth:

Compositing
We also support combining all these nifty elements you've made into a single composition, via a few functions available on the chains (.lines(), .overlay(), .border(), .strip() and .join()). Maybe I've got A BBS wall I want to have some dynamic info on.. I could make that with this

Check out the documentation for detailed examples!
Compatibility
If you're a chalk user, just use var chalk = require('ascii-art/kaolin'); in place of your existing chalk references (Much of color.js, too... since chalk is a subset of colors.js). No migration needed, keep using the wacky syntax you are used to(In this mode, refer to their docs, not mine).
Users of ascii-table will also note that interface is supported via require('ascii-art').Table, though our solution is ansi-aware, lazy rendering and better at sizing columns.
I may support the other colors stuff (extras & themes) eventually, but it's currently a low priority.
Roadmap
Goals

Re-enable .artwork()
Bring karma current, deprecate phantomjs
artwork source standard
Better Docs
value reversal (light vs dark)
HTML output
piping support on the command line
ATASCII art support
ANSI art support
PETSCII art support
2 colors per char with multisampling
Graph enhancements
REPL

Non Goals

realtime: videos, curses, etc.:
logging integration

Testing
In the root directory run:
npm run test

which runs the test suite directly. In order to test it in Chrome try:
npm run browser-test

In order to run the chalk test, use:
npm run chalk-test

Deprecations

.artwork() is currently non-functional while we enable an open-plugin standard, which will arrive shortly. When it does, you'll be able to plug any number of fetch solutions in, which hopefully matches whatever you currently bundle.
.toPromise() is now deprecated in favor of .completed() and will be removed when 3.x arrives
up to this point all files are UMD wrapped and may be used without modification in node(even old versions), the browser and via browser build systems. when 3.x arrives, the UMD versions may be part of an independent build process, while the mainline browser and node versions may continue to be uniform. If you have opinions on this, I'd like to hear them.

Development
How to dev : the simple version

fork ascii-art
git clone git@github.com:<YOUR GITHUB USERNAME>/ascii-art.git
go into the checked out module cd ascii-art
execute ./test/dev_setup.sh (this will install a number of dependencies in the parent directory)

How to dev : a better version

Fork all the ascii-art-modules(ascii-art-image, ascii-art-ansi, ascii-art-braille, ascii-art-docs, ascii-art-font, ascii-art-utf, ascii-art-graph, ascii-art-table), along with the root module.
git clone git@github.com:<YOUR GITHUB USERNAME>/ascii-art.git
go into the checked out module cd ascii-art
./dev_setup.sh <YOUR GITHUB USERNAME>
commit to your own branches master, then submit PRs from that to the master branch of the main repo.

After setup, run npm test to make sure everything is working correctly.
Note various modern editions of npm nuke links each time package-lock.json is written (which, depending on your settings, may be every new dependency you add). This can be remedied by executing npx module-auto-link -c 'npm-auto-link' in the module in question, which will restore it's links.
Please make sure to run the tests before submitting a patch and report any rough edges. Thanks!
Enjoy,

ascii-art.js




Images, fonts, tables, ansi styles and compositing in Node.js & the browser. 100% JS.  (What is ASCII-Art?)
In the beginning there was colors.js but in the fine tradition of vendors calling out a problem they have the solution to, chalk was introduced. In that same vein, I offer ascii-art as an update, expansion and generalization of MooAsciiArt and at the same time it can replace your existing ansi colors library.
It features support for Images, Styles, Tables, Graphs and Figlet Fonts as well as handling multi-line joining and compositing automatically.
Why would I use this?
 [click to expand/close] 

modular - small set of purpose built modules all interacting through a common ansi library.
color profiles support - other libraries mostly assume you are running x11.
no prototype manipulation - No String.prototype usage. No __proto__ usage. No BS.
handles the ugly intersection of multiline text and ansi codes for you.
runs in the browser and Node.js (CommonJS, AMD, globals, webpack, or webcomponents)
Other libraries out there do too little, focus on logging and have inconsistent ANSI handling *.
JS + Canvas No binaries... we are 100% JS, with a common code path in browser and server †.
It works like a package manager for figlet fonts.
flexible output Supports 4bit, 8bit and 32bit output
Supports your existing API We allow you to use the colors.js/chalk API or our own ‡.
* - Example: Style text, then put it in a table. It displays based on it's ansi string width, but balances cell widths based on the string width, leading to crazy looking output.

† - This allows us plug into averaging, distance and other logic dynamically, in powerful ways (In node this renders in cairo, via a Canvas shim)

‡ - while both have fluent apis we use a grid and are asynchronous, which enables large image processing and complex compositing scenarios, whereas the chalk API focuses on immediate string mutations




Installation

ascii-art supports many usage styles, but the different use cases require slightly different installations. If you have any questions, please ask.

 In Code 
    npm install --save ascii-art

 CLI 
    npm install -g ascii-art
or (Beta):
    npm install -g ascii-art-cl

 Web 
    npm install --save ascii-art-webcomponents

Call Style

All chains in ascii-art can be called in one of 3 ways. In this example we change "Some Text" to be formatted using the doom.flf font.

 Callback 
    art.font("Some Text", 'doom', (err, rendered)=>{
        //if err, err is the error that occured
        //if !err rendered is the ascii
    });

 Promise 
    art.font("Some Text", 'doom')
       .then((rendered)=>{
           //rendered is the ascii
       })).catch((err)=>{
           //err is an error
       }));

 Await 
    try{
        let rendered = await art.font("Some Text", 'doom').completed()
        //rendered is the ascii
    }catch(err){
        //err is an error
    }

Styles
Add ANSI styles to a string and return the result.

Change "Some Text" to be formatted with ansi codes for green (then have the colors reset at the end of the string)

 JS 
    art.style("Some Text", 'green', true) //returns String

 CL 
    ascii-art text -s green "Some Text"

 Web 
    <ascii-art-style
		style="green"
	>Some Text</ascii-art-style>

Styles are: italic, bold, underline, |framed|, |encircled|, overline, blink and  inverse . And available colors are:
Colors
Color defaults to 8 bit (most compatible), to enable other modes set booleans in the options:

is256 : compute the color using 256colors, as defined by ansi256. Note that full color output may need to tune the difference method to obtain optimal results.
isTrueColor : do not constrain color and directly output RGB to the console.

Color Tables may be found in the style documentation
Fonts
Render a string using a figlet font and add that to the buffer. There is a batch version of this function which does not chain and takes an array( .strings()).

Change "Some Text" to be formatted using the doom.flf font, which it will load from the predefined location (defaults to /Fonts)

 JS 
    art.font("Some Text", 'doom', true) //returns String

 CL 
    ascii-art font -F doom "Some Text"

 Web 
    <ascii-art-font
		font="doom"
	>Some Text</ascii-art-font>

Outputs

| | | | / _ \| '_ ` _ \  / _ \ | |
| |/ / |  __/| | | | | || (_) ||_|
|___/   \___||_| |_| |_| \___/ (_)

UTF Fonts
If you use UTF fonts(Which are part of your system fonts) your output looks more like:
 or  by using u:<utf font name> where the font names are: default, script, script+bold, gothic, gothic+bold, serif+bold+italic, serif+bold, serif+italic, monospace, sansserif, sansserif+bold+italic, sansserif+bold, sansserif+italic, doublestrike

        src: "myImage.jpg",
        rows:80,
        cols:80,
        stipple:"#000000",
        posterize: true,
        threshold:40
    }, cb)

 CL 
    ascii-art image posterized stippled
        --rows=80 --cols=80 --stipple="#000000"

        posterize
        threshold="40"
    ></ascii-art-image>

Artwork[Non-Functional]
Fetch a graphic from a remote source and append it to the current buffer, which is not enabled by default. You must add a request compatible library by either setting the ENV variable ASCII_ART_REQUEST_MODULE or by setting it manually with art.setRequest(requestModule)

Fetch artwork from the requested source using the preconfigured request library.

 JS 
    art.artwork({}, cb) //returns String

 CL 
    # N/A

 Web 
    <!--N/A -->

Often I use this in conjunction with an image backdrop, for example to superimpose bones on the earth:

Compositing
We also support combining all these nifty elements you've made into a single composition, via a few functions available on the chains (.lines(), .overlay(), .border(), .strip() and .join()). Maybe I've got A BBS wall I want to have some dynamic info on.. I could make that with this

Check out the documentation for detailed examples!
Compatibility
If you're a chalk user, just use var chalk = require('ascii-art/kaolin'); in place of your existing chalk references (Much of color.js, too... since chalk is a subset of colors.js). No migration needed, keep using the wacky syntax you are used to(In this mode, refer to their docs, not mine).
Users of ascii-table will also note that interface is supported via require('ascii-art').Table, though our solution is ansi-aware, lazy rendering and better at sizing columns.
I may support the other colors stuff (extras & themes) eventually, but it's currently a low priority.
Roadmap
Goals

Re-enable .artwork()
Bring karma current, deprecate phantomjs
artwork source standard
Better Docs
value reversal (light vs dark)
HTML output
piping support on the command line
ATASCII art support
ANSI art support
PETSCII art support
2 colors per char with multisampling
Graph enhancements
REPL

Non Goals

realtime: videos, curses, etc.:
logging integration

Testing
In the root directory run:
npm run test

which runs the test suite directly. In order to test it in Chrome try:
npm run browser-test

In order to run the chalk test, use:
npm run chalk-test

Deprecations

.artwork() is currently non-functional while we enable an open-plugin standard, which will arrive shortly. When it does, you'll be able to plug any number of fetch solutions in, which hopefully matches whatever you currently bundle.
.toPromise() is now deprecated in favor of .completed() and will be removed when 3.x arrives
up to this point all files are UMD wrapped and may be used without modification in node(even old versions), the browser and via browser build systems. when 3.x arrives, the UMD versions may be part of an independent build process, while the mainline browser and node versions may continue to be uniform. If you have opinions on this, I'd like to hear them.

Development
How to dev : the simple version

fork ascii-art
git clone git@github.com:<YOUR GITHUB USERNAME>/ascii-art.git
go into the checked out module cd ascii-art
execute ./test/dev_setup.sh (this will install a number of dependencies in the parent directory)

How to dev : a better version

Fork all the ascii-art-modules(ascii-art-image, ascii-art-ansi, ascii-art-braille, ascii-art-docs, ascii-art-font, ascii-art-utf, ascii-art-graph, ascii-art-table), along with the root module.
git clone git@github.com:<YOUR GITHUB USERNAME>/ascii-art.git
go into the checked out module cd ascii-art
./dev_setup.sh <YOUR GITHUB USERNAME>
commit to your own branches master, then submit PRs from that to the master branch of the main repo.

After setup, run npm test to make sure everything is working correctly.
Note various modern editions of npm nuke links each time package-lock.json is written (which, depending on your settings, may be every new dependency you add). This can be remedied by executing npx module-auto-link -c 'npm-auto-link' in the module in question, which will restore it's links.
Please make sure to run the tests before submitting a patch and report any rough edges. Thanks!
Enjoy,

ascii-art.js




Images, fonts, tables, ansi styles and compositing in Node.js & the browser. 100% JS.  (What is ASCII-Art?)
In the beginning there was colors.js but in the fine tradition of vendors calling out a problem they have the solution to, chalk was introduced. In that same vein, I offer ascii-art as an update, expansion and generalization of MooAsciiArt and at the same time it can replace your existing ansi colors library.
It features support for Images, Styles, Tables, Graphs and Figlet Fonts as well as handling multi-line joining and compositing automatically.
Why would I use this?
 [click to expand/close] 

modular - small set of purpose built modules all interacting through a common ansi library.
color profiles support - other libraries mostly assume you are running x11.
no prototype manipulation - No String.prototype usage. No __proto__ usage. No BS.
handles the ugly intersection of multiline text and ansi codes for you.
runs in the browser and Node.js (CommonJS, AMD, globals, webpack, or webcomponents)
Other libraries out there do too little, focus on logging and have inconsistent ANSI handling *.
JS + Canvas No binaries... we are 100% JS, with a common code path in browser and server †.
It works like a package manager for figlet fonts.
flexible output Supports 4bit, 8bit and 32bit output
Supports your existing API We allow you to use the colors.js/chalk API or our own ‡.
* - Example: Style text, then put it in a table. It displays based on it's ansi string width, but balances cell widths based on the string width, leading to crazy looking output.

† - This allows us plug into averaging, distance and other logic dynamically, in powerful ways (In node this renders in cairo, via a Canvas shim)

‡ - while both have fluent apis we use a grid and are asynchronous, which enables large image processing and complex compositing scenarios, whereas the chalk API focuses on immediate string mutations




Installation

ascii-art supports many usage styles, but the different use cases require slightly different installations. If you have any questions, please ask.

 In Code 
    npm install --save ascii-art

 CLI 
    npm install -g ascii-art
or (Beta):
    npm install -g ascii-art-cl

 Web 
    npm install --save ascii-art-webcomponents

Call Style

All chains in ascii-art can be called in one of 3 ways. In this example we change "Some Text" to be formatted using the doom.flf font.

 Callback 
    art.font("Some Text", 'doom', (err, rendered)=>{
        //if err, err is the error that occured
        //if !err rendered is the ascii
    });

 Promise 
    art.font("Some Text", 'doom')
       .then((rendered)=>{
           //rendered is the ascii
       })).catch((err)=>{
           //err is an error
       }));

 Await 
    try{
        let rendered = await art.font("Some Text", 'doom').completed()
        //rendered is the ascii
    }catch(err){
        //err is an error
    }

Styles
Add ANSI styles to a string and return the result.

Change "Some Text" to be formatted with ansi codes for green (then have the colors reset at the end of the string)

 JS 
    art.style("Some Text", 'green', true) //returns String

 CL 
    ascii-art text -s green "Some Text"

 Web 
    <ascii-art-style
		style="green"
	>Some Text</ascii-art-style>

Styles are: italic, bold, underline, |framed|, |encircled|, overline, blink and  inverse . And available colors are:
Colors
Color defaults to 8 bit (most compatible), to enable other modes set booleans in the options:

is256 : compute the color using 256colors, as defined by ansi256. Note that full color output may need to tune the difference method to obtain optimal results.
isTrueColor : do not constrain color and directly output RGB to the console.

Color Tables may be found in the style documentation
Fonts
Render a string using a figlet font and add that to the buffer. There is a batch version of this function which does not chain and takes an array( .strings()).

Change "Some Text" to be formatted using the doom.flf font, which it will load from the predefined location (defaults to /Fonts)

 JS 
    art.font("Some Text", 'doom', true) //returns String

 CL 
    ascii-art font -F doom "Some Text"

 Web 
    <ascii-art-font
		font="doom"
	>Some Text</ascii-art-font>

Outputs
______                          _
|  _  \                        | |
| | | |  ___  _ __ ___    ___  | |
| | | | / _ \| '_ ` _ \  / _ \ | |
| |/ / |  __/| | | | | || (_) ||_|
|___/   \___||_| |_| |_| \___/ (_)

UTF Fonts
If you use UTF fonts(Which are part of your system fonts) your output looks more like:
 or  by using u:<utf font name> where the font names are: default, script, script+bold, gothic, gothic+bold, serif+bold+italic, serif+bold, serif+italic, monospace, sansserif, sansserif+bold+italic, sansserif+bold, sansserif+italic, doublestrike
Check out the documentation for more examples!
Images
Create an image from the passed image and append that to the buffer

This takes myImage.jpg, converts the colors to ansi backgrounds and then stipples the details at a threshold of 40 (of 255) using a higher resolution image and then renders that into a braille overlay in black(#000000) on top of the colors.

 JS 
    art.image({
        src: "myImage.jpg",
        rows:80,
        cols:80,
        stipple:"#000000",
        posterize: true,
        threshold:40
    }, cb)

 CL 
    ascii-art image posterized stippled
        --rows=80 --cols=80 --stipple="#000000"
        --threshold=40 myImage.jpg

 Web 
    <ascii-art-image
        src="myImage.jpg"
        rows="80" cols="80"
        stipple="#000000"
        posterize
        threshold="40"
    ></ascii-art-image>

There are some options that are available which are not in the image core, they are:


lineart : A boolean option which outputs lineart using block characters (which may be colored with stroke and customized with threshold(0-255)).  Example 


stipple : A boolean option which outputs lineart using braille characters (which may be colored with stroke and customized with threshold(0-255)).  Example 


posterize : Use stipple on top of colored backgrounds to retain as much detail as possible.  Example 


blended : Use posterize with both lineart and braille at relative thresholds to each other. Example 



Downsampling and detail loss
Because of the resolution downsampling from the original dimensions to the destination width, some finer details may be lost. Plan accordingly. Here's an example of some sequential art in 256 color (primarily greyscale):
 Example 

 JS 
var art = require('ascii-art');
var Color = require('ascii-art-ansi/colors');
Color.is256 = true;
art.image({
    src: "node_modules/ascii-art/Images/grendel.jpg",
    alphabet:"blocks"
}, cb);

 CL 
    ascii-art image
        -B 8
        -C rankedChannel
        -a blocks
        node_modules/ascii-art/Images/grendel.jpg

 Web 
    <!-- todo -->

 

Color Modes
Multiple output modes are available including 4bit, 8bit, 32bit (equivalent to 24bit). 16bit color was intentionally excluded, as there is no direct terminal support and the cost of including color definitions for such a large set would not be justified. It would be feasible to implement as an optional import, should the need exist.
The following example takes zero-cool.jpg, converts the colors to ansi foreground color in solid block characters. Note that you will need to tune your distance function in 8bit mode, as what looks good varies by the type of imagery that goes through it.
Anecdotally, the default distance function only covers ~1/3 of the samples we've done, but we support many methods(euclideanDistance, classic, ratioDistance, classicByValue, CIE76Difference, closestByIntensity, rankedChannel, simple, minDeviation, luminosity, saturation, hue, original). But helpfully, you can merge algorithms by asking for algorithm1+algorithm2 (it uses equal weighting), or make your own.

Note various modern editions of npm nuke links each time package-lock.json is written (which, depending on your settings, may be every new dependency you add). This can be remedied by executing npx module-auto-link -c 'npm-auto-link' in the module in question, which will restore it's links.
Please make sure to run the tests before submitting a patch and report any rough edges. Thanks!
Enjoy,
-Abbey Hawk Sparrow

Backed by the leaders in AI, GitHub Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With GitHub Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on: value, innovation, and happiness.GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use GitHub Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, GitHub Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, student, faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead. 
What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains, and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create GitHub Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.To generate a code suggestion, the GitHub Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to GitHub Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the GitHub Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to GitHub Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, GitHub Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to GitHub Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.  What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with GitHub Copilot throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in GitHub Advanced Security.What if I do not want GitHub Copilot?GitHub Copilot is entirely optional and requires you to opt in before gaining access. You can easily configure its usage directly in the editor, enabling or disabling it at any time. Additionally, you have control over which file types GitHub Copilot is active for.How do I control access to GitHub Copilot in my company?Access to Copilot Business and Enterprise is managed by your GitHub Administrator. They can control access to preview features, models, and set GitHub Copilot policies for your organization. Additionally, you can use your network firewall to explicitly allow access to Copilot Business and/or block access to Copilot Pro or Free. For more details, refer to the documentation.Plans & pricingWhat are the differences between the Free, Pro, Business, and Enterprise plans?GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers.

The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.How can I upgrade my GitHub Copilot Free license to Copilot Pro?If you're on the Free plan, you can upgrade to Pro through your Copilot settings page or directly on the Copilot marketing page.What is included in GitHub Copilot Free?GitHub Copilot Free users are limited to 2000 completions and 50 chat requests (including Copilot Edits).Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in GitHub Advanced Security and available to all public repositories.PrivacyWhat personal data does GitHub Copilot process?GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:User Engagement Data: This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics. Prompts: These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions. Suggestions: These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts. Feedback Data: This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models. How does GitHub use the Copilot data?How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendationsTroubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-datenessEnhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operationalThese practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement (DPA), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers. GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:Billing and account managementTo comply with and resolve legal obligations For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of serviceTo generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentivesTo produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the GitHub Privacy Statement.How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers? If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows: Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:Prompts and Suggestions: Not retainedUser Engagement Data: Kept for two years.Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.All other GitHub Copilot access and use:Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions. Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a Data Protection Agreement that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals. How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the GitHub Privacy Statement.
Responsible AIWhat are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations. With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a code referencing feature as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or                        idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also                        synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that                        either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including hardcoded credentials, SQL injections, and path injections. Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective                        risk tolerances.As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment for more details.Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with                        disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our feedback forum.Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid                        synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter                        system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found here.Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.GeneralPlans & pricingPrivacyResponsible AIGeneralWhat is GitHub Copilot?GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, GitHub Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With GitHub Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on: value, innovation, and happiness.GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use GitHub Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, GitHub Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, student, faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead. 
What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains, and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create GitHub Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.To generate a code suggestion, the GitHub Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to GitHub Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the GitHub Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to GitHub Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, GitHub Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to GitHub Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.  What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers.

The types of personal data processed may include:User Engagement Data: This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics. Prompts: These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions. Suggestions: These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts. Feedback Data: This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models. How does GitHub use the Copilot data?How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendationsTroubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-datenessEnhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operationalThese practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement (DPA), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers. GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:Billing and account managementTo comply with and resolve legal obligations For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of serviceTo generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentivesTo produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the GitHub Privacy Statement.How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers? If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows: Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:Prompts and Suggestions: Not retainedUser Engagement Data: Kept for two years.Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.All other GitHub Copilot access and use:Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions. Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a Data Protection Agreement that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals. How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the GitHub Privacy Statement.
Responsible AIWhat are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations. With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a code referencing feature as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or                        idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also                        synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that                        either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including hardcoded credentials, SQL injections, and path injections. Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient.

The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment for more details.Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with                        disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our feedback forum.Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid                        synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter                        system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards.

Connect to your codespaces from the browser or locally using an IDE like Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ.How do I use Codespaces?There are a number of entry points to spin up a Codespaces environment, including:A template.Your repository for new feature workAn open pull request to explore work-in-progressA commit in the repository's history to investigate a bug at a specific point in timeVisual Studio CodeIn beta, can you also use your JetBrains IDE or JupyterLabLearn more about how to use Codespaces in our documentation.Is Codespaces available for individual developers?Codespaces is available for developers in every organization, and under the control of the organization who pays for the user's codespace. All personal (individual) GitHub.com accounts include a quota of free usage each month, which organizations can enable (see the next question) for their private and internal repositories. GitHub will provide users in the free plan 120 core hours or 60 hours of run time on a 2 core codespace, plus 15 GB of storage each month. See how it's balanced on the billing page.Is Codespaces available for teams and companies?Codespaces is available for teams and companies, but needs to be enabled first in an organization’s settings. Teams and companies can select which repositories and users have access to Codespaces for added security and permissioning control. Learn how to enable Codespaces in an organization in our docs.How much does Codespaces cost?Codespaces is free for individual use up to 60 hours a month and comes with simple, pay-as-you-go pricing after that. It’s also available for organizations with pay-as-you-go pricing and has pricing controls so any company or team can determine how much they want to spend a month.

“The new planning and tracking functionality keeps my project management close to my code. I no longer find myself needing to reach for spreadsheets or 3P tools which go stale instantly.Dan GodfreyDevelopment ManagerFlexible project planning for developers Start using projectsContact salesFrequently asked questionsWhat is GitHub Issues?We all need a way to plan our work, track issues, and discuss the things we build. Our answer to this universal question is GitHub Issues, and it’s built-in to every repository. GitHub’s issue tracking is unique because of our focus on simplicity, references, and elegant formatting.With GitHub Issues, you can express ideas with GitHub Flavored Markdown, assign and mention contributors, react with emojis, clarify with attachments and videos, plus reference code like commits, pull requests, and deploys. With task lists, you can break big issues into tasks, further organize your work with milestones and labels, and track relationships and dependencies.We built GitHub Issues for developers. It is simple, adaptable, and powerful.What are Projects?As teams and projects grow, how we work evolves. Tools that hard-code a methodology are too specific and rigid to adapt to any moment. Often, we find ourselves creating a spreadsheet or pulling out a notepad to have the space to think. Then our planning is disconnected from where the work happens.The new Projects connect your planning directly to the work your teams are doing and flexibly adapt to whatever your team needs at any point. Built like a spreadsheet, project tables give you a live canvas to filter, sort, and group issues and pull requests. You can use it, or the accompanying project board, along with custom fields, to track a sprint, plan a feature, or manage a large-scale release.What plans have access to Projects?All users have access to the free tier of GitHub Issues and Projects. For more information about paid tiers, see our pricing page.Will the new Projects experience be available in GitHub Enterprise Server?Yes!

          One of the big benefits of using GitHub for CI/CD and security automation is that we don’t have to build, deploy, or maintain additional tools because they’re built-in to GitHub. That means developers can spend less time managing tools and more time writing code, which is how they’d prefer to spend their time.

            About The ReadME Project
            Coding is usually seen as a solitary activity, but it’s actually the world’s largest community effort led by open source maintainers, contributors, and teams. These unsung heroes put in long hours to build software, fix issues, field questions, and manage communities.
            The ReadME Project is part of GitHub’s ongoing effort to amplify the voices of the developer community. It’s an evolving space to engage with the community and explore the stories, challenges, technology, and culture that surround the world of open source.

GitHub Copilot functionality works in code editors regardless of code hosting platform. Some features are enhanced with the use of GitHub because Copilot can directly draw context and knowledge from repositories, pull requests, issues, and other data structures in the GitHub platform.
Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models. 
Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations. With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a Data Protection Agreement that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.\n\n\n\nEnterprise

          I'd like to applaud our engineer for how he exceptionally responded to our query. This ticket was not a simple, one-answer investigation and I was very happy with how he explored multiple angles to investigate.

        What is escalation and incident management?

Additionally, Senior Escalation Engineers (SEEs) facilitate GitHub-internal technical communications and liaise with the rest of GitHub to improve the support team’s capability in similar future circumstances.

      GitHub Premium Support and GitHub Premium Plus Support customers have SLAs. For urgent priority tickets, your SLA guarantees a 30-minute initial response time, which includes troubleshooting. For high priority tickets, your SLA provides a four-hour initial response time.
      
    
  


    
  
    
      
      
        What’s included in initial troubleshooting?
      
    
    
      For initial troubleshooting, the assigned Premium Support Engineer/Customer Reliability Engineer will review and acknowledge your ticket. To better understand the issue and start troubleshooting, the engineer may ask for additional information such as screenshots, error messages, log files, diagnostics files, support bundles, or the output of specific console commands. They may also collaborate with others in support, engineering, or in the regional incident commander.
If a callback was requested, the engineer will determine if screen sharing is the most effective way to drive ticket resolution. If so, they will invite you to join a screen-sharing session.
      
    
  


    
  
    
      
      
        How do I get health check reports?
      
    
    
      GitHub Premium Support and GitHub Premium Plus Support customers are entitled to unlimited automated health check reports. Additionally, GitHub Premium Plus Support customers can request quarterly enhanced health checks with findings, interpretations, and recommendations from a Customer Reliability Engineer (CRE).
      
    
  


    
  
    
      
      
        What is crisis prevention?
      
    
    
      Crisis prevention allows GitHub Enterprise Server customers to prepare for — and experience — an incident without risk. Your Customer Reliability Engineer (CRE) guides your team through an incident simulation in a safe and controlled environment.
Crisis Prevention consists of up to four sessions about reliability best practices, preparing for a potential incident, and efficiently interacting with GitHub Support. After the incident simulation, your CRE will run a detailed retrospective, uncovering lessons learned and improvement suggestions for the future.
      
    
  


    
  
    
      
      
        How long does GitHub Premium Support take?
      
    
    
      GitHub Premium Support and GitHub Premium Plus Support Plus customers have service-level agreements (SLAs) for initial response. For urgent priority tickets, the initial response SLA guarantees a 30-minute initial response time, which includes troubleshooting. For high-priority tickets, the initial response SLA provides a four-hour time.
We currently do not provide estimates for time to resolution, as the complexity of tickets varies. However, we review these metrics on a regular basis and reduce times whenever possible.
      
    
  


    
  
    
      
      
        How do I resolve a problem in GitHub Enterprise?
      
    
    
      You can get support via online ticket submission if you’re using the basic plan included with your GitHub Enterprise license. If you have GitHub Premium Support or GitHub Premium Plus Support, you can submit a ticket online. For urgent tickets, GitHub Premium Support and GitHub Premium Plus Support customers can request a callback and have a screen-sharing session with one of our Premium Support Engineers or Customer Reliability Engineers (CREs). Please refer to our plan comparison table for more details.
      
    
  



          Rules and policies


    
  
    
      
      
        If I do not use all the technical advisory hours in a given quarter, can they be carried over?
      
    
    
      Premium Plus customers may use up to 12 technical advisory hours per quarter. Unused technical advisory hours may not be carried over into the next quarter.
      
    
  


    
  
    
      
      
        How can the technical advisory support hours be used? 
      
    
    
      There are multiple ways you can use technical advisory hours, including but not limited to:

Consultations regarding GitHub best practices and general recommendations
GitHub Enterprise Server upgrade preparation and assistance

      
    
  


    
  
    
      
      
        Does GitHub Premium Support provide service on weekends?

          Upgrading your plan


    
  
    
      
      
        What virtual trainings are available with GitHub Premium Plus Support and who can participate?
      
    
    
      Customers get access to one virtual training class per year. Topics include:

GitHub for developers

GitHub for admins (Cloud)
GitHub for non-developers
GH API Training
GH Actions Fundamentals
GH Actions Intermediate
GH Copilot Fundamentals
GH Copilot Intermediate
GH Copilot Administration & Security
GitHub Enterprise Implementation (Cloud)

We recommend limiting training sessions to a maximum of 16 participants to ensure an optimal provider-to-participant ratio and a high-quality delivery experience. However, in specific cases where it makes sense, we can accommodate up to 20–25 participants while maintaining our commitment to delivering a valuable training experience for your team.
      
    
  


    
  
    
      
      
        What value will I get by upgrading to GitHub Premium Plus Support?
      
    
    
      GitHub Premium Plus Support customers get an assigned Customer Reliability Engineer (CRE), quarterly enhanced health checks, access to crisis prevention, technical advisory hours, and many additional benefits, which you can review in our plan comparison table.
      
    
  


    
  
    
      
      
        What’s the benefit of having a Customer Reliability Engineer (CRE) over a Premium Support Engineer?
      
    
    
      A CRE knows your customer account in detail and can help you expedite case resolution faster than a Premium Support Engineer.
      
    
  


    
  
    
      
      
        Since I get GitHub Enterprise Support for free, why should I upgrade to GitHub Premium Support?
      
    
    
      Most customers upgrade to GitHub Premium Support because they need initial response SLAs for urgent and high priority requests, phone support, screen share support for critical issues, and health checks. To see a full list of features for GitHub Premium Support packages, please refer to our plan comparison table.

This is available in the EU and Australia with additional regions coming soon. Contact our sales team to learn more.

ascii-art.js




Images, fonts, tables, ansi styles and compositing in Node.js & the browser. 100% JS.  (What is ASCII-Art?)
In the beginning there was colors.js but in the fine tradition of vendors calling out a problem they have the solution to, chalk was introduced. In that same vein, I offer ascii-art as an update, expansion and generalization of MooAsciiArt and at the same time it can replace your existing ansi colors library.
It features support for Images, Styles, Tables, Graphs and Figlet Fonts as well as handling multi-line joining and compositing automatically.
Why would I use this?
 [click to expand/close] 

modular - small set of purpose built modules all interacting through a common ansi library.
color profiles support - other libraries mostly assume you are running x11.
no prototype manipulation - No String.prototype usage. No __proto__ usage. No BS.
handles the ugly intersection of multiline text and ansi codes for you.
runs in the browser and Node.js (CommonJS, AMD, globals, webpack, or webcomponents)
Other libraries out there do too little, focus on logging and have inconsistent ANSI handling *.
JS + Canvas No binaries... we are 100% JS, with a common code path in browser and server †.
It works like a package manager for figlet fonts.
flexible output Supports 4bit, 8bit and 32bit output
Supports your existing API We allow you to use the colors.js/chalk API or our own ‡.
* - Example: Style text, then put it in a table. It displays based on it's ansi string width, but balances cell widths based on the string width, leading to crazy looking output.

† - This allows us plug into averaging, distance and other logic dynamically, in powerful ways (In node this renders in cairo, via a Canvas shim)

‡ - while both have fluent apis we use a grid and are asynchronous, which enables large image processing and complex compositing scenarios, whereas the chalk API focuses on immediate string mutations




Installation

ascii-art supports many usage styles, but the different use cases require slightly different installations. If you have any questions, please ask.

 In Code 
    npm install --save ascii-art

 CLI 
    npm install -g ascii-art
or (Beta):
    npm install -g ascii-art-cl

 Web 
    npm install --save ascii-art-webcomponents

Call Style

All chains in ascii-art can be called in one of 3 ways. In this example we change "Some Text" to be formatted using the doom.flf font.

 Callback 
    art.font("Some Text", 'doom', (err, rendered)=>{
        //if err, err is the error that occured
        //if !err rendered is the ascii
    });

 Promise 
    art.font("Some Text", 'doom')
       .then((rendered)=>{
           //rendered is the ascii
       })).catch((err)=>{
           //err is an error
       }));

 Await 
    try{
        let rendered = await art.font("Some Text", 'doom').completed()
        //rendered is the ascii
    }catch(err){
        //err is an error
    }

Styles
Add ANSI styles to a string and return the result.

Change "Some Text" to be formatted with ansi codes for green (then have the colors reset at the end of the string)

 JS 
    art.style("Some Text", 'green', true) //returns String

 CL 
    ascii-art text -s green "Some Text"

 Web 
    <ascii-art-style
		style="green"
	>Some Text</ascii-art-style>

Styles are: italic, bold, underline, |framed|, |encircled|, overline, blink and  inverse . And available colors are:
Colors
Color defaults to 8 bit (most compatible), to enable other modes set booleans in the options:

is256 : compute the color using 256colors, as defined by ansi256. Note that full color output may need to tune the difference method to obtain optimal results.
isTrueColor : do not constrain color and directly output RGB to the console.

Color Tables may be found in the style documentation
Fonts
Render a string using a figlet font and add that to the buffer. There is a batch version of this function which does not chain and takes an array( .strings()).

Change "Some Text" to be formatted using the doom.flf font, which it will load from the predefined location (defaults to /Fonts)

 JS 
    art.font("Some Text", 'doom', true) //returns String

 CL 
    ascii-art font -F doom "Some Text"

 Web 
    <ascii-art-font
		font="doom"
	>Some Text</ascii-art-font>

Outputs

UTF Fonts
If you use UTF fonts(Which are part of your system fonts) your output looks more like:
 or  by using u:<utf font name> where the font names are: default, script, script+bold, gothic, gothic+bold, serif+bold+italic, serif+bold, serif+italic, monospace, sansserif, sansserif+bold+italic, sansserif+bold, sansserif+italic, doublestrike
Check out the documentation for more examples!
Images
Create an image from the passed image and append that to the buffer

This takes myImage.jpg, converts the colors to ansi backgrounds and then stipples the details at a threshold of 40 (of 255) using a higher resolution image and then renders that into a braille overlay in black(#000000) on top of the colors.

 JS 
    art.image({
        src: "myImage.jpg",
        rows:80,
        cols:80,
        stipple:"#000000",
        posterize: true,
        threshold:40
    }, cb)

 CL 
    ascii-art image posterized stippled
        --rows=80 --cols=80 --stipple="#000000"
        --threshold=40 myImage.jpg

 Web 
    <ascii-art-image
        src="myImage.jpg"
        rows="80" cols="80"
        stipple="#000000"
        posterize
        threshold="40"
    ></ascii-art-image>

There are some options that are available which are not in the image core, they are:


lineart : A boolean option which outputs lineart using block characters (which may be colored with stroke and customized with threshold(0-255)).  Example 


stipple : A boolean option which outputs lineart using braille characters (which may be colored with stroke and customized with threshold(0-255)).  Example 


posterize : Use stipple on top of colored backgrounds to retain as much detail as possible.  Example 


blended : Use posterize with both lineart and braille at relative thresholds to each other. Example 



Downsampling and detail loss
Because of the resolution downsampling from the original dimensions to the destination width, some finer details may be lost. Plan accordingly. Here's an example of some sequential art in 256 color (primarily greyscale):
 Example 

 JS 
var art = require('ascii-art');
var Color = require('ascii-art-ansi/colors');
Color.is256 = true;
art.image({
    src: "node_modules/ascii-art/Images/grendel.jpg",
    alphabet:"blocks"
}, cb);

 CL 
    ascii-art image
        -B 8
        -C rankedChannel
        -a blocks
        node_modules/ascii-art/Images/grendel.jpg

 Web 
    <!-- todo -->

 

Color Modes
Multiple output modes are available including 4bit, 8bit, 32bit (equivalent to 24bit). 16bit color was intentionally excluded, as there is no direct terminal support and the cost of including color definitions for such a large set would not be justified. It would be feasible to implement as an optional import, should the need exist.
The following example takes zero-cool.jpg, converts the colors to ansi foreground color in solid block characters. Note that you will need to tune your distance function in 8bit mode, as what looks good varies by the type of imagery that goes through it.
Anecdotally, the default distance function only covers ~1/3 of the samples we've done, but we support many methods(euclideanDistance, classic, ratioDistance, classicByValue, CIE76Difference, closestByIntensity, rankedChannel, simple, minDeviation, luminosity, saturation, hue, original). But helpfully, you can merge algorithms by asking for algorithm1+algorithm2 (it uses equal weighting), or make your own.

Artwork[Non-Functional]
Fetch a graphic from a remote source and append it to the current buffer, which is not enabled by default. You must add a request compatible library by either setting the ENV variable ASCII_ART_REQUEST_MODULE or by setting it manually with art.setRequest(requestModule)

Fetch artwork from the requested source using the preconfigured request library.

 JS 
    art.artwork({}, cb) //returns String

 CL 
    # N/A

 Web 
    <!--N/A -->

Often I use this in conjunction with an image backdrop, for example to superimpose bones on the earth:

Compositing
We also support combining all these nifty elements you've made into a single composition, via a few functions available on the chains (.lines(), .overlay(), .border(), .strip() and .join()). Maybe I've got A BBS wall I want to have some dynamic info on.. I could make that with this

Check out the documentation for detailed examples!
Compatibility
If you're a chalk user, just use var chalk = require('ascii-art/kaolin'); in place of your existing chalk references (Much of color.js, too... since chalk is a subset of colors.js). No migration needed, keep using the wacky syntax you are used to(In this mode, refer to their docs, not mine).
Users of ascii-table will also note that interface is supported via require('ascii-art').Table, though our solution is ansi-aware, lazy rendering and better at sizing columns.
I may support the other colors stuff (extras & themes) eventually, but it's currently a low priority.
Roadmap
Goals

Re-enable .artwork()
Bring karma current, deprecate phantomjs
artwork source standard
Better Docs
value reversal (light vs dark)
HTML output
piping support on the command line
ATASCII art support
ANSI art support
PETSCII art support
2 colors per char with multisampling
Graph enhancements
REPL

Non Goals

realtime: videos, curses, etc.:
logging integration

Testing
In the root directory run:
npm run test

which runs the test suite directly. In order to test it in Chrome try:
npm run browser-test

In order to run the chalk test, use:
npm run chalk-test

Deprecations

.artwork() is currently non-functional while we enable an open-plugin standard, which will arrive shortly. When it does, you'll be able to plug any number of fetch solutions in, which hopefully matches whatever you currently bundle.
.toPromise() is now deprecated in favor of .completed() and will be removed when 3.x arrives
up to this point all files are UMD wrapped and may be used without modification in node(even old versions), the browser and via browser build systems. when 3.x arrives, the UMD versions may be part of an independent build process, while the mainline browser and node versions may continue to be uniform. If you have opinions on this, I'd like to hear them.

Development
How to dev : the simple version

fork ascii-art
git clone git@github.com:<YOUR GITHUB USERNAME>/ascii-art.git
go into the checked out module cd ascii-art
execute ./test/dev_setup.sh (this will install a number of dependencies in the parent directory)

How to dev : a better version

Fork all the ascii-art-modules(ascii-art-image, ascii-art-ansi, ascii-art-braille, ascii-art-docs, ascii-art-font, ascii-art-utf, ascii-art-graph, ascii-art-table), along with the root module.
git clone git@github.com:<YOUR GITHUB USERNAME>/ascii-art.git
go into the checked out module cd ascii-art
./dev_setup.sh <YOUR GITHUB USERNAME>
commit to your own branches master, then submit PRs from that to the master branch of the main repo.

After setup, run npm test to make sure everything is working correctly.
Note various modern editions of npm nuke links each time package-lock.json is written (which, depending on your settings, may be every new dependency you add). This can be remedied by executing npx module-auto-link -c 'npm-auto-link' in the module in question, which will restore it's links.
Please make sure to run the tests before submitting a patch and report any rough edges. Thanks!
Enjoy,

ascii-art.js




Images, fonts, tables, ansi styles and compositing in Node.js & the browser. 100% JS.  (What is ASCII-Art?)
In the beginning there was colors.js but in the fine tradition of vendors calling out a problem they have the solution to, chalk was introduced. In that same vein, I offer ascii-art as an update, expansion and generalization of MooAsciiArt and at the same time it can replace your existing ansi colors library.
It features support for Images, Styles, Tables, Graphs and Figlet Fonts as well as handling multi-line joining and compositing automatically.
Why would I use this?
 [click to expand/close] 

modular - small set of purpose built modules all interacting through a common ansi library.
color profiles support - other libraries mostly assume you are running x11.
no prototype manipulation - No String.prototype usage. No __proto__ usage. No BS.
handles the ugly intersection of multiline text and ansi codes for you.
runs in the browser and Node.js (CommonJS, AMD, globals, webpack, or webcomponents)
Other libraries out there do too little, focus on logging and have inconsistent ANSI handling *.
JS + Canvas No binaries... we are 100% JS, with a common code path in browser and server †.
It works like a package manager for figlet fonts.
flexible output Supports 4bit, 8bit and 32bit output
Supports your existing API We allow you to use the colors.js/chalk API or our own ‡.
* - Example: Style text, then put it in a table. It displays based on it's ansi string width, but balances cell widths based on the string width, leading to crazy looking output.

† - This allows us plug into averaging, distance and other logic dynamically, in powerful ways (In node this renders in cairo, via a Canvas shim)

‡ - while both have fluent apis we use a grid and are asynchronous, which enables large image processing and complex compositing scenarios, whereas the chalk API focuses on immediate string mutations




Installation

ascii-art supports many usage styles, but the different use cases require slightly different installations. If you have any questions, please ask.

 In Code 
    npm install --save ascii-art

 CLI 
    npm install -g ascii-art
or (Beta):
    npm install -g ascii-art-cl

 Web 
    npm install --save ascii-art-webcomponents

Call Style

All chains in ascii-art can be called in one of 3 ways. In this example we change "Some Text" to be formatted using the doom.flf font.

 Callback 
    art.font("Some Text", 'doom', (err, rendered)=>{
        //if err, err is the error that occured
        //if !err rendered is the ascii
    });

 Promise 
    art.font("Some Text", 'doom')
       .then((rendered)=>{
           //rendered is the ascii
       })).catch((err)=>{
           //err is an error
       }));

 Await 
    try{
        let rendered = await art.font("Some Text", 'doom').completed()
        //rendered is the ascii
    }catch(err){
        //err is an error
    }

Styles
Add ANSI styles to a string and return the result.

Change "Some Text" to be formatted with ansi codes for green (then have the colors reset at the end of the string)

 JS 
    art.style("Some Text", 'green', true) //returns String

 CL 
    ascii-art text -s green "Some Text"

 Web 
    <ascii-art-style
		style="green"
	>Some Text</ascii-art-style>

Styles are: italic, bold, underline, |framed|, |encircled|, overline, blink and  inverse . And available colors are:
Colors
Color defaults to 8 bit (most compatible), to enable other modes set booleans in the options:

is256 : compute the color using 256colors, as defined by ansi256. Note that full color output may need to tune the difference method to obtain optimal results.
isTrueColor : do not constrain color and directly output RGB to the console.

Color Tables may be found in the style documentation
Fonts
Render a string using a figlet font and add that to the buffer. There is a batch version of this function which does not chain and takes an array( .strings()).

Change "Some Text" to be formatted using the doom.flf font, which it will load from the predefined location (defaults to /Fonts)

 JS 
    art.font("Some Text", 'doom', true) //returns String

 CL 
    ascii-art font -F doom "Some Text"

 Web 
    <ascii-art-font
		font="doom"
	>Some Text</ascii-art-font>

Outputs
______                          _
|  _  \                        | |
| | | |  ___  _ __ ___    ___  | |
| | | | / _ \| '_ ` _ \  / _ \ | |
| |/ / |  __/| | | | | || (_) ||_|
|___/   \___||_| |_| |_| \___/ (_)

UTF Fonts
If you use UTF fonts(Which are part of your system fonts) your output looks more like:
 or  by using u:<utf font name> where the font names are: default, script, script+bold, gothic, gothic+bold, serif+bold+italic, serif+bold, serif+italic, monospace, sansserif, sansserif+bold+italic, sansserif+bold, sansserif+italic, doublestrike
Check out the documentation for more examples!
Images
Create an image from the passed image and append that to the buffer

This takes myImage.jpg, converts the colors to ansi backgrounds and then stipples the details at a threshold of 40 (of 255) using a higher resolution image and then renders that into a braille overlay in black(#000000) on top of the colors.

 JS 
    art.image({
        src: "myImage.jpg",
        rows:80,
        cols:80,
        stipple:"#000000",
        posterize: true,
        threshold:40
    }, cb)

 CL 
    ascii-art image posterized stippled
        --rows=80 --cols=80 --stipple="#000000"
        --threshold=40 myImage.jpg

 Web 
    <ascii-art-image
        src="myImage.jpg"
        rows="80" cols="80"
        stipple="#000000"
        posterize
        threshold="40"
    ></ascii-art-image>

There are some options that are available which are not in the image core, they are:


lineart : A boolean option which outputs lineart using block characters (which may be colored with stroke and customized with threshold(0-255)).  Example 


stipple : A boolean option which outputs lineart using braille characters (which may be colored with stroke and customized with threshold(0-255)).  Example 


posterize : Use stipple on top of colored backgrounds to retain as much detail as possible.  Example 


blended : Use posterize with both lineart and braille at relative thresholds to each other. Example 



Downsampling and detail loss
Because of the resolution downsampling from the original dimensions to the destination width, some finer details may be lost. Plan accordingly. Here's an example of some sequential art in 256 color (primarily greyscale):
 Example

Color Modes
Multiple output modes are available including 4bit, 8bit, 32bit (equivalent to 24bit). 16bit color was intentionally excluded, as there is no direct terminal support and the cost of including color definitions for such a large set would not be justified. It would be feasible to implement as an optional import, should the need exist.
The following example takes zero-cool.jpg, converts the colors to ansi foreground color in solid block characters. Note that you will need to tune your distance function in 8bit mode, as what looks good varies by the type of imagery that goes through it.
Anecdotally, the default distance function only covers ~1/3 of the samples we've done, but we support many methods(euclideanDistance, classic, ratioDistance, classicByValue, CIE76Difference, closestByIntensity, rankedChannel, simple, minDeviation, luminosity, saturation, hue, original). But helpfully, you can merge algorithms by asking for algorithm1+algorithm2 (it uses equal weighting), or make your own.

Tables
Generate a table from the passed data, with support for many styles and append that to the buffer

Render a table for with the provided data given the provided options

 JS 
    art.table({}, cb) //returns String

Artwork[Non-Functional]
Fetch a graphic from a remote source and append it to the current buffer, which is not enabled by default. You must add a request compatible library by either setting the ENV variable ASCII_ART_REQUEST_MODULE or by setting it manually with art.setRequest(requestModule)

Fetch artwork from the requested source using the preconfigured request library.

 JS 
    art.artwork({}, cb) //returns String

 CL 
    # N/A

 Web 
    <!--N/A -->

Often I use this in conjunction with an image backdrop, for example to superimpose bones on the earth:

Compositing
We also support combining all these nifty elements you've made into a single composition, via a few functions available on the chains (.lines(), .overlay(), .border(), .strip() and .join()). Maybe I've got A BBS wall I want to have some dynamic info on.. I could make that with this

Check out the documentation for detailed examples!
Compatibility
If you're a chalk user, just use var chalk = require('ascii-art/kaolin'); in place of your existing chalk references (Much of color.js, too... since chalk is a subset of colors.js). No migration needed, keep using the wacky syntax you are used to(In this mode, refer to their docs, not mine).
Users of ascii-table will also note that interface is supported via require('ascii-art').Table, though our solution is ansi-aware, lazy rendering and better at sizing columns.
I may support the other colors stuff (extras & themes) eventually, but it's currently a low priority.
Roadmap
Goals

Re-enable .artwork()
Bring karma current, deprecate phantomjs
artwork source standard
Better Docs
value reversal (light vs dark)
HTML output
piping support on the command line
ATASCII art support
ANSI art support
PETSCII art support
2 colors per char with multisampling
Graph enhancements
REPL

Non Goals

realtime: videos, curses, etc.:
logging integration

Testing
In the root directory run:
npm run test

which runs the test suite directly. In order to test it in Chrome try:
npm run browser-test

In order to run the chalk test, use:
npm run chalk-test

Deprecations

.artwork() is currently non-functional while we enable an open-plugin standard, which will arrive shortly. When it does, you'll be able to plug any number of fetch solutions in, which hopefully matches whatever you currently bundle.
.toPromise() is now deprecated in favor of .completed() and will be removed when 3.x arrives
up to this point all files are UMD wrapped and may be used without modification in node(even old versions), the browser and via browser build systems. when 3.x arrives, the UMD versions may be part of an independent build process, while the mainline browser and node versions may continue to be uniform. If you have opinions on this, I'd like to hear them.

Development
How to dev : the simple version

fork ascii-art
git clone git@github.com:<YOUR GITHUB USERNAME>/ascii-art.git
go into the checked out module cd ascii-art
execute ./test/dev_setup.sh (this will install a number of dependencies in the parent directory)

How to dev : a better version

Fork all the ascii-art-modules(ascii-art-image, ascii-art-ansi, ascii-art-braille, ascii-art-docs, ascii-art-font, ascii-art-utf, ascii-art-graph, ascii-art-table), along with the root module.
git clone git@github.com:<YOUR GITHUB USERNAME>/ascii-art.git
go into the checked out module cd ascii-art
./dev_setup.sh <YOUR GITHUB USERNAME>
commit to your own branches master, then submit PRs from that to the master branch of the main repo.

After setup, run npm test to make sure everything is working correctly.
Note various modern editions of npm nuke links each time package-lock.json is written (which, depending on your settings, may be every new dependency you add). This can be remedied by executing npx module-auto-link -c 'npm-auto-link' in the module in question, which will restore it's links.
Please make sure to run the tests before submitting a patch and report any rough edges. Thanks!
Enjoy,

      Automate your workflow from idea to production
      GitHub Actions makes it easy to automate all your software workflows, now with world-class CI/CD. Build, test, and deploy your code right from GitHub.
    
    
      Learn more about getting started with Actions.
    
  

  

  
    
      
      Linux, macOS, Windows, ARM, and containers
      Hosted runners for every major OS make it easy to build and test all your projects. Run directly on a VM or inside a container. Use your own VMs, in the cloud or on-prem, with self-hosted runners.
    

    
      
      Matrix builds
      Save time with matrix workflows that simultaneously test across multiple operating systems and versions of your runtime.
    

    
      
      Any language
      GitHub Actions supports Node.js, Python, Java, Ruby, PHP, Go, Rust, .NET, and more. Build, test, and deploy applications in your language of choice.
    

    
      
      Live logs
      See your workflow run in realtime with color and emoji. It’s one click to copy a link that highlights a specific line number to share a CI/CD failure.
    

    
      
      Built-in secret store
      Automate your software development practices with workflow files embracing the Git flow by codifying it in your repository.
    

    
      
      Multi-container testing
      Test your web service and its DB in your workflow by simply adding some docker-compose to your workflow file.\n\n\n\nkhrome

ascii-art.js




Images, fonts, tables, ansi styles and compositing in Node.js & the browser. 100% JS.  (What is ASCII-Art?)
In the beginning there was colors.js but in the fine tradition of vendors calling out a problem they have the solution to, chalk was introduced. In that same vein, I offer ascii-art as an update, expansion and generalization of MooAsciiArt and at the same time it can replace your existing ansi colors library.
It features support for Images, Styles, Tables, Graphs and Figlet Fonts as well as handling multi-line joining and compositing automatically.
Why would I use this?
 [click to expand/close] 

modular - small set of purpose built modules all interacting through a common ansi library.
color profiles support - other libraries mostly assume you are running x11.
no prototype manipulation - No String.prototype usage. No __proto__ usage. No BS.
handles the ugly intersection of multiline text and ansi codes for you.
runs in the browser and Node.js (CommonJS, AMD, globals, webpack, or webcomponents)
Other libraries out there do too little, focus on logging and have inconsistent ANSI handling *.
JS + Canvas No binaries... we are 100% JS, with a common code path in browser and server †.
It works like a package manager for figlet fonts.
flexible output Supports 4bit, 8bit and 32bit output
Supports your existing API We allow you to use the colors.js/chalk API or our own ‡.
* - Example: Style text, then put it in a table. It displays based on it's ansi string width, but balances cell widths based on the string width, leading to crazy looking output.

† - This allows us plug into averaging, distance and other logic dynamically, in powerful ways (In node this renders in cairo, via a Canvas shim)

‡ - while both have fluent apis we use a grid and are asynchronous, which enables large image processing and complex compositing scenarios, whereas the chalk API focuses on immediate string mutations




Installation

ascii-art supports many usage styles, but the different use cases require slightly different installations. If you have any questions, please ask.

 In Code 
    npm install --save ascii-art

 CLI 
    npm install -g ascii-art
or (Beta):
    npm install -g ascii-art-cl

 Web 
    npm install --save ascii-art-webcomponents

Call Style

All chains in ascii-art can be called in one of 3 ways. In this example we change "Some Text" to be formatted using the doom.flf font.

 Callback 
    art.font("Some Text", 'doom', (err, rendered)=>{
        //if err, err is the error that occured
        //if !err rendered is the ascii
    });

 Promise 
    art.font("Some Text", 'doom')
       .then((rendered)=>{
           //rendered is the ascii
       })).catch((err)=>{
           //err is an error
       }));

 Await 
    try{
        let rendered = await art.font("Some Text", 'doom').completed()
        //rendered is the ascii
    }catch(err){
        //err is an error
    }

Styles
Add ANSI styles to a string and return the result.

Change "Some Text" to be formatted with ansi codes for green (then have the colors reset at the end of the string)

 JS 
    art.style("Some Text", 'green', true) //returns String

 CL 
    ascii-art text -s green "Some Text"

 Web 
    <ascii-art-style
		style="green"
	>Some Text</ascii-art-style>

Styles are: italic, bold, underline, |framed|, |encircled|, overline, blink and  inverse . And available colors are:
Colors
Color defaults to 8 bit (most compatible), to enable other modes set booleans in the options:

is256 : compute the color using 256colors, as defined by ansi256. Note that full color output may need to tune the difference method to obtain optimal results.
isTrueColor : do not constrain color and directly output RGB to the console.

Color Tables may be found in the style documentation
Fonts
Render a string using a figlet font and add that to the buffer. There is a batch version of this function which does not chain and takes an array( .strings()).

Change "Some Text" to be formatted using the doom.flf font, which it will load from the predefined location (defaults to /Fonts)

 JS 
    art.font("Some Text", 'doom', true) //returns String

 CL 
    ascii-art font -F doom "Some Text"

 Web 
    <ascii-art-font
		font="doom"
	>Some Text</ascii-art-font>

Outputs
______                          _
|  _  \                        | |
| | | |  ___  _ __ ___    ___  | |
| | | | / _ \| '_ ` _ \  / _ \ | |
| |/ / |  __/| | | | | || (_) ||_|
|___/   \___||_| |_| |_| \___/ (_)

UTF Fonts
If you use UTF fonts(Which are part of your system fonts) your output looks more like:
 or  by using u:<utf font name> where the font names are: default, script, script+bold, gothic, gothic+bold, serif+bold+italic, serif+bold, serif+italic, monospace, sansserif, sansserif+bold+italic, sansserif+bold, sansserif+italic, doublestrike
Check out the documentation for more examples!
Images
Create an image from the passed image and append that to the buffer

This takes myImage.jpg, converts the colors to ansi backgrounds and then stipples the details at a threshold of 40 (of 255) using a higher resolution image and then renders that into a braille overlay in black(#000000) on top of the colors.

 JS 
    art.image({
        src: "myImage.jpg",
        rows:80,
        cols:80,
        stipple:"#000000",
        posterize: true,
        threshold:40
    }, cb)

 CL 
    ascii-art image posterized stippled
        --rows=80 --cols=80 --stipple="#000000"
        --threshold=40 myImage.jpg

 Web 
    <ascii-art-image
        src="myImage.jpg"
        rows="80" cols="80"
        stipple="#000000"
        posterize
        threshold="40"
    ></ascii-art-image>

There are some options that are available which are not in the image core, they are:


lineart : A boolean option which outputs lineart using block characters (which may be colored with stroke and customized with threshold(0-255)).  Example 


stipple : A boolean option which outputs lineart using braille characters (which may be colored with stroke and customized with threshold(0-255)).  Example 


posterize : Use stipple on top of colored backgrounds to retain as much detail as possible.  Example 


blended : Use posterize with both lineart and braille at relative thresholds to each other. Example 



Downsampling and detail loss
Because of the resolution downsampling from the original dimensions to the destination width, some finer details may be lost. Plan accordingly. Here's an example of some sequential art in 256 color (primarily greyscale):
 Example 

 JS 
var art = require('ascii-art');
var Color = require('ascii-art-ansi/colors');
Color.is256 = true;
art.image({
    src: "node_modules/ascii-art/Images/grendel.jpg",
    alphabet:"blocks"
}, cb);

 CL 
    ascii-art image
        -B 8
        -C rankedChannel
        -a blocks
        node_modules/ascii-art/Images/grendel.jpg

Color Modes
Multiple output modes are available including 4bit, 8bit, 32bit (equivalent to 24bit). 16bit color was intentionally excluded, as there is no direct terminal support and the cost of including color definitions for such a large set would not be justified. It would be feasible to implement as an optional import, should the need exist.
The following example takes zero-cool.jpg, converts the colors to ansi foreground color in solid block characters. Note that you will need to tune your distance function in 8bit mode, as what looks good varies by the type of imagery that goes through it.
Anecdotally, the default distance function only covers ~1/3 of the samples we've done, but we support many methods(euclideanDistance, classic, ratioDistance, classicByValue, CIE76Difference, closestByIntensity, rankedChannel, simple, minDeviation, luminosity, saturation, hue, original). But helpfully, you can merge algorithms by asking for algorithm1+algorithm2 (it uses equal weighting), or make your own.

Artwork[Non-Functional]
Fetch a graphic from a remote source and append it to the current buffer, which is not enabled by default. You must add a request compatible library by either setting the ENV variable ASCII_ART_REQUEST_MODULE or by setting it manually with art.setRequest(requestModule)

Fetch artwork from the requested source using the preconfigured request library.

 JS 
    art.artwork({}, cb) //returns String

 CL 
    # N/A

 Web 
    <!--N/A -->

Often I use this in conjunction with an image backdrop, for example to superimpose bones on the earth:

Compositing
We also support combining all these nifty elements you've made into a single composition, via a few functions available on the chains (.lines(), .overlay(), .border(), .strip() and .join()). Maybe I've got A BBS wall I want to have some dynamic info on.. I could make that with this

Check out the documentation for detailed examples!
Compatibility
If you're a chalk user, just use var chalk = require('ascii-art/kaolin'); in place of your existing chalk references (Much of color.js, too... since chalk is a subset of colors.js). No migration needed, keep using the wacky syntax you are used to(In this mode, refer to their docs, not mine).
Users of ascii-table will also note that interface is supported via require('ascii-art').Table, though our solution is ansi-aware, lazy rendering and better at sizing columns.
I may support the other colors stuff (extras & themes) eventually, but it's currently a low priority.
Roadmap
Goals

Re-enable .artwork()
Bring karma current, deprecate phantomjs
artwork source standard
Better Docs
value reversal (light vs dark)
HTML output
piping support on the command line
ATASCII art support
ANSI art support
PETSCII art support
2 colors per char with multisampling
Graph enhancements
REPL

Non Goals

realtime: videos, curses, etc.:
logging integration

Testing
In the root directory run:
npm run test

which runs the test suite directly. In order to test it in Chrome try:
npm run browser-test

In order to run the chalk test, use:
npm run chalk-test

Deprecations

.artwork() is currently non-functional while we enable an open-plugin standard, which will arrive shortly. When it does, you'll be able to plug any number of fetch solutions in, which hopefully matches whatever you currently bundle.
.toPromise() is now deprecated in favor of .completed() and will be removed when 3.x arrives
up to this point all files are UMD wrapped and may be used without modification in node(even old versions), the browser and via browser build systems. when 3.x arrives, the UMD versions may be part of an independent build process, while the mainline browser and node versions may continue to be uniform. If you have opinions on this, I'd like to hear them.

Development
How to dev : the simple version

fork ascii-art
git clone git@github.com:<YOUR GITHUB USERNAME>/ascii-art.git
go into the checked out module cd ascii-art
execute ./test/dev_setup.sh (this will install a number of dependencies in the parent directory)

How to dev : a better version

Fork all the ascii-art-modules(ascii-art-image, ascii-art-ansi, ascii-art-braille, ascii-art-docs, ascii-art-font, ascii-art-utf, ascii-art-graph, ascii-art-table), along with the root module.
git clone git@github.com:<YOUR GITHUB USERNAME>/ascii-art.git
go into the checked out module cd ascii-art
./dev_setup.sh <YOUR GITHUB USERNAME>
commit to your own branches master, then submit PRs from that to the master branch of the main repo.

After setup, run npm test to make sure everything is working correctly.
Note various modern editions of npm nuke links each time package-lock.json is written (which, depending on your settings, may be every new dependency you add). This can be remedied by executing npx module-auto-link -c 'npm-auto-link' in the module in question, which will restore it's links.
Please make sure to run the tests before submitting a patch and report any rough edges. Thanks!
Enjoy,

ascii-art.js




Images, fonts, tables, ansi styles and compositing in Node.js & the browser. 100% JS.  (What is ASCII-Art?)
In the beginning there was colors.js but in the fine tradition of vendors calling out a problem they have the solution to, chalk was introduced. In that same vein, I offer ascii-art as an update, expansion and generalization of MooAsciiArt and at the same time it can replace your existing ansi colors library.
It features support for Images, Styles, Tables, Graphs and Figlet Fonts as well as handling multi-line joining and compositing automatically.
Why would I use this?
 [click to expand/close] 

modular - small set of purpose built modules all interacting through a common ansi library.
color profiles support - other libraries mostly assume you are running x11.
no prototype manipulation - No String.prototype usage. No __proto__ usage. No BS.
handles the ugly intersection of multiline text and ansi codes for you.
runs in the browser and Node.js (CommonJS, AMD, globals, webpack, or webcomponents)
Other libraries out there do too little, focus on logging and have inconsistent ANSI handling *.
JS + Canvas No binaries... we are 100% JS, with a common code path in browser and server †.
It works like a package manager for figlet fonts.
flexible output Supports 4bit, 8bit and 32bit output
Supports your existing API We allow you to use the colors.js/chalk API or our own ‡.
* - Example: Style text, then put it in a table. It displays based on it's ansi string width, but balances cell widths based on the string width, leading to crazy looking output.

† - This allows us plug into averaging, distance and other logic dynamically, in powerful ways (In node this renders in cairo, via a Canvas shim)

‡ - while both have fluent apis we use a grid and are asynchronous, which enables large image processing and complex compositing scenarios, whereas the chalk API focuses on immediate string mutations




Installation

ascii-art supports many usage styles, but the different use cases require slightly different installations. If you have any questions, please ask.

 In Code 
    npm install --save ascii-art

 CLI 
    npm install -g ascii-art
or (Beta):
    npm install -g ascii-art-cl

 Web 
    npm install --save ascii-art-webcomponents

Call Style

All chains in ascii-art can be called in one of 3 ways. In this example we change "Some Text" to be formatted using the doom.flf font.

 Callback 
    art.font("Some Text", 'doom', (err, rendered)=>{
        //if err, err is the error that occured
        //if !err rendered is the ascii
    });

 Promise 
    art.font("Some Text", 'doom')
       .then((rendered)=>{
           //rendered is the ascii
       })).catch((err)=>{
           //err is an error
       }));

 Await 
    try{
        let rendered = await art.font("Some Text", 'doom').completed()
        //rendered is the ascii
    }catch(err){
        //err is an error
    }

Styles
Add ANSI styles to a string and return the result.

Change "Some Text" to be formatted with ansi codes for green (then have the colors reset at the end of the string)

 JS 
    art.style("Some Text", 'green', true) //returns String

 CL 
    ascii-art text -s green "Some Text"

 Web 
    <ascii-art-style
		style="green"
	>Some Text</ascii-art-style>

Styles are: italic, bold, underline, |framed|, |encircled|, overline, blink and  inverse . And available colors are:
Colors
Color defaults to 8 bit (most compatible), to enable other modes set booleans in the options:

is256 : compute the color using 256colors, as defined by ansi256. Note that full color output may need to tune the difference method to obtain optimal results.
isTrueColor : do not constrain color and directly output RGB to the console.

Color Tables may be found in the style documentation
Fonts
Render a string using a figlet font and add that to the buffer. There is a batch version of this function which does not chain and takes an array( .strings()).

Change "Some Text" to be formatted using the doom.flf font, which it will load from the predefined location (defaults to /Fonts)

 JS 
    art.font("Some Text", 'doom', true) //returns String

 CL 
    ascii-art font -F doom "Some Text"

 Web 
    <ascii-art-font
		font="doom"
	>Some Text</ascii-art-font>

Outputs
______                          _
|  _  \                        | |
| | | |  ___  _ __ ___    ___  | |
| | | | / _ \| '_ ` _ \  / _ \ | |
| |/ / |  __/| | | | | || (_) ||_|
|___/   \___||_| |_| |_| \___/ (_)

UTF Fonts
If you use UTF fonts(Which are part of your system fonts) your output looks more like:
 or  by using u:<utf font name> where the font names are: default, script, script+bold, gothic, gothic+bold, serif+bold+italic, serif+bold, serif+italic, monospace, sansserif, sansserif+bold+italic, sansserif+bold, sansserif+italic, doublestrike
Check out the documentation for more examples!
Images
Create an image from the passed image and append that to the buffer

This takes myImage.jpg, converts the colors to ansi backgrounds and then stipples the details at a threshold of 40 (of 255) using a higher resolution image and then renders that into a braille overlay in black(#000000) on top of the colors.

 JS 
    art.image({
        src: "myImage.jpg",
        rows:80,
        cols:80,
        stipple:"#000000",
        posterize: true,
        threshold:40
    }, cb)

 CL 
    ascii-art image posterized stippled
        --rows=80 --cols=80 --stipple="#000000"
        --threshold=40 myImage.jpg

 Web 
    <ascii-art-image
        src="myImage.jpg"
        rows="80" cols="80"
        stipple="#000000"
        posterize
        threshold="40"
    ></ascii-art-image>

There are some options that are available which are not in the image core, they are:


lineart : A boolean option which outputs lineart using block characters (which may be colored with stroke and customized with threshold(0-255)).  Example 


stipple : A boolean option which outputs lineart using braille characters (which may be colored with stroke and customized with threshold(0-255)).  Example 


posterize : Use stipple on top of colored backgrounds to retain as much detail as possible.  Example 


blended : Use posterize with both lineart and braille at relative thresholds to each other. Example 



Downsampling and detail loss
Because of the resolution downsampling from the original dimensions to the destination width, some finer details may be lost. Plan accordingly. Here's an example of some sequential art in 256 color (primarily greyscale):
 Example 

 JS 
var art = require('ascii-art');
var Color = require('ascii-art-ansi/colors');
Color.is256 = true;
art.image({
    src: "node_modules/ascii-art/Images/grendel.jpg",
    alphabet:"blocks"
}, cb);

 CL 
    ascii-art image
        -B 8
        -C rankedChannel
        -a blocks
        node_modules/ascii-art/Images/grendel.jpg

 Web 
    <!-- todo -->

 

Color Modes
Multiple output modes are available including 4bit, 8bit, 32bit (equivalent to 24bit). 16bit color was intentionally excluded, as there is no direct terminal support and the cost of including color definitions for such a large set would not be justified. It would be feasible to implement as an optional import, should the need exist.
The following example takes zero-cool.jpg, converts the colors to ansi foreground color in solid block characters. Note that you will need to tune your distance function in 8bit mode, as what looks good varies by the type of imagery that goes through it.
Anecdotally, the default distance function only covers ~1/3 of the samples we've done, but we support many methods(euclideanDistance, classic, ratioDistance, classicByValue, CIE76Difference, closestByIntensity, rankedChannel, simple, minDeviation, luminosity, saturation, hue, original). But helpfully, you can merge algorithms by asking for algorithm1+algorithm2 (it uses equal weighting), or make your own.

ascii-art.js




Images, fonts, tables, ansi styles and compositing in Node.js & the browser. 100% JS.  (What is ASCII-Art?)
In the beginning there was colors.js but in the fine tradition of vendors calling out a problem they have the solution to, chalk was introduced. In that same vein, I offer ascii-art as an update, expansion and generalization of MooAsciiArt and at the same time it can replace your existing ansi colors library.
It features support for Images, Styles, Tables, Graphs and Figlet Fonts as well as handling multi-line joining and compositing automatically.
Why would I use this?
 [click to expand/close] 

modular - small set of purpose built modules all interacting through a common ansi library.
color profiles support - other libraries mostly assume you are running x11.
no prototype manipulation - No String.prototype usage. No __proto__ usage. No BS.
handles the ugly intersection of multiline text and ansi codes for you.
runs in the browser and Node.js (CommonJS, AMD, globals, webpack, or webcomponents)
Other libraries out there do too little, focus on logging and have inconsistent ANSI handling *.
JS + Canvas No binaries... we are 100% JS, with a common code path in browser and server †.
It works like a package manager for figlet fonts.
flexible output Supports 4bit, 8bit and 32bit output
Supports your existing API We allow you to use the colors.js/chalk API or our own ‡.
* - Example: Style text, then put it in a table. It displays based on it's ansi string width, but balances cell widths based on the string width, leading to crazy looking output.

† - This allows us plug into averaging, distance and other logic dynamically, in powerful ways (In node this renders in cairo, via a Canvas shim)

‡ - while both have fluent apis we use a grid and are asynchronous, which enables large image processing and complex compositing scenarios, whereas the chalk API focuses on immediate string mutations




Installation

ascii-art supports many usage styles, but the different use cases require slightly different installations. If you have any questions, please ask.

 In Code 
    npm install --save ascii-art

 CLI 
    npm install -g ascii-art
or (Beta):
    npm install -g ascii-art-cl

 Web 
    npm install --save ascii-art-webcomponents

Call Style

All chains in ascii-art can be called in one of 3 ways. In this example we change "Some Text" to be formatted using the doom.flf font.

 Callback 
    art.font("Some Text", 'doom', (err, rendered)=>{
        //if err, err is the error that occured
        //if !err rendered is the ascii
    });

 Promise 
    art.font("Some Text", 'doom')
       .then((rendered)=>{
           //rendered is the ascii
       })).catch((err)=>{
           //err is an error
       }));

 Await 
    try{
        let rendered = await art.font("Some Text", 'doom').completed()
        //rendered is the ascii
    }catch(err){
        //err is an error
    }

Styles
Add ANSI styles to a string and return the result.

Change "Some Text" to be formatted with ansi codes for green (then have the colors reset at the end of the string)

 JS 
    art.style("Some Text", 'green', true) //returns String

 CL 
    ascii-art text -s green "Some Text"

 Web 
    <ascii-art-style
		style="green"
	>Some Text</ascii-art-style>

Styles are: italic, bold, underline, |framed|, |encircled|, overline, blink and  inverse . And available colors are:
Colors
Color defaults to 8 bit (most compatible), to enable other modes set booleans in the options:

is256 : compute the color using 256colors, as defined by ansi256. Note that full color output may need to tune the difference method to obtain optimal results.
isTrueColor : do not constrain color and directly output RGB to the console.

Color Tables may be found in the style documentation
Fonts
Render a string using a figlet font and add that to the buffer. There is a batch version of this function which does not chain and takes an array( .strings()).

Change "Some Text" to be formatted using the doom.flf font, which it will load from the predefined location (defaults to /Fonts)

 JS 
    art.font("Some Text", 'doom', true) //returns String

 CL 
    ascii-art font -F doom "Some Text"

 Web 
    <ascii-art-font
		font="doom"
	>Some Text</ascii-art-font>

Outputs
______                          _
|  _  \                        | |
| | | |  ___  _ __ ___    ___  | |
| | | | / _ \| '_ ` _ \  / _ \ | |
| |/ / |  __/| | | | | || (_) ||_|
|___/   \___||_| |_| |_| \___/ (_)

UTF Fonts
If you use UTF fonts(Which are part of your system fonts) your output looks more like:
 or  by using u:<utf font name> where the font names are: default, script, script+bold, gothic, gothic+bold, serif+bold+italic, serif+bold, serif+italic, monospace, sansserif, sansserif+bold+italic, sansserif+bold, sansserif+italic, doublestrike
Check out the documentation for more examples!
Images
Create an image from the passed image and append that to the buffer

This takes myImage.jpg, converts the colors to ansi backgrounds and then stipples the details at a threshold of 40 (of 255) using a higher resolution image and then renders that into a braille overlay in black(#000000) on top of the colors.

 JS 
    art.image({
        src: "myImage.jpg",
        rows:80,
        cols:80,
        stipple:"#000000",
        posterize: true,
        threshold:40
    }, cb)

 CL 
    ascii-art image posterized stippled
        --rows=80 --cols=80 --stipple="#000000"
        --threshold=40 myImage.jpg

 Web 
    <ascii-art-image
        src="myImage.jpg"
        rows="80" cols="80"
        stipple="#000000"
        posterize
        threshold="40"
    ></ascii-art-image>

There are some options that are available which are not in the image core, they are:


lineart : A boolean option which outputs lineart using block characters (which may be colored with stroke and customized with threshold(0-255)).  Example 


stipple : A boolean option which outputs lineart using braille characters (which may be colored with stroke and customized with threshold(0-255)).  Example 


posterize : Use stipple on top of colored backgrounds to retain as much detail as possible.  Example 


blended : Use posterize with both lineart and braille at relative thresholds to each other. Example 



Downsampling and detail loss
Because of the resolution downsampling from the original dimensions to the destination width, some finer details may be lost. Plan accordingly. Here's an example of some sequential art in 256 color (primarily greyscale):
 Example 

 JS 
var art = require('ascii-art');
var Color = require('ascii-art-ansi/colors');
Color.is256 = true;
art.image({
    src: "node_modules/ascii-art/Images/grendel.jpg",
    alphabet:"blocks"
}, cb);

 CL 
    ascii-art image
        -B 8
        -C rankedChannel
        -a blocks
        node_modules/ascii-art/Images/grendel.jpg

 Web 
    <!-- todo -->

 

Color Modes
Multiple output modes are available including 4bit, 8bit, 32bit (equivalent to 24bit). 16bit color was intentionally excluded, as there is no direct terminal support and the cost of including color definitions for such a large set would not be justified. It would be feasible to implement as an optional import, should the need exist.
The following example takes zero-cool.jpg, converts the colors to ansi foreground color in solid block characters. Note that you will need to tune your distance function in 8bit mode, as what looks good varies by the type of imagery that goes through it.
Anecdotally, the default distance function only covers ~1/3 of the samples we've done, but we support many methods(euclideanDistance, classic, ratioDistance, classicByValue, CIE76Difference, closestByIntensity, rankedChannel, simple, minDeviation, luminosity, saturation, hue, original). But helpfully, you can merge algorithms by asking for algorithm1+algorithm2 (it uses equal weighting), or make your own.

Tables
Generate a table from the passed data, with support for many styles and append that to the buffer

Render a table for with the provided data given the provided options

 JS 
    art.table({}, cb) //returns String

 CL 
    # N/A

 JS 
    art.graph({}, cb) //returns String

 CL 
    # N/A

 Web

Check out the documentation for more examples!
Artwork[Non-Functional]
Fetch a graphic from a remote source and append it to the current buffer, which is not enabled by default. You must add a request compatible library by either setting the ENV variable ASCII_ART_REQUEST_MODULE or by setting it manually with art.setRequest(requestModule)

Fetch artwork from the requested source using the preconfigured request library.

 JS 
    art.artwork({}, cb) //returns String

 CL 
    # N/A

 Web 
    <!--N/A -->

Often I use this in conjunction with an image backdrop, for example to superimpose bones on the earth:

Compositing
We also support combining all these nifty elements you've made into a single composition, via a few functions available on the chains (.lines(), .overlay(), .border(), .strip() and .join()). Maybe I've got A BBS wall I want to have some dynamic info on.. I could make that with this

Check out the documentation for detailed examples!
Compatibility
If you're a chalk user, just use var chalk = require('ascii-art/kaolin'); in place of your existing chalk references (Much of color.js, too... since chalk is a subset of colors.js). No migration needed, keep using the wacky syntax you are used to(In this mode, refer to their docs, not mine).
Users of ascii-table will also note that interface is supported via require('ascii-art').Table, though our solution is ansi-aware, lazy rendering and better at sizing columns.
I may support the other colors stuff (extras & themes) eventually, but it's currently a low priority.
Roadmap
Goals

Re-enable .artwork()
Bring karma current, deprecate phantomjs
artwork source standard
Better Docs
value reversal (light vs dark)
HTML output
piping support on the command line
ATASCII art support
ANSI art support
PETSCII art support
2 colors per char with multisampling
Graph enhancements
REPL

Non Goals

realtime: videos, curses, etc.:
logging integration

Testing
In the root directory run:
npm run test

which runs the test suite directly. In order to test it in Chrome try:
npm run browser-test

In order to run the chalk test, use:
npm run chalk-test

Deprecations

.artwork() is currently non-functional while we enable an open-plugin standard, which will arrive shortly. When it does, you'll be able to plug any number of fetch solutions in, which hopefully matches whatever you currently bundle.
.toPromise() is now deprecated in favor of .completed() and will be removed when 3.x arrives
up to this point all files are UMD wrapped and may be used without modification in node(even old versions), the browser and via browser build systems. when 3.x arrives, the UMD versions may be part of an independent build process, while the mainline browser and node versions may continue to be uniform. If you have opinions on this, I'd like to hear them.

Development
How to dev : the simple version

fork ascii-art
git clone git@github.com:<YOUR GITHUB USERNAME>/ascii-art.git
go into the checked out module cd ascii-art
execute ./test/dev_setup.sh (this will install a number of dependencies in the parent directory)

How to dev : a better version

Fork all the ascii-art-modules(ascii-art-image, ascii-art-ansi, ascii-art-braille, ascii-art-docs, ascii-art-font, ascii-art-utf, ascii-art-graph, ascii-art-table), along with the root module.
git clone git@github.com:<YOUR GITHUB USERNAME>/ascii-art.git
go into the checked out module cd ascii-art
./dev_setup.sh <YOUR GITHUB USERNAME>
commit to your own branches master, then submit PRs from that to the master branch of the main repo.

After setup, run npm test to make sure everything is working correctly.
Note various modern editions of npm nuke links each time package-lock.json is written (which, depending on your settings, may be every new dependency you add). This can be remedied by executing npx module-auto-link -c 'npm-auto-link' in the module in question, which will restore it's links.
Please make sure to run the tests before submitting a patch and report any rough edges. Thanks!

ascii-art.js




Images, fonts, tables, ansi styles and compositing in Node.js & the browser. 100% JS.  (What is ASCII-Art?)
In the beginning there was colors.js but in the fine tradition of vendors calling out a problem they have the solution to, chalk was introduced. In that same vein, I offer ascii-art as an update, expansion and generalization of MooAsciiArt and at the same time it can replace your existing ansi colors library.
It features support for Images, Styles, Tables, Graphs and Figlet Fonts as well as handling multi-line joining and compositing automatically.
Why would I use this?
 [click to expand/close] 

modular - small set of purpose built modules all interacting through a common ansi library.
color profiles support - other libraries mostly assume you are running x11.
no prototype manipulation - No String.prototype usage. No __proto__ usage. No BS.
handles the ugly intersection of multiline text and ansi codes for you.
runs in the browser and Node.js (CommonJS, AMD, globals, webpack, or webcomponents)
Other libraries out there do too little, focus on logging and have inconsistent ANSI handling *.
JS + Canvas No binaries... we are 100% JS, with a common code path in browser and server †.
It works like a package manager for figlet fonts.
flexible output Supports 4bit, 8bit and 32bit output
Supports your existing API We allow you to use the colors.js/chalk API or our own ‡.
* - Example: Style text, then put it in a table. It displays based on it's ansi string width, but balances cell widths based on the string width, leading to crazy looking output.

† - This allows us plug into averaging, distance and other logic dynamically, in powerful ways (In node this renders in cairo, via a Canvas shim)

‡ - while both have fluent apis we use a grid and are asynchronous, which enables large image processing and complex compositing scenarios, whereas the chalk API focuses on immediate string mutations




Installation

ascii-art supports many usage styles, but the different use cases require slightly different installations. If you have any questions, please ask.

 In Code 
    npm install --save ascii-art

 CLI 
    npm install -g ascii-art
or (Beta):
    npm install -g ascii-art-cl

 Web 
    npm install --save ascii-art-webcomponents

Call Style

All chains in ascii-art can be called in one of 3 ways. In this example we change "Some Text" to be formatted using the doom.flf font.

 Callback 
    art.font("Some Text", 'doom', (err, rendered)=>{
        //if err, err is the error that occured
        //if !err rendered is the ascii
    });

 Promise 
    art.font("Some Text", 'doom')
       .then((rendered)=>{
           //rendered is the ascii
       })).catch((err)=>{
           //err is an error
       }));

 Await 
    try{
        let rendered = await art.font("Some Text", 'doom').completed()
        //rendered is the ascii
    }catch(err){
        //err is an error
    }

Styles
Add ANSI styles to a string and return the result.

Change "Some Text" to be formatted with ansi codes for green (then have the colors reset at the end of the string)

 JS 
    art.style("Some Text", 'green', true) //returns String

 CL 
    ascii-art text -s green "Some Text"

 Web 
    <ascii-art-style
		style="green"
	>Some Text</ascii-art-style>

Styles are: italic, bold, underline, |framed|, |encircled|, overline, blink and  inverse . And available colors are:
Colors
Color defaults to 8 bit (most compatible), to enable other modes set booleans in the options:

is256 : compute the color using 256colors, as defined by ansi256. Note that full color output may need to tune the difference method to obtain optimal results.
isTrueColor : do not constrain color and directly output RGB to the console.

Color Tables may be found in the style documentation
Fonts
Render a string using a figlet font and add that to the buffer. There is a batch version of this function which does not chain and takes an array( .strings()).

Change "Some Text" to be formatted using the doom.flf font, which it will load from the predefined location (defaults to /Fonts)

 JS 
    art.font("Some Text", 'doom', true) //returns String

 CL 
    ascii-art font -F doom "Some Text"

 Web 
    <ascii-art-font
		font="doom"
	>Some Text</ascii-art-font>

Outputs
______                          _
|  _  \                        | |
| | | |  ___  _ __ ___    ___  | |
| | | | / _ \| '_ ` _ \  / _ \ | |
| |/ / |  __/| | | | | || (_) ||_|
|___/   \___||_| |_| |_| \___/ (_)

UTF Fonts
If you use UTF fonts(Which are part of your system fonts) your output looks more like:
 or  by using u:<utf font name> where the font names are: default, script, script+bold, gothic, gothic+bold, serif+bold+italic, serif+bold, serif+italic, monospace, sansserif, sansserif+bold+italic, sansserif+bold, sansserif+italic, doublestrike
Check out the documentation for more examples!
Images
Create an image from the passed image and append that to the buffer

This takes myImage.jpg, converts the colors to ansi backgrounds and then stipples the details at a threshold of 40 (of 255) using a higher resolution image and then renders that into a braille overlay in black(#000000) on top of the colors.

 JS 
    art.image({
        src: "myImage.jpg",
        rows:80,
        cols:80,
        stipple:"#000000",
        posterize: true,
        threshold:40
    }, cb)

 CL 
    ascii-art image posterized stippled
        --rows=80 --cols=80 --stipple="#000000"
        --threshold=40 myImage.jpg

 Web 
    <ascii-art-image
        src="myImage.jpg"
        rows="80" cols="80"
        stipple="#000000"
        posterize
        threshold="40"
    ></ascii-art-image>

There are some options that are available which are not in the image core, they are:


lineart : A boolean option which outputs lineart using block characters (which may be colored with stroke and customized with threshold(0-255)).  Example 


stipple : A boolean option which outputs lineart using braille characters (which may be colored with stroke and customized with threshold(0-255)).  Example 


posterize : Use stipple on top of colored backgrounds to retain as much detail as possible.  Example 


blended : Use posterize with both lineart and braille at relative thresholds to each other. Example 



Downsampling and detail loss
Because of the resolution downsampling from the original dimensions to the destination width, some finer details may be lost. Plan accordingly. Here's an example of some sequential art in 256 color (primarily greyscale):
 Example 

 JS 
var art = require('ascii-art');
var Color = require('ascii-art-ansi/colors');
Color.is256 = true;
art.image({
    src: "node_modules/ascii-art/Images/grendel.jpg",
    alphabet:"blocks"
}, cb);

 CL 
    ascii-art image
        -B 8
        -C rankedChannel
        -a blocks
        node_modules/ascii-art/Images/grendel.jpg

 Web 
    <!-- todo -->

 

Color Modes
Multiple output modes are available including 4bit, 8bit, 32bit (equivalent to 24bit). 16bit color was intentionally excluded, as there is no direct terminal support and the cost of including color definitions for such a large set would not be justified. It would be feasible to implement as an optional import, should the need exist.
The following example takes zero-cool.jpg, converts the colors to ansi foreground color in solid block characters. Note that you will need to tune your distance function in 8bit mode, as what looks good varies by the type of imagery that goes through it.
Anecdotally, the default distance function only covers ~1/3 of the samples we've done, but we support many methods(euclideanDistance, classic, ratioDistance, classicByValue, CIE76Difference, closestByIntensity, rankedChannel, simple, minDeviation, luminosity, saturation, hue, original). But helpfully, you can merge algorithms by asking for algorithm1+algorithm2 (it uses equal weighting), or make your own.

Artwork[Non-Functional]
Fetch a graphic from a remote source and append it to the current buffer, which is not enabled by default. You must add a request compatible library by either setting the ENV variable ASCII_ART_REQUEST_MODULE or by setting it manually with art.setRequest(requestModule)

Fetch artwork from the requested source using the preconfigured request library.

 JS 
    art.artwork({}, cb) //returns String

 CL 
    # N/A

 Web 
    <!--N/A -->

Often I use this in conjunction with an image backdrop, for example to superimpose bones on the earth:

Compositing
We also support combining all these nifty elements you've made into a single composition, via a few functions available on the chains (.lines(), .overlay(), .border(), .strip() and .join()). Maybe I've got A BBS wall I want to have some dynamic info on.. I could make that with this

Check out the documentation for detailed examples!
Compatibility
If you're a chalk user, just use var chalk = require('ascii-art/kaolin'); in place of your existing chalk references (Much of color.js, too... since chalk is a subset of colors.js). No migration needed, keep using the wacky syntax you are used to(In this mode, refer to their docs, not mine).
Users of ascii-table will also note that interface is supported via require('ascii-art').Table, though our solution is ansi-aware, lazy rendering and better at sizing columns.
I may support the other colors stuff (extras & themes) eventually, but it's currently a low priority.
Roadmap
Goals

Re-enable .artwork()
Bring karma current, deprecate phantomjs
artwork source standard
Better Docs
value reversal (light vs dark)
HTML output
piping support on the command line
ATASCII art support
ANSI art support
PETSCII art support
2 colors per char with multisampling
Graph enhancements
REPL

Non Goals

realtime: videos, curses, etc.:
logging integration

Testing
In the root directory run:
npm run test

which runs the test suite directly. In order to test it in Chrome try:
npm run browser-test

In order to run the chalk test, use:
npm run chalk-test

Deprecations

.artwork() is currently non-functional while we enable an open-plugin standard, which will arrive shortly. When it does, you'll be able to plug any number of fetch solutions in, which hopefully matches whatever you currently bundle.
.toPromise() is now deprecated in favor of .completed() and will be removed when 3.x arrives
up to this point all files are UMD wrapped and may be used without modification in node(even old versions), the browser and via browser build systems. when 3.x arrives, the UMD versions may be part of an independent build process, while the mainline browser and node versions may continue to be uniform. If you have opinions on this, I'd like to hear them.

Development
How to dev : the simple version

fork ascii-art
git clone git@github.com:<YOUR GITHUB USERNAME>/ascii-art.git
go into the checked out module cd ascii-art
execute ./test/dev_setup.sh (this will install a number of dependencies in the parent directory)

How to dev : a better version

Fork all the ascii-art-modules(ascii-art-image, ascii-art-ansi, ascii-art-braille, ascii-art-docs, ascii-art-font, ascii-art-utf, ascii-art-graph, ascii-art-table), along with the root module.
git clone git@github.com:<YOUR GITHUB USERNAME>/ascii-art.git
go into the checked out module cd ascii-art
./dev_setup.sh <YOUR GITHUB USERNAME>
commit to your own branches master, then submit PRs from that to the master branch of the main repo.

After setup, run npm test to make sure everything is working correctly.
Note various modern editions of npm nuke links each time package-lock.json is written (which, depending on your settings, may be every new dependency you add). This can be remedied by executing npx module-auto-link -c 'npm-auto-link' in the module in question, which will restore it's links.
Please make sure to run the tests before submitting a patch and report any rough edges. Thanks!
Enjoy,

Usage
By popular demand, colors now ships with two types of usages!
The super nifty way
var colors = require('colors');

console.log('hello'.green); // outputs green text
console.log('i like cake and pies'.underline.red); // outputs red underlined text
console.log('inverse the color'.inverse); // inverses the color
console.log('OMG Rainbows!'.rainbow); // rainbow
console.log('Run the trap'.trap); // Drops the bass
or a slightly less nifty way which doesn't extend String.prototype
var colors = require('colors/safe');

console.log(colors.green('hello')); // outputs green text
console.log(colors.red.underline('i like cake and pies')); // outputs red underlined text
console.log(colors.inverse('inverse the color')); // inverses the color
console.log(colors.rainbow('OMG Rainbows!')); // rainbow
console.log(colors.trap('Run the trap')); // Drops the bass
I prefer the first way. Some people seem to be afraid of extending String.prototype and prefer the second way.
If you are writing good code you will never have an issue with the first approach. If you really don't want to touch String.prototype, the second usage will not touch String native object.
Enabling/Disabling Colors
The package will auto-detect whether your terminal can use colors and enable/disable accordingly. When colors are disabled, the color functions do nothing. You can override this with a command-line flag:
node myapp.js --no-color
node myapp.js --color=false

node myapp.js --color
node myapp.js --color=true
node myapp.js --color=always

FORCE_COLOR=1 node myapp.js
Or in code:
var colors = require('colors');
colors.enable();
colors.disable();
Console.log string substitution
var name = 'Marak';
console.log(colors.green('Hello %s'), name);
// outputs -> 'Hello Marak'
Custom themes
Using standard API
var colors = require('colors');

colors.setTheme({
  silly: 'rainbow',
  input: 'grey',
  verbose: 'cyan',
  prompt: 'grey',
  info: 'green',
  data: 'grey',
  help: 'cyan',
  warn: 'yellow',
  debug: 'blue',
  error: 'red'
});

// outputs red text
console.log("this is an error".error);

// outputs yellow text
console.log("this is a warning".warn);
Using string safe API
var colors = require('colors/safe');

// set single property
var error = colors.red;
error('this is red');

// set theme
colors.setTheme({
  silly: 'rainbow',
  input: 'grey',
  verbose: 'cyan',
  prompt: 'grey',
  info: 'green',
  data: 'grey',
  help: 'cyan',
  warn: 'yellow',
  debug: 'blue',
  error: 'red'
});

// outputs red text
console.log(colors.error("this is an error"));

// outputs yellow text
console.log(colors.warn("this is a warning"));
Combining Colors
var colors = require('colors');

colors.setTheme({
  custom: ['red', 'underline']

Usage
By popular demand, colors now ships with two types of usages!
The super nifty way
var colors = require('colors');

console.log('hello'.green); // outputs green text
console.log('i like cake and pies'.underline.red); // outputs red underlined text
console.log('inverse the color'.inverse); // inverses the color
console.log('OMG Rainbows!'.rainbow); // rainbow
console.log('Run the trap'.trap); // Drops the bass
or a slightly less nifty way which doesn't extend String.prototype
var colors = require('colors/safe');

console.log(colors.green('hello')); // outputs green text
console.log(colors.red.underline('i like cake and pies')); // outputs red underlined text
console.log(colors.inverse('inverse the color')); // inverses the color
console.log(colors.rainbow('OMG Rainbows!')); // rainbow
console.log(colors.trap('Run the trap')); // Drops the bass
I prefer the first way. Some people seem to be afraid of extending String.prototype and prefer the second way.
If you are writing good code you will never have an issue with the first approach. If you really don't want to touch String.prototype, the second usage will not touch String native object.
Enabling/Disabling Colors
The package will auto-detect whether your terminal can use colors and enable/disable accordingly. When colors are disabled, the color functions do nothing. You can override this with a command-line flag:
node myapp.js --no-color
node myapp.js --color=false

node myapp.js --color
node myapp.js --color=true
node myapp.js --color=always

FORCE_COLOR=1 node myapp.js
Or in code:
var colors = require('colors');
colors.enable();
colors.disable();
Console.log string substitution
var name = 'Marak';
console.log(colors.green('Hello %s'), name);
// outputs -> 'Hello Marak'
Custom themes
Using standard API
var colors = require('colors');

colors.setTheme({
  silly: 'rainbow',
  input: 'grey',
  verbose: 'cyan',
  prompt: 'grey',
  info: 'green',
  data: 'grey',
  help: 'cyan',
  warn: 'yellow',
  debug: 'blue',
  error: 'red'
});

// outputs red text
console.log("this is an error".error);

// outputs yellow text
console.log("this is a warning".warn);
Using string safe API
var colors = require('colors/safe');

// set single property
var error = colors.red;
error('this is red');

// set theme
colors.setTheme({
  silly: 'rainbow',
  input: 'grey',
  verbose: 'cyan',
  prompt: 'grey',
  info: 'green',
  data: 'grey',
  help: 'cyan',
  warn: 'yellow',
  debug: 'blue',
  error: 'red'
});

// outputs red text
console.log(colors.error("this is an error"));

// outputs yellow text
console.log(colors.warn("this is a warning"));
Combining Colors
var colors = require('colors');

colors.setTheme({
  custom: ['red', 'underline']
});

console.log('test'.custom);
Protip: There is a secret undocumented style in colors. If you find the style you can summon him.

          It looks like an issue with Colors.js is causing problems now that Chalk is used for cli coloring.  This caused an issue with my generator which has also caused other people to chime in about different generators being broken.
In the linked PR there is a fix that works, but it would be helpful if someone from such a large project would chime in there to help force it through.  Thanks!

          This has nothing to do with Chalk, but rather two different versions of colors.js used in different sub dependencies, which makes it break. A good example why you should not extend built-ins. This is also the exact reason I created Chalk; it does not interfere with anything. I would recommend you switch to Chalk and help other generator authors to do the same ;)

          I've said it a few times. cli-table needs to update from the really old version of colors.

          Have you submitted a PR to that project to fix it?  If not I will go knock it out and we can end this discussion.
On a side note, I have switched to chalk for my project.  Thanks for being nice and helpful @sindresorhus!

          @Marak the only problem here is colors.js, not cli-table using an outdated version. It shouldn't matter. Sub-dependencies should never interfere with each other...

          I shouldn't have let @ronkorving or @mmalecki perform any commits to the project. The original problem of adding Object.defineProperty snuck in a year ago and was never released until people started bothering me to do another release a month or so ago.
I reverted back to where everything was and stable. Use it or don't. I don't care. I'm tired of being bothered.

+
+[![npm](https://nodei.co/npm/gulp-load-plugins.svg?downloads=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/gulp-load-plugins/)
+
+> Loads in any gulp plugins and attaches them to the global scope, or an object of your choice.
+
+[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jackfranklin/gulp-load-plugins.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jackfranklin/gulp-load-plugins)
+
+
+## Install
+
+```sh
+$ npm install --save-dev gulp-load-plugins
+```
+
+
+## Usage
+
+Given a `package.json` file that has some dependencies within:
+
+```json
+{
+    "dependencies": {
+        "gulp-jshint": "*",
+        "gulp-concat": "*"
+    }
+}
+```
+
+Adding this into your `Gulpfile.js`:
+
+```js
+var gulp = require('gulp');
+var gulpLoadPlugins = require('gulp-load-plugins');
+var plugins = gulpLoadPlugins();
+```
+
+Or, even shorter:
+
+```js
+var plugins = require('gulp-load-plugins')();
+```
+
+Will result in the following happening (roughly, plugins are lazy loaded but in practice you won't notice any difference):
+
+```js
+plugins.jshint = require('gulp-jshint');
+plugins.concat = require('gulp-concat');
+```
+
+You can then use the plugins just like you would if you'd manually required them, but referring to them as `plugins.name()`, rather than just `name()`.
+
+This frees you up from having to manually require each gulp plugin.
+
+## Options
+
+You can pass in an object of options that are shown below: (the values for the keys are the defaults):
+
+```js
+gulpLoadPlugins({
+    pattern: ['gulp-*', 'gulp.*'], // the glob(s) to search for
+    config: 'package.json', // where to find the plugins, by default searched up from process.cwd()
+    scope: ['dependencies', 'devDependencies', 'peerDependencies'], // which keys in the config to look within
+    replaceString: /^gulp(-|\.)/, // what to remove from the name of the module when adding it to the context
+    camelize: true, // if true, transforms hyphenated plugins names to camel case
+    lazy: true, // whether the plugins should be lazy loaded on demand
+    rename: {} // a mapping of plugins to rename
+});
+```
+
+## Renaming
+
+From 0.8.0, you can pass in an object of mappings for renaming plugins. For example, imagine you want to load the `gulp-ruby-sass` plugin, but want to refer to it as just `sass`:
+
+```js
+gulpLoadPlugins({
+  rename: {
+    'gulp-ruby-sass': 'sass'
+  }
+});
+```
+
+## npm Scopes
+
+`gulp-load-plugins` comes with [npm scope](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scope) support. The major difference is that scoped plugins are accessible through an object on `plugins` that represents the scope. For example, if the plugin is `@myco/gulp-test-plugin` then you can access the plugin as shown in the following example:
+
+```js
+var plugins = require('gulp-load-plugins')();
+
+plugins.myco.testPlugin();
+```
+
+## Lazy Loading
+
+In 0.4.0 and prior, lazy loading used to only work with plugins that return a function. In newer versions though, lazy loading should work for any plugin. If you have a problem related to this please try disabling lazy loading and see if that fixes it. Feel free to open an issue on this repo too.
+
+
+## Credit
+
+Credit largely goes to @sindresorhus for his [load-grunt-plugins](https://github.com/sindresorhus/load-grunt-tasks) plugin. This plugin is almost identical, just tweaked slightly to work with Gulp and to expose the required plugins.
+
+
+## Changelog
+
+##### 1.0.0-rc.1
+- This is the first release candidate for what will become version 1 of gulp-load-plugins. Once a fix for [#70](https://github.com/jackfranklin/gulp-load-plugins/issues/70) is landed, I plan to release V1.
+- **Breaking Change** support for `NODE_PATH` is no longer supported. It was causing complexities and in [the PR that droppped support](https://github.com/jackfranklin/gulp-load-plugins/pull/75) no one shouted that they required `NODE_PATH` support.
+
+##### 0.10.0
+- throw a more informative error if a plugin is loaded that gulp-load-plugins can't find. [PR](https://github.com/jackfranklin/gulp-load-plugins/pull/68) - thanks @connor4312
+- allow `require` to look on the `NODE_PATH` if it can't find the module in the working directory. [PR](https://github.com/jackfranklin/gulp-load-plugins/pull/69) - thanks @chmanie
+
+##### 0.9.0
+- add support for npm-scoped plugins. [PR](https://github.com/jackfranklin/gulp-load-plugins/pull/63) - thanks @hbetts
+
+##### 0.8.1
+- fixed a bug where gulp-load-plugins would use the right `package.json` file but the wrong `node_modules` directory - thanks @callumacrae
+
+##### 0.8.0
+- add the ability to rename plugins that gulp-load-plugins loads in.
+
+##### 0.7.1
+- add `files` property to package.json so only required files are downloaded when installed - thanks @shinnn
+
+
+##### 0.7.0
+- support loading plugins with a dot in the name, such as `gulp.spritesmith` - thanks to @MRuy
+- upgrade multimatch to 1.0.0
+
+
+##### 0.6.0
+- Fix issues around plugin picking wrong package.json file - thanks @iliakan (see [issue](https://github.com/jackfranklin/gulp-load-plugins/issues/35)).
+
+##### 0.5.3
+- Show a nicer error if the plugin is unable to load any configuration and hence can't find any dependencies to load
+
+##### 0.5.2
+- Swap out globule for multimatch, thanks @sindresorhus.
+
+##### 0.5.1
+- Updated some internal dependencies which should see some small improvements - thanks @shinnn for this contribution.
+
+##### 0.5.0
+- improved lazy loading so it should work with plugins that don't just return a function. Thanks to @nfroidure for help with this.
+
+##### 0.4.0
+- plugins are lazy loaded for performance benefit. Thanks @julien-f for this.
+
+##### 0.3.0
+- turn the `camelize` option on by default
+
+##### 0.2.0
+- added `camelize` option, thanks @kombucha.
+- renamed to `gulp-load-plugins`.
+
+##### 0.1.1
+- add link to this repository into `package.json` (thanks @ben-eb).
+
+##### 0.1.0
+- move to `gulpLoadplugins` returning an object with the tasks define.
+
+##### 0.0.5
+- added `replaceString` option to configure exactly what gets replace when the plugin adds the module to the context
+
+##### 0.0.4
+- fixed keyword typo so plugin appears in search for gulp plugins
+
+##### 0.0.3
+- removed accidental console.log I'd left in
+
+##### 0.0.2
+- fixed accidentally missing a dependency out of package.json
+
+##### 0.0.1
+- initial release

+# findup-sync [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/cowboy/node-findup-sync.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/cowboy/node-findup-sync)
+
+Find the first file matching a given pattern in the current directory or the nearest ancestor directory.
+
+## Getting Started
+Install the module with: `npm install findup-sync`
+
+```js
+var findup = require('findup-sync');
+
+// Start looking in the CWD.
+var filepath1 = findup('{a,b}*.txt');
+
+// Start looking somewhere else, and ignore case (probably a good idea).
+var filepath2 = findup('{a,b}*.txt', {cwd: '/some/path', nocase: true});
+```
+
+## Usage
+
+```js
+findup(patternOrPatterns [, minimatchOptions])
+```
+
+### patternOrPatterns
+Type: `String` or `Array`
+Default: none
+
+One or more wildcard glob patterns. Or just filenames.
+
+### minimatchOptions
+Type: `Object`
+Default: `{}`
+
+Options to be passed to [minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch).
+
+Note that if you want to start in a different directory than the current working directory, specify a `cwd` property here.
+

+# Glob
+
+Match files using the patterns the shell uses, like stars and stuff.
+
+This is a glob implementation in JavaScript.  It uses the `minimatch`
+library to do its matching.
+
+![](oh-my-glob.gif)
+
+## Usage
+
+```javascript
+var glob = require("glob")
+
+// options is optional
+glob("**/*.js", options, function (er, files) {
+  // files is an array of filenames.
+  // If the `nonull` option is set, and nothing
+  // was found, then files is ["**/*.js"]
+  // er is an error object or null.
+})
+```
+
+## Glob Primer
+
+"Globs" are the patterns you type when you do stuff like `ls *.js` on
+the command line, or put `build/*` in a `.gitignore` file.
+
+Before parsing the path part patterns, braced sections are expanded
+into a set.  Braced sections start with `{` and end with `}`, with any
+number of comma-delimited sections within.  Braced sections may contain
+slash characters, so `a{/b/c,bcd}` would expand into `a/b/c` and `abcd`.
+
+The following characters have special magic meaning when used in a
+path portion:
+
+* `*` Matches 0 or more characters in a single path portion
+* `?` Matches 1 character
+* `[...]` Matches a range of characters, similar to a RegExp range.
+  If the first character of the range is `!` or `^` then it matches
+  any character not in the range.
+* `!(pattern|pattern|pattern)` Matches anything that does not match
+  any of the patterns provided.
+* `?(pattern|pattern|pattern)` Matches zero or one occurrence of the
+  patterns provided.
+* `+(pattern|pattern|pattern)` Matches one or more occurrences of the
+  patterns provided.
+* `*(a|b|c)` Matches zero or more occurrences of the patterns provided
+* `@(pattern|pat*|pat?erN)` Matches exactly one of the patterns
+  provided
+* `**` If a "globstar" is alone in a path portion, then it matches
+  zero or more directories and subdirectories searching for matches.
+  It does not crawl symlinked directories.
+
+### Dots
+
+If a file or directory path portion has a `.` as the first character,
+then it will not match any glob pattern unless that pattern's
+corresponding path part also has a `.` as its first character.
+
+For example, the pattern `a/.*/c` would match the file at `a/.b/c`.
+However the pattern `a/*/c` would not, because `*` does not start with
+a dot character.
+
+You can make glob treat dots as normal characters by setting
+`dot:true` in the options.
+
+### Basename Matching
+
+If you set `matchBase:true` in the options, and the pattern has no
+slashes in it, then it will seek for any file anywhere in the tree
+with a matching basename.  For example, `*.js` would match
+`test/simple/basic.js`.
+
+### Negation
+
+The intent for negation would be for a pattern starting with `!` to
+match everything that *doesn't* match the supplied pattern.  However,
+the implementation is weird, and for the time being, this should be
+avoided.  The behavior will change or be deprecated in version 5.
+
+### Empty Sets
+
+If no matching files are found, then an empty array is returned.  This
+differs from the shell, where the pattern itself is returned.  For
+example:
+
+    $ echo a*s*d*f
+    a*s*d*f
+
+To get the bash-style behavior, set the `nonull:true` in the options.
+
+### See Also:
+
+* `man sh`
+* `man bash` (Search for "Pattern Matching")
+* `man 3 fnmatch`
+* `man 5 gitignore`
+* [minimatch documentation](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch)
+
+## glob.hasMagic(pattern, [options])
+
+Returns `true` if there are any special characters in the pattern, and
+`false` otherwise.
+
+Note that the options affect the results.  If `noext:true` is set in
+the options object, then `+(a|b)` will not be considered a magic
+pattern.  If the pattern has a brace expansion, like `a/{b/c,x/y}`
+then that is considered magical, unless `nobrace:true` is set in the
+options.
+
+## glob(pattern, [options], cb)
+
+* `pattern` {String} Pattern to be matched
+* `options` {Object}
+* `cb` {Function}
+  * `err` {Error | null}
+  * `matches` {Array<String>} filenames found matching the pattern
+
+Perform an asynchronous glob search.
+
+## glob.sync(pattern, [options])
+
+* `pattern` {String} Pattern to be matched
+* `options` {Object}
+* return: {Array<String>} filenames found matching the pattern
+
+Perform a synchronous glob search.
+
+## Class: glob.Glob
+
+Create a Glob object by instantiating the `glob.Glob` class.
+
+```javascript
+var Glob = require("glob").Glob
+var mg = new Glob(pattern, options, cb)
+```
+
+It's an EventEmitter, and starts walking the filesystem to find matches
+immediately.
+
+### new glob.Glob(pattern, [options], [cb])
+
+* `pattern` {String} pattern to search for
+* `options` {Object}
+* `cb` {Function} Called when an error occurs, or matches are found
+  * `err` {Error | null}
+  * `matches` {Array<String>} filenames found matching the pattern
+
+Note that if the `sync` flag is set in the options, then matches will
+be immediately available on the `g.found` member.
+
+### Properties
+
+* `minimatch` The minimatch object that the glob uses.
+* `options` The options object passed in.
+* `aborted` Boolean which is set to true when calling `abort()`.  There
+  is no way at this time to continue a glob search after aborting, but
+  you can re-use the statCache to avoid having to duplicate syscalls.
+* `statCache` Collection of all the stat results the glob search
+  performed.
+* `cache` Convenience object.  Each field has the following possible
+  values:
+  * `false` - Path does not exist
+  * `true` - Path exists
+  * `'DIR'` - Path exists, and is not a directory
+  * `'FILE'` - Path exists, and is a directory
+  * `[file, entries, ...]` - Path exists, is a directory, and the
+    array value is the results of `fs.readdir`
+* `statCache` Cache of `fs.stat` results, to prevent statting the same
+  path multiple times.
+* `symlinks` A record of which paths are symbolic links, which is
+  relevant in resolving `**` patterns.
+
+### Events
+
+* `end` When the matching is finished, this is emitted with all the
+  matches found.  If the `nonull` option is set, and no match was found,
+  then the `matches` list contains the original pattern.  The matches
+  are sorted, unless the `nosort` flag is set.
+* `match` Every time a match is found, this is emitted with the matched.
+* `error` Emitted when an unexpected error is encountered, or whenever
+  any fs error occurs if `options.strict` is set.
+* `abort` When `abort()` is called, this event is raised.
+
+### Methods
+
+* `pause` Temporarily stop the search
+* `resume` Resume the search
+* `abort` Stop the search forever
+
+### Options
+
+All the options that can be passed to Minimatch can also be passed to
+Glob to change pattern matching behavior.  Also, some have been added,
+or have glob-specific ramifications.
+
+All options are false by default, unless otherwise noted.
+
+All options are added to the Glob object, as well.
+
+If you are running many `glob` operations, you can pass a Glob object
+as the `options` argument to a subsequent operation to shortcut some
+`stat` and `readdir` calls.  At the very least, you may pass in shared
+`symlinks`, `statCache`, and `cache` options, so that parallel glob
+operations will be sped up by sharing information about the
+filesystem.
+
+* `cwd` The current working directory in which to search.  Defaults
+  to `process.cwd()`.
+* `root` The place where patterns starting with `/` will be mounted
+  onto.  Defaults to `path.resolve(options.cwd, "/")` (`/` on Unix
+  systems, and `C:\` or some such on Windows.)
+* `dot` Include `.dot` files in normal matches and `globstar` matches.
+  Note that an explicit dot in a portion of the pattern will always
+  match dot files.
+* `nomount` By default, a pattern starting with a forward-slash will be
+  "mounted" onto the root setting, so that a valid filesystem path is
+  returned.  Set this flag to disable that behavior.
+* `mark` Add a `/` character to directory matches.  Note that this
+  requires additional stat calls.
+* `nosort` Don't sort the results.
+* `stat` Set to true to stat *all* results.  This reduces performance
+  somewhat, and is completely unnecessary, unless `readdir` is presumed
+  to be an untrustworthy indicator of file existence.
+* `silent` When an unusual error is encountered when attempting to
+  read a directory, a warning will be printed to stderr.  Set the
+  `silent` option to true to suppress these warnings.
+* `strict` When an unusual error is encountered when attempting to
+  read a directory, the process will just continue on in search of
+  other matches.  Set the `strict` option to raise an error in these
+  cases.
+* `cache` See `cache` property above.  Pass in a previously generated
+  cache object to save some fs calls.
+* `statCache` A cache of results of filesystem information, to prevent
+  unnecessary stat calls.  While it should not normally be necessary
+  to set this, you may pass the statCache from one glob() call to the
+  options object of another, if you know that the filesystem will not
+  change between calls.  (See "Race Conditions" below.)
+* `symlinks` A cache of known symbolic links.  You may pass in a
+  previously generated `symlinks` object to save `lstat` calls when
+  resolving `**` matches.
+* `sync` Perform a synchronous glob search.
+* `nounique` In some cases, brace-expanded patterns can result in the
+  same file showing up multiple times in the result set.  By default,
+  this implementation prevents duplicates in the result set.  Set this
+  flag to disable that behavior.
+* `nonull` Set to never return an empty set, instead returning a set
+  containing the pattern itself.  This is the default in glob(3).
+* `debug` Set to enable debug logging in minimatch and glob.
+* `nobrace` Do not expand `{a,b}` and `{1..3}` brace sets.
+* `noglobstar` Do not match `**` against multiple filenames.  (Ie,
+  treat it as a normal `*` instead.)
+* `noext` Do not match `+(a|b)` "extglob" patterns.
+* `nocase` Perform a case-insensitive match.  Note: on
+  case-insensitive filesystems, non-magic patterns will match by
+  default, since `stat` and `readdir` will not raise errors.
+* `matchBase` Perform a basename-only match if the pattern does not
+  contain any slash characters.  That is, `*.js` would be treated as
+  equivalent to `**/*.js`, matching all js files in all directories.
+* `nonegate` Suppress `negate` behavior.  (See below.)
+* `nocomment` Suppress `comment` behavior.  (See below.)
+* `nonull` Return the pattern when no matches are found.
+* `nodir` Do not match directories, only files.
+
+## Comparisons to other fnmatch/glob implementations
+
+While strict compliance with the existing standards is a worthwhile
+goal, some discrepancies exist between node-glob and other
+implementations, and are intentional.
+
+If the pattern starts with a `!` character, then it is negated.  Set the
+`nonegate` flag to suppress this behavior, and treat leading `!`
+characters normally.  This is perhaps relevant if you wish to start the
+pattern with a negative extglob pattern like `!(a|B)`.  Multiple `!`
+characters at the start of a pattern will negate the pattern multiple
+times.
+
+If a pattern starts with `#`, then it is treated as a comment, and
+will not match anything.  Use `\#` to match a literal `#` at the
+start of a line, or set the `nocomment` flag to suppress this behavior.
+
+The double-star character `**` is supported by default, unless the
+`noglobstar` flag is set.  This is supported in the manner of bsdglob
+and bash 4.3, where `**` only has special significance if it is the only
+thing in a path part.  That is, `a/**/b` will match `a/x/y/b`, but
+`a/**b` will not.
+
+Note that symlinked directories are not crawled as part of a `**`,
+though their contents may match against subsequent portions of the
+pattern.  This prevents infinite loops and duplicates and the like.
+
+If an escaped pattern has no matches, and the `nonull` flag is set,
+then glob returns the pattern as-provided, rather than
+interpreting the character escapes.  For example,
+`glob.match([], "\\*a\\?")` will return `"\\*a\\?"` rather than
+`"*a?"`.  This is akin to setting the `nullglob` option in bash, except
+that it does not resolve escaped pattern characters.
+
+If brace expansion is not disabled, then it is performed before any
+other interpretation of the glob pattern.  Thus, a pattern like
+`+(a|{b),c)}`, which would not be valid in bash or zsh, is expanded
+**first** into the set of `+(a|b)` and `+(a|c)`, and those patterns are
+checked for validity.  Since those two are valid, matching proceeds.
+
+## Windows
+
+**Please only use forward-slashes in glob expressions.**
+
+Though windows uses either `/` or `\` as its path separator, only `/`
+characters are used by this glob implementation.  You must use
+forward-slashes **only** in glob expressions.  Back-slashes will always
+be interpreted as escape characters, not path separators.
+
+Results from absolute patterns such as `/foo/*` are mounted onto the
+root setting using `path.join`.  On windows, this will by default result
+in `/foo/*` matching `C:\foo\bar.txt`.
+
+## Race Conditions
+
+Glob searching, by its very nature, is susceptible to race conditions,
+since it relies on directory walking and such.
+
+As a result, it is possible that a file that exists when glob looks for
+it may have been deleted or modified by the time it returns the result.
+
+As part of its internal implementation, this program caches all stat
+and readdir calls that it makes, in order to cut down on system
+overhead.  However, this also makes it even more susceptible to races,
+especially if the cache or statCache objects are reused between glob
+calls.
+
+Users are thus advised not to use a glob result as a guarantee of
+filesystem state in the face of rapid changes.  For the vast majority
+of operations, this is never a problem.
+

-# Postcss play
+# Postcss js.la
+postcss is not a postprocessor. The idea behind it is that CSS should be able to be written without a user having to learn some meta language and it's syntax (SASS, LESS). We should be future proofing.
+
+postcss is an ecosystem of plugins that transforms CSS.
+
+- Gulp: ``` npm install gulp-postcss ```
+- CLI: ``` npm install -g postcss-cli ```

-# gulp-load-plugins
-
-[![npm](https://nodei.co/npm/gulp-load-plugins.svg?downloads=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/gulp-load-plugins/)
-
-> Loads in any gulp plugins and attaches them to the global scope, or an object of your choice.
-
-[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jackfranklin/gulp-load-plugins.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jackfranklin/gulp-load-plugins)
-
-
-## Install
-
-```sh
-$ npm install --save-dev gulp-load-plugins
-```
-
-
-## Usage
-
-Given a `package.json` file that has some dependencies within:
-
-```json
-{
-    "dependencies": {
-        "gulp-jshint": "*",
-        "gulp-concat": "*"
-    }
-}
-```
-
-Adding this into your `Gulpfile.js`:
-
-```js
-var gulp = require('gulp');
-var gulpLoadPlugins = require('gulp-load-plugins');
-var plugins = gulpLoadPlugins();
-```
-
-Or, even shorter:
-
-```js
-var plugins = require('gulp-load-plugins')();
-```
-
-Will result in the following happening (roughly, plugins are lazy loaded but in practice you won't notice any difference):
-
-```js
-plugins.jshint = require('gulp-jshint');
-plugins.concat = require('gulp-concat');
-```
-
-You can then use the plugins just like you would if you'd manually required them, but referring to them as `plugins.name()`, rather than just `name()`.
-
-This frees you up from having to manually require each gulp plugin.
-
-## Options
-
-You can pass in an object of options that are shown below: (the values for the keys are the defaults):
-
-```js
-gulpLoadPlugins({
-    pattern: ['gulp-*', 'gulp.*'], // the glob(s) to search for
-    config: 'package.json', // where to find the plugins, by default searched up from process.cwd()
-    scope: ['dependencies', 'devDependencies', 'peerDependencies'], // which keys in the config to look within
-    replaceString: /^gulp(-|\.)/, // what to remove from the name of the module when adding it to the context
-    camelize: true, // if true, transforms hyphenated plugins names to camel case
-    lazy: true, // whether the plugins should be lazy loaded on demand
-    rename: {} // a mapping of plugins to rename
-});
-```
-
-## Renaming
-
-From 0.8.0, you can pass in an object of mappings for renaming plugins. For example, imagine you want to load the `gulp-ruby-sass` plugin, but want to refer to it as just `sass`:
-
-```js
-gulpLoadPlugins({
-  rename: {
-    'gulp-ruby-sass': 'sass'
-  }
-});
-```
-
-## npm Scopes
-
-`gulp-load-plugins` comes with [npm scope](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scope) support. The major difference is that scoped plugins are accessible through an object on `plugins` that represents the scope. For example, if the plugin is `@myco/gulp-test-plugin` then you can access the plugin as shown in the following example:
-
-```js
-var plugins = require('gulp-load-plugins')();
-
-plugins.myco.testPlugin();
-```
-
-## Lazy Loading
-
-In 0.4.0 and prior, lazy loading used to only work with plugins that return a function. In newer versions though, lazy loading should work for any plugin. If you have a problem related to this please try disabling lazy loading and see if that fixes it. Feel free to open an issue on this repo too.
-
-
-## Credit
-
-Credit largely goes to @sindresorhus for his [load-grunt-plugins](https://github.com/sindresorhus/load-grunt-tasks) plugin. This plugin is almost identical, just tweaked slightly to work with Gulp and to expose the required plugins.
-
-
-## Changelog
-
-##### 1.0.0-rc.1
-- This is the first release candidate for what will become version 1 of gulp-load-plugins. Once a fix for [#70](https://github.com/jackfranklin/gulp-load-plugins/issues/70) is landed, I plan to release V1.
-- **Breaking Change** support for `NODE_PATH` is no longer supported. It was causing complexities and in [the PR that droppped support](https://github.com/jackfranklin/gulp-load-plugins/pull/75) no one shouted that they required `NODE_PATH` support.
-
-##### 0.10.0
-- throw a more informative error if a plugin is loaded that gulp-load-plugins can't find. [PR](https://github.com/jackfranklin/gulp-load-plugins/pull/68) - thanks @connor4312
-- allow `require` to look on the `NODE_PATH` if it can't find the module in the working directory. [PR](https://github.com/jackfranklin/gulp-load-plugins/pull/69) - thanks @chmanie
-
-##### 0.9.0
-- add support for npm-scoped plugins. [PR](https://github.com/jackfranklin/gulp-load-plugins/pull/63) - thanks @hbetts
-
-##### 0.8.1
-- fixed a bug where gulp-load-plugins would use the right `package.json` file but the wrong `node_modules` directory - thanks @callumacrae
-
-##### 0.8.0
-- add the ability to rename plugins that gulp-load-plugins loads in.
-
-##### 0.7.1
-- add `files` property to package.json so only required files are downloaded when installed - thanks @shinnn
-
-
-##### 0.7.0
-- support loading plugins with a dot in the name, such as `gulp.spritesmith` - thanks to @MRuy
-- upgrade multimatch to 1.0.0
-
-
-##### 0.6.0
-- Fix issues around plugin picking wrong package.json file - thanks @iliakan (see [issue](https://github.com/jackfranklin/gulp-load-plugins/issues/35)).
-
-##### 0.5.3
-- Show a nicer error if the plugin is unable to load any configuration and hence can't find any dependencies to load
-
-##### 0.5.2
-- Swap out globule for multimatch, thanks @sindresorhus.
-
-##### 0.5.1
-- Updated some internal dependencies which should see some small improvements - thanks @shinnn for this contribution.
-
-##### 0.5.0
-- improved lazy loading so it should work with plugins that don't just return a function. Thanks to @nfroidure for help with this.
-
-##### 0.4.0
-- plugins are lazy loaded for performance benefit. Thanks @julien-f for this.
-
-##### 0.3.0
-- turn the `camelize` option on by default
-
-##### 0.2.0
-- added `camelize` option, thanks @kombucha.
-- renamed to `gulp-load-plugins`.
-
-##### 0.1.1
-- add link to this repository into `package.json` (thanks @ben-eb).
-
-##### 0.1.0
-- move to `gulpLoadplugins` returning an object with the tasks define.
-
-##### 0.0.5
-- added `replaceString` option to configure exactly what gets replace when the plugin adds the module to the context
-
-##### 0.0.4
-- fixed keyword typo so plugin appears in search for gulp plugins
-
-##### 0.0.3
-- removed accidental console.log I'd left in
-
-##### 0.0.2
-- fixed accidentally missing a dependency out of package.json
-
-##### 0.0.1
-- initial release

-
-Find the first file matching a given pattern in the current directory or the nearest ancestor directory.
-
-## Getting Started
-Install the module with: `npm install findup-sync`
-
-```js
-var findup = require('findup-sync');
-
-// Start looking in the CWD.
-var filepath1 = findup('{a,b}*.txt');
-
-// Start looking somewhere else, and ignore case (probably a good idea).
-var filepath2 = findup('{a,b}*.txt', {cwd: '/some/path', nocase: true});
-```
-
-## Usage
-
-```js
-findup(patternOrPatterns [, minimatchOptions])
-```
-
-### patternOrPatterns
-Type: `String` or `Array`
-Default: none
-
-One or more wildcard glob patterns. Or just filenames.
-
-### minimatchOptions
-Type: `Object`
-Default: `{}`
-
-Options to be passed to [minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch).
-
-Note that if you want to start in a different directory than the current working directory, specify a `cwd` property here.
-
-## Contributing
-In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).

-# Glob
-
-Match files using the patterns the shell uses, like stars and stuff.
-
-This is a glob implementation in JavaScript.  It uses the `minimatch`
-library to do its matching.
-
-![](oh-my-glob.gif)
-
-## Usage
-
-```javascript
-var glob = require("glob")
-
-// options is optional
-glob("**/*.js", options, function (er, files) {
-  // files is an array of filenames.
-  // If the `nonull` option is set, and nothing
-  // was found, then files is ["**/*.js"]
-  // er is an error object or null.
-})
-```
-
-## Glob Primer
-
-"Globs" are the patterns you type when you do stuff like `ls *.js` on
-the command line, or put `build/*` in a `.gitignore` file.
-
-Before parsing the path part patterns, braced sections are expanded
-into a set.  Braced sections start with `{` and end with `}`, with any
-number of comma-delimited sections within.  Braced sections may contain
-slash characters, so `a{/b/c,bcd}` would expand into `a/b/c` and `abcd`.
-
-The following characters have special magic meaning when used in a
-path portion:
-
-* `*` Matches 0 or more characters in a single path portion
-* `?` Matches 1 character
-* `[...]` Matches a range of characters, similar to a RegExp range.
-  If the first character of the range is `!` or `^` then it matches
-  any character not in the range.
-* `!(pattern|pattern|pattern)` Matches anything that does not match
-  any of the patterns provided.
-* `?(pattern|pattern|pattern)` Matches zero or one occurrence of the
-  patterns provided.
-* `+(pattern|pattern|pattern)` Matches one or more occurrences of the
-  patterns provided.
-* `*(a|b|c)` Matches zero or more occurrences of the patterns provided
-* `@(pattern|pat*|pat?erN)` Matches exactly one of the patterns
-  provided
-* `**` If a "globstar" is alone in a path portion, then it matches
-  zero or more directories and subdirectories searching for matches.
-  It does not crawl symlinked directories.
-
-### Dots
-
-If a file or directory path portion has a `.` as the first character,
-then it will not match any glob pattern unless that pattern's
-corresponding path part also has a `.` as its first character.
-
-For example, the pattern `a/.*/c` would match the file at `a/.b/c`.
-However the pattern `a/*/c` would not, because `*` does not start with
-a dot character.
-
-You can make glob treat dots as normal characters by setting
-`dot:true` in the options.
-
-### Basename Matching
-
-If you set `matchBase:true` in the options, and the pattern has no
-slashes in it, then it will seek for any file anywhere in the tree
-with a matching basename.  For example, `*.js` would match
-`test/simple/basic.js`.
-
-### Negation
-
-The intent for negation would be for a pattern starting with `!` to
-match everything that *doesn't* match the supplied pattern.  However,
-the implementation is weird, and for the time being, this should be
-avoided.  The behavior will change or be deprecated in version 5.
-
-### Empty Sets
-
-If no matching files are found, then an empty array is returned.  This
-differs from the shell, where the pattern itself is returned.  For
-example:
-
-    $ echo a*s*d*f
-    a*s*d*f
-
-To get the bash-style behavior, set the `nonull:true` in the options.
-
-### See Also:
-
-* `man sh`
-* `man bash` (Search for "Pattern Matching")
-* `man 3 fnmatch`
-* `man 5 gitignore`
-* [minimatch documentation](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch)
-
-## glob.hasMagic(pattern, [options])
-
-Returns `true` if there are any special characters in the pattern, and
-`false` otherwise.
-
-Note that the options affect the results.  If `noext:true` is set in
-the options object, then `+(a|b)` will not be considered a magic
-pattern.  If the pattern has a brace expansion, like `a/{b/c,x/y}`
-then that is considered magical, unless `nobrace:true` is set in the
-options.
-
-## glob(pattern, [options], cb)
-
-* `pattern` {String} Pattern to be matched
-* `options` {Object}
-* `cb` {Function}
-  * `err` {Error | null}
-  * `matches` {Array<String>} filenames found matching the pattern
-
-Perform an asynchronous glob search.
-
-## glob.sync(pattern, [options])
-
-* `pattern` {String} Pattern to be matched
-* `options` {Object}
-* return: {Array<String>} filenames found matching the pattern
-
-Perform a synchronous glob search.
-
-## Class: glob.Glob
-
-Create a Glob object by instantiating the `glob.Glob` class.
-
-```javascript
-var Glob = require("glob").Glob
-var mg = new Glob(pattern, options, cb)
-```
-
-It's an EventEmitter, and starts walking the filesystem to find matches
-immediately.
-
-### new glob.Glob(pattern, [options], [cb])
-
-* `pattern` {String} pattern to search for
-* `options` {Object}
-* `cb` {Function} Called when an error occurs, or matches are found
-  * `err` {Error | null}
-  * `matches` {Array<String>} filenames found matching the pattern
-
-Note that if the `sync` flag is set in the options, then matches will
-be immediately available on the `g.found` member.
-
-### Properties
-
-* `minimatch` The minimatch object that the glob uses.
-* `options` The options object passed in.
-* `aborted` Boolean which is set to true when calling `abort()`.  There
-  is no way at this time to continue a glob search after aborting, but
-  you can re-use the statCache to avoid having to duplicate syscalls.
-* `statCache` Collection of all the stat results the glob search
-  performed.
-* `cache` Convenience object.  Each field has the following possible
-  values:
-  * `false` - Path does not exist
-  * `true` - Path exists
-  * `'DIR'` - Path exists, and is not a directory
-  * `'FILE'` - Path exists, and is a directory
-  * `[file, entries, ...]` - Path exists, is a directory, and the
-    array value is the results of `fs.readdir`
-* `statCache` Cache of `fs.stat` results, to prevent statting the same
-  path multiple times.
-* `symlinks` A record of which paths are symbolic links, which is
-  relevant in resolving `**` patterns.
-
-### Events
-
-* `end` When the matching is finished, this is emitted with all the
-  matches found.  If the `nonull` option is set, and no match was found,
-  then the `matches` list contains the original pattern.  The matches
-  are sorted, unless the `nosort` flag is set.
-* `match` Every time a match is found, this is emitted with the matched.
-* `error` Emitted when an unexpected error is encountered, or whenever
-  any fs error occurs if `options.strict` is set.
-* `abort` When `abort()` is called, this event is raised.
-
-### Methods
-
-* `pause` Temporarily stop the search
-* `resume` Resume the search
-* `abort` Stop the search forever
-
-### Options
-
-All the options that can be passed to Minimatch can also be passed to
-Glob to change pattern matching behavior.  Also, some have been added,
-or have glob-specific ramifications.
-
-All options are false by default, unless otherwise noted.
-
-All options are added to the Glob object, as well.
-
-If you are running many `glob` operations, you can pass a Glob object
-as the `options` argument to a subsequent operation to shortcut some
-`stat` and `readdir` calls.  At the very least, you may pass in shared
-`symlinks`, `statCache`, and `cache` options, so that parallel glob
-operations will be sped up by sharing information about the
-filesystem.
-
-* `cwd` The current working directory in which to search.  Defaults
-  to `process.cwd()`.
-* `root` The place where patterns starting with `/` will be mounted
-  onto.  Defaults to `path.resolve(options.cwd, "/")` (`/` on Unix
-  systems, and `C:\` or some such on Windows.)
-* `dot` Include `.dot` files in normal matches and `globstar` matches.
-  Note that an explicit dot in a portion of the pattern will always
-  match dot files.
-* `nomount` By default, a pattern starting with a forward-slash will be
-  "mounted" onto the root setting, so that a valid filesystem path is
-  returned.  Set this flag to disable that behavior.
-* `mark` Add a `/` character to directory matches.  Note that this
-  requires additional stat calls.
-* `nosort` Don't sort the results.
-* `stat` Set to true to stat *all* results.  This reduces performance
-  somewhat, and is completely unnecessary, unless `readdir` is presumed
-  to be an untrustworthy indicator of file existence.
-* `silent` When an unusual error is encountered when attempting to
-  read a directory, a warning will be printed to stderr.  Set the
-  `silent` option to true to suppress these warnings.
-* `strict` When an unusual error is encountered when attempting to
-  read a directory, the process will just continue on in search of
-  other matches.  Set the `strict` option to raise an error in these
-  cases.
-* `cache` See `cache` property above.  Pass in a previously generated
-  cache object to save some fs calls.
-* `statCache` A cache of results of filesystem information, to prevent
-  unnecessary stat calls.  While it should not normally be necessary
-  to set this, you may pass the statCache from one glob() call to the
-  options object of another, if you know that the filesystem will not
-  change between calls.  (See "Race Conditions" below.)
-* `symlinks` A cache of known symbolic links.  You may pass in a
-  previously generated `symlinks` object to save `lstat` calls when
-  resolving `**` matches.
-* `sync` Perform a synchronous glob search.
-* `nounique` In some cases, brace-expanded patterns can result in the
-  same file showing up multiple times in the result set.  By default,
-  this implementation prevents duplicates in the result set.  Set this
-  flag to disable that behavior.
-* `nonull` Set to never return an empty set, instead returning a set
-  containing the pattern itself.  This is the default in glob(3).
-* `debug` Set to enable debug logging in minimatch and glob.
-* `nobrace` Do not expand `{a,b}` and `{1..3}` brace sets.
-* `noglobstar` Do not match `**` against multiple filenames.  (Ie,
-  treat it as a normal `*` instead.)
-* `noext` Do not match `+(a|b)` "extglob" patterns.
-* `nocase` Perform a case-insensitive match.  Note: on
-  case-insensitive filesystems, non-magic patterns will match by
-  default, since `stat` and `readdir` will not raise errors.
-* `matchBase` Perform a basename-only match if the pattern does not
-  contain any slash characters.  That is, `*.js` would be treated as
-  equivalent to `**/*.js`, matching all js files in all directories.
-* `nonegate` Suppress `negate` behavior.  (See below.)
-* `nocomment` Suppress `comment` behavior.  (See below.)
-* `nonull` Return the pattern when no matches are found.
-* `nodir` Do not match directories, only files.
-
-## Comparisons to other fnmatch/glob implementations
-
-While strict compliance with the existing standards is a worthwhile
-goal, some discrepancies exist between node-glob and other
-implementations, and are intentional.
-
-If the pattern starts with a `!` character, then it is negated.  Set the
-`nonegate` flag to suppress this behavior, and treat leading `!`
-characters normally.  This is perhaps relevant if you wish to start the
-pattern with a negative extglob pattern like `!(a|B)`.  Multiple `!`
-characters at the start of a pattern will negate the pattern multiple
-times.
-
-If a pattern starts with `#`, then it is treated as a comment, and
-will not match anything.  Use `\#` to match a literal `#` at the
-start of a line, or set the `nocomment` flag to suppress this behavior.
-
-The double-star character `**` is supported by default, unless the
-`noglobstar` flag is set.  This is supported in the manner of bsdglob
-and bash 4.3, where `**` only has special significance if it is the only
-thing in a path part.  That is, `a/**/b` will match `a/x/y/b`, but
-`a/**b` will not.
-
-Note that symlinked directories are not crawled as part of a `**`,
-though their contents may match against subsequent portions of the
-pattern.  This prevents infinite loops and duplicates and the like.
-
-If an escaped pattern has no matches, and the `nonull` flag is set,
-then glob returns the pattern as-provided, rather than
-interpreting the character escapes.  For example,
-`glob.match([], "\\*a\\?")` will return `"\\*a\\?"` rather than
-`"*a?"`.  This is akin to setting the `nullglob` option in bash, except
-that it does not resolve escaped pattern characters.
-
-If brace expansion is not disabled, then it is performed before any
-other interpretation of the glob pattern.  Thus, a pattern like
-`+(a|{b),c)}`, which would not be valid in bash or zsh, is expanded
-**first** into the set of `+(a|b)` and `+(a|c)`, and those patterns are
-checked for validity.  Since those two are valid, matching proceeds.
-
-## Windows
-
-**Please only use forward-slashes in glob expressions.**
-
-Though windows uses either `/` or `\` as its path separator, only `/`
-characters are used by this glob implementation.  You must use
-forward-slashes **only** in glob expressions.  Back-slashes will always
-be interpreted as escape characters, not path separators.
-
-Results from absolute patterns such as `/foo/*` are mounted onto the
-root setting using `path.join`.  On windows, this will by default result
-in `/foo/*` matching `C:\foo\bar.txt`.
-
-## Race Conditions
-
-Glob searching, by its very nature, is susceptible to race conditions,
-since it relies on directory walking and such.
-
-As a result, it is possible that a file that exists when glob looks for
-it may have been deleted or modified by the time it returns the result.
-
-As part of its internal implementation, this program caches all stat
-and readdir calls that it makes, in order to cut down on system
-overhead.  However, this also makes it even more susceptible to races,
-especially if the cache or statCache objects are reused between glob
-calls.
-
-Users are thus advised not to use a glob result as a guarantee of
-filesystem state in the face of rapid changes.  For the vast majority
-of operations, this is never a problem.
-
-## Contributing

-// Approach:
-//
-// 1. Get the minimatch set
-// 2. For each pattern in the set, PROCESS(pattern, false)
-// 3. Store matches per-set, then uniq them
-//
-// PROCESS(pattern, inGlobStar)
-// Get the first [n] items from pattern that are all strings
-// Join these together.  This is PREFIX.
-//   If there is no more remaining, then stat(PREFIX) and
-//   add to matches if it succeeds.  END.
-//
-// If inGlobStar and PREFIX is symlink and points to dir
-//   set ENTRIES = []
-// else readdir(PREFIX) as ENTRIES
-//   If fail, END
-//
-// with ENTRIES
-//   If pattern[n] is GLOBSTAR
-//     // handle the case where the globstar match is empty
-//     // by pruning it out, and testing the resulting pattern
-//     PROCESS(pattern[0..n] + pattern[n+1 .. $], false)
-//     // handle other cases.
-//     for ENTRY in ENTRIES (not dotfiles)
-//       // attach globstar + tail onto the entry
-//       // Mark that this entry is a globstar match
-//       PROCESS(pattern[0..n] + ENTRY + pattern[n .. $], true)
-//
-//   else // not globstar
-//     for ENTRY in ENTRIES (not dotfiles, unless pattern[n] is dot)
-//       Test ENTRY against pattern[n]
-//       If fails, continue
-//       If passes, PROCESS(pattern[0..n] + item + pattern[n+1 .. $])
-//
-// Caveat:
-//   Cache all stats and readdirs results to minimize syscall.  Since all
-//   we ever care about is existence and directory-ness, we can just keep
-//   `true` for files, and [children,...] for directories, or `false` for
-//   things that don't exist.

-# inflight
-
-Add callbacks to requests in flight to avoid async duplication
-
-## USAGE
-
-```javascript
-var inflight = require('inflight')
-
-// some request that does some stuff
-function req(key, callback) {
-  // key is any random string.  like a url or filename or whatever.
-  //
-  // will return either a falsey value, indicating that the
-  // request for this key is already in flight, or a new callback
-  // which when called will call all callbacks passed to inflightk
-  // with the same key
-  callback = inflight(key, callback)
-
-  // If we got a falsey value back, then there's already a req going
-  if (!callback) return
-
-  // this is where you'd fetch the url or whatever
-  // callback is also once()-ified, so it can safely be assigned
-  // to multiple events etc.  First call wins.
-  setTimeout(function() {
-    callback(null, key)
-  }, 100)
-}
-
-// only assigns a single setTimeout
-// when it dings, all cbs get called
-req('foo', cb1)
-req('foo', cb2)
-req('foo', cb3)
-req('foo', cb4)
-```

+
+> [ANSI escape codes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#Colors_and_Styles) for styling strings in the terminal
+
+You probably want the higher-level [chalk](https://github.com/chalk/chalk) module for styling your strings.
+
+<img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/chalk/ansi-styles/8261697c95bf34b6c7767e2cbe9941a851d59385/screenshot.svg" width="900">
+
+
+## Install
+
+```
+$ npm install ansi-styles
+```
+
+
+## Usage
+
+```js
+const style = require('ansi-styles');
+
+console.log(`${style.green.open}Hello world!${style.green.close}`);
+
+
+// Color conversion between 16/256/truecolor
+// NOTE: If conversion goes to 16 colors or 256 colors, the original color
+//       may be degraded to fit that color palette. This means terminals
+//       that do not support 16 million colors will best-match the
+//       original color.
+console.log(style.bgColor.ansi.hsl(120, 80, 72) + 'Hello world!' + style.bgColor.close);
+console.log(style.color.ansi256.rgb(199, 20, 250) + 'Hello world!' + style.color.close);
+console.log(style.color.ansi16m.hex('#ABCDEF') + 'Hello world!' + style.color.close);
+```
+
+## API
+
+Each style has an `open` and `close` property.
+
+
+## Styles
+
+### Modifiers
+
+- `reset`
+- `bold`
+- `dim`
+- `italic` *(Not widely supported)*
+- `underline`
+- `inverse`
+- `hidden`
+- `strikethrough` *(Not widely supported)*
+
+### Colors
+
+- `black`
+- `red`
+- `green`
+- `yellow`
+- `blue`
+- `magenta`
+- `cyan`
+- `white`
+- `gray` ("bright black")
+- `redBright`
+- `greenBright`
+- `yellowBright`
+- `blueBright`
+- `magentaBright`
+- `cyanBright`
+- `whiteBright`
+
+### Background colors
+
+- `bgBlack`
+- `bgRed`
+- `bgGreen`
+- `bgYellow`
+- `bgBlue`
+- `bgMagenta`
+- `bgCyan`
+- `bgWhite`
+- `bgBlackBright`
+- `bgRedBright`
+- `bgGreenBright`
+- `bgYellowBright`
+- `bgBlueBright`
+- `bgMagentaBright`
+- `bgCyanBright`
+- `bgWhiteBright`
+
+
+## Advanced usage
+
+By default, you get a map of styles, but the styles are also available as groups. They are non-enumerable so they don't show up unless you access them explicitly. This makes it easier to expose only a subset in a higher-level module.
+
+- `style.modifier`
+- `style.color`
+- `style.bgColor`
+
+###### Example
+
+```js
+console.log(style.color.green.open);
+```
+
+Raw escape codes (i.e. without the CSI escape prefix `\u001B[` and render mode postfix `m`) are available under `style.codes`, which returns a `Map` with the open codes as keys and close codes as values.
+
+###### Example
+
+```js
+console.log(style.codes.get(36));
+//=> 39
+```
+
+
+## [256 / 16 million (TrueColor) support](https://gist.github.com/XVilka/8346728)
+
+`ansi-styles` uses the [`color-convert`](https://github.com/Qix-/color-convert) package to allow for converting between various colors and ANSI escapes, with support for 256 and 16 million colors.
+
+To use these, call the associated conversion function with the intended output, for example:
+
+```js
+style.color.ansi.rgb(100, 200, 15); // RGB to 16 color ansi foreground code
+style.bgColor.ansi.rgb(100, 200, 15); // RGB to 16 color ansi background code
+
+style.color.ansi256.hsl(120, 100, 60); // HSL to 256 color ansi foreground code
+style.bgColor.ansi256.hsl(120, 100, 60); // HSL to 256 color ansi foreground code
+
+style.color.ansi16m.hex('#C0FFEE'); // Hex (RGB) to 16 million color foreground code
+style.bgColor.ansi16m.hex('#C0FFEE'); // Hex (RGB) to 16 million color background code
+```

+
+## Install
+
+```console

+
+
+## Usage
+
+```js
+const chalk = require('chalk');
+
+console.log(chalk.blue('Hello world!'));
+```
+
+Chalk comes with an easy to use composable API where you just chain and nest the styles you want.
+
+```js
+const chalk = require('chalk');
+const log = console.log;
+
+// Combine styled and normal strings
+log(chalk.blue('Hello') + ' World' + chalk.red('!'));
+
+// Compose multiple styles using the chainable API
+log(chalk.blue.bgRed.bold('Hello world!'));
+
+// Pass in multiple arguments
+log(chalk.blue('Hello', 'World!', 'Foo', 'bar', 'biz', 'baz'));
+
+// Nest styles
+log(chalk.red('Hello', chalk.underline.bgBlue('world') + '!'));
+
+// Nest styles of the same type even (color, underline, background)
+log(chalk.green(
+	'I am a green line ' +
+	chalk.blue.underline.bold('with a blue substring') +
+	' that becomes green again!'
+));
+
+// ES2015 template literal
+log(`
+CPU: ${chalk.red('90%')}
+RAM: ${chalk.green('40%')}
+DISK: ${chalk.yellow('70%')}
+`);
+
+// ES2015 tagged template literal
+log(chalk`
+CPU: {red ${cpu.totalPercent}%}
+RAM: {green ${ram.used / ram.total * 100}%}
+DISK: {rgb(255,131,0) ${disk.used / disk.total * 100}%}
+`);
+
+// Use RGB colors in terminal emulators that support it.
+log(chalk.keyword('orange')('Yay for orange colored text!'));
+log(chalk.rgb(123, 45, 67).underline('Underlined reddish color'));
+log(chalk.hex('#DEADED').bold('Bold gray!'));
+```
+
+Easily define your own themes:
+
+```js
+const chalk = require('chalk');
+
+const error = chalk.bold.red;
+const warning = chalk.keyword('orange');
+
+console.log(error('Error!'));
+console.log(warning('Warning!'));
+```
+
+Take advantage of console.log [string substitution](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/console.html#console_console_log_data_args):
+
+```js
+const name = 'Sindre';
+console.log(chalk.green('Hello %s'), name);
+//=> 'Hello Sindre'
+```
+
+
+## API
+
+### chalk.`<style>[.<style>...](string, [string...])`
+
+Example: `chalk.red.bold.underline('Hello', 'world');`
+
+Chain [styles](#styles) and call the last one as a method with a string argument. Order doesn't matter, and later styles take precedent in case of a conflict. This simply means that `chalk.red.yellow.green` is equivalent to `chalk.green`.
+
+Multiple arguments will be separated by space.
+
+### chalk.enabled
+
+Color support is automatically detected, as is the level (see `chalk.level`). However, if you'd like to simply enable/disable Chalk, you can do so via the `.enabled` property.
+
+Chalk is enabled by default unless explicitly disabled via the constructor or `chalk.level` is `0`.
+
+If you need to change this in a reusable module, create a new instance:
+
+```js
+const ctx = new chalk.constructor({enabled: false});
+```
+
+### chalk.level
+
+Color support is automatically detected, but you can override it by setting the `level` property. You should however only do this in your own code as it applies globally to all Chalk consumers.
+
+If you need to change this in a reusable module, create a new instance:
+
+```js
+const ctx = new chalk.constructor({level: 0});
+```
+
+Levels are as follows:
+
+0. All colors disabled
+1. Basic color support (16 colors)
+2. 256 color support
+3. Truecolor support (16 million colors)
+
+### chalk.supportsColor
+
+Detect whether the terminal [supports color](https://github.com/chalk/supports-color). Used internally and handled for you, but exposed for convenience.
+
+Can be overridden by the user with the flags `--color` and `--no-color`. For situations where using `--color` is not possible, add the environment variable `FORCE_COLOR=1` to forcefully enable color or `FORCE_COLOR=0` to forcefully disable. The use of `FORCE_COLOR` overrides all other color support checks.
+
+Explicit 256/Truecolor mode can be enabled using the `--color=256` and `--color=16m` flags, respectively.

+
+## Tagged template literal
+
+Chalk can be used as a [tagged template literal](http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_template-literals.html#_tagged-template-literals).
+
+```js
+const chalk = require('chalk');
+
+const miles = 18;
+const calculateFeet = miles => miles * 5280;
+
+console.log(chalk`
+  There are {bold 5280 feet} in a mile.
+  In {bold ${miles} miles}, there are {green.bold ${calculateFeet(miles)} feet}.
+`);
+```
+
+Blocks are delimited by an opening curly brace (`{`), a style, some content, and a closing curly brace (`}`).
+
+Template styles are chained exactly like normal Chalk styles. The following two statements are equivalent:
+
+```js
+console.log(chalk.bold.rgb(10, 100, 200)('Hello!'));
+console.log(chalk`{bold.rgb(10,100,200) Hello!}`);
+```
+
+Note that function styles (`rgb()`, `hsl()`, `keyword()`, etc.) may not contain spaces between parameters.
+
+All interpolated values (`` chalk`${foo}` ``) are converted to strings via the `.toString()` method. All curly braces (`{` and `}`) in interpolated value strings are escaped.
+
+
+## 256 and Truecolor color support
+
+Chalk supports 256 colors and [Truecolor](https://gist.github.com/XVilka/8346728) (16 million colors) on supported terminal apps.
+
+Colors are downsampled from 16 million RGB values to an ANSI color format that is supported by the terminal emulator (or by specifying `{level: n}` as a Chalk option). For example, Chalk configured to run at level 1 (basic color support) will downsample an RGB value of #FF0000 (red) to 31 (ANSI escape for red).
+
+Examples:
+
+- `chalk.hex('#DEADED').underline('Hello, world!')`
+- `chalk.keyword('orange')('Some orange text')`
+- `chalk.rgb(15, 100, 204).inverse('Hello!')`
+
+Background versions of these models are prefixed with `bg` and the first level of the module capitalized (e.g. `keyword` for foreground colors and `bgKeyword` for background colors).
+
+- `chalk.bgHex('#DEADED').underline('Hello, world!')`
+- `chalk.bgKeyword('orange')('Some orange text')`
+- `chalk.bgRgb(15, 100, 204).inverse('Hello!')`
+
+The following color models can be used:
+
+- [`rgb`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model) - Example: `chalk.rgb(255, 136, 0).bold('Orange!')`
+- [`hex`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#Hex_triplet) - Example: `chalk.hex('#FF8800').bold('Orange!')`
+- [`keyword`](https://www.w3.org/wiki/CSS/Properties/color/keywords) (CSS keywords) - Example: `chalk.keyword('orange').bold('Orange!')`
+- [`hsl`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV) - Example: `chalk.hsl(32, 100, 50).bold('Orange!')`
+- [`hsv`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV) - Example: `chalk.hsv(32, 100, 100).bold('Orange!')`
+- [`hwb`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HWB_color_model)  - Example: `chalk.hwb(32, 0, 50).bold('Orange!')`
+- `ansi16`
+- `ansi256`
+
+
+## Windows
+
+If you're on Windows, do yourself a favor and use [`cmder`](http://cmder.net/) instead of `cmd.exe`.
+
+
+## Origin story
+
+[colors.js](https://github.com/Marak/colors.js) used to be the most popular string styling module, but it has serious deficiencies like extending `String.prototype` which causes all kinds of [problems](https://github.com/yeoman/yo/issues/68) and the package is unmaintained. Although there are other packages, they either do too much or not enough. Chalk is a clean and focused alternative.

+# color-convert
+
+[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Qix-/color-convert.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Qix-/color-convert)
+
+Color-convert is a color conversion library for JavaScript and node.
+It converts all ways between `rgb`, `hsl`, `hsv`, `hwb`, `cmyk`, `ansi`, `ansi16`, `hex` strings, and CSS `keyword`s (will round to closest):
+
+```js
+var convert = require('color-convert');
+
+convert.rgb.hsl(140, 200, 100);             // [96, 48, 59]
+convert.keyword.rgb('blue');                // [0, 0, 255]
+
+var rgbChannels = convert.rgb.channels;     // 3
+var cmykChannels = convert.cmyk.channels;   // 4
+var ansiChannels = convert.ansi16.channels; // 1
+```
+
+# Install
+
+```console
+$ npm install color-convert
+```
+
+# API
+
+Simply get the property of the _from_ and _to_ conversion that you're looking for.
+
+All functions have a rounded and unrounded variant. By default, return values are rounded. To get the unrounded (raw) results, simply tack on `.raw` to the function.
+
+All 'from' functions have a hidden property called `.channels` that indicates the number of channels the function expects (not including alpha).
+
+```js
+var convert = require('color-convert');
+
+// Hex to LAB
+convert.hex.lab('DEADBF');         // [ 76, 21, -2 ]
+convert.hex.lab.raw('DEADBF');     // [ 75.56213190997677, 20.653827952644754, -2.290532499330533 ]
+
+// RGB to CMYK
+convert.rgb.cmyk(167, 255, 4);     // [ 35, 0, 98, 0 ]
+convert.rgb.cmyk.raw(167, 255, 4); // [ 34.509803921568626, 0, 98.43137254901961, 0 ]
+```
+
+### Arrays
+All functions that accept multiple arguments also support passing an array.
+
+Note that this does **not** apply to functions that convert from a color that only requires one value (e.g. `keyword`, `ansi256`, `hex`, etc.)
+
+```js
+var convert = require('color-convert');
+
+convert.rgb.hex(123, 45, 67);      // '7B2D43'
+convert.rgb.hex([123, 45, 67]);    // '7B2D43'
+```
+
+## Routing
+
+Conversions that don't have an _explicitly_ defined conversion (in [conversions.js](conversions.js)), but can be converted by means of sub-conversions (e.g. XYZ -> **RGB** -> CMYK), are automatically routed together. This allows just about any color model supported by `color-convert` to be converted to any other model, so …
