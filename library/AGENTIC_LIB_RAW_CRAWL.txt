intentïon agentic-lib
You probably want to start with the workflow documentation here: WORKFLOWS-README.md
The intentïon agentic-lib is a collection of reusable GitHub Actions workflows that enable your
repository to operate in an “agentic” manner. In our system, autonomous workflows communicate through branches and
issues to continuously review, fix, update, and evolve your code. Each workflow is designed to be invoked using
GitHub’s workflow_call event, so they can be composed together like an SDK.

Component Breakdown
This repository is organized into three distinct areas to help you understand the purpose and maturity level of each component:
1. Re‑usable Workflows (Core Functionality)

Purpose:
These workflows form the backbone of the agentic‑lib system, enabling automated coding processes such as testing, publishing, and issue management.
Stability:
They are stable and well‑tested, designed to be integrated into your CI/CD pipelines.
Licensing:
The core workflows are released under GPL‑3 and include an attribution requirement for any derived work.
Location:
Find these in the .github/workflows/ directory.

2. Example Workflows (Demonstrative Content)

Purpose:
These files provide practical examples of how to use the core workflows. They serve as learning tools and reference implementations.
Stability:
While functional, they are intended primarily for demonstration and experimentation.
Licensing:
The example workflows are covered by the MIT license to allow for broader use and modification.
Location:
Look in the examples/ directory for sample implementations.

3. The Evolving main.js (JavaScript re‑implementation of Re‑usable Workflows)


Purpose:
This file implements the Re‑usable Workflows above as a JavaScript module, enabling programmatic access to the core functionality. It now also tracks each successful invocation of the agentic command using an internal counter for improved observability.


Batch Processing:
The agenticHandler function supports batch processing by accepting a payload with a commands array. Each command is validated and processed sequentially. On success, each command is individually logged and the global invocation counter (globalThis.callCount) is incremented accordingly. The aggregated response contains a list of individual results.
Optional Batch Throttling:
You can limit the maximum number of commands processed in a batch by setting the environment variable MAX_BATCH_COMMANDS. When set, if the number of commands exceeds this limit, the batch will be rejected with an error message.


Execution Timing:
For enhanced performance insights, the response of agenticHandler now includes an executionTimeMS field for each command, indicating the processing time in milliseconds.


Note on Prompt Validity:
The agentic library expects actionable prompts. Non-actionable inputs such as 'NaN', empty strings, or improperly formatted commands are logged as errors and rejected. Inputs are processed by trimming whitespace. Therefore, even if the input appears in a different case (e.g., ' nan ', 'NaN', ' NAn '), it will be considered non-actionable and will result in an error message explicitly stating that the input is non-actionable because it is equivalent to 'NaN'.


Command Aliases:
The agentic library also supports command alias substitution. If the environment variable COMMAND_ALIASES is set with a JSON mapping (for example, { "ls": "list", "rm": "remove" }), any command matching an alias will be automatically replaced with its corresponding command before processing.


Stability:
It is under active development and may change frequently. It represents bleeding‑edge functionality that might not yet be production‑ready.


Licensing:
As part of the core project, it is under GPL‑3 with the attribution clause.


Location:
The code is located in src/lib/main.js.



Agentic Library Functions
A new set of agentic library functions have been implemented to enable autonomous workflow invocation. The primary function, agenticHandler, processes a JSON payload containing either a single command or a batch of commands. When using batch processing, supply a JSON payload with a commands array property. When a valid command is processed, the internal invocation counter is incremented and an executionTimeMS property indicates its processing time in milliseconds.
It can be invoked directly via the CLI using the --agentic flag followed by a JSON payload, e.g.,
node src/lib/main.js --agentic '{"command": "doSomething"}'

Or for batch processing:
node src/lib/main.js --agentic '{"commands": ["cmd1", "cmd2"]}'

A new CLI flag has been added for dry runs:
node src/lib/main.js --dry-run

Additionally, the CLI now supports additional commands:

--version: Displays version information from package.json along with a timestamp.
--verbose: Activates detailed logging for debugging purposes.
--diagnostics: Outputs an in‑depth diagnostic report, including the current configuration, Node.js version, and relevant environment variables.
--status: Outputs a runtime health summary in JSON format including configuration, Node.js version, callCount, uptime, and select environment variables.
--digest: Initiates processing of a sample digest event.
--simulate-error: Simulates an error scenario for testing purposes by immediately logging a simulated error and exiting with a non-zero status code.
--simulate-delay <ms>: Delays execution for the specified number of milliseconds, simulating processing latency before executing further commands.
--simulate-load <ms>: Simulates a heavy processing load by executing a CPU‑intensive loop for the specified duration in milliseconds.
--apply-fix: Applies automated fixes and logs a success message indicating "Applied fix successfully". Execution stops immediately after this action.
--cli-utils: NEW. Displays a comprehensive summary of all CLI commands available along with brief descriptions. Use this flag to quickly view all command options.


AWS Integrations
The agentic‑lib library leverages AWS services to enhance automation and reliability:


SQS Integration:

The function createSQSEventFromDigest constructs a mock AWS SQS event from a given digest, formatting the payload to resemble a typical SQS message.
The digestLambdaHandler function processes incoming SQS events, gracefully handling JSON parsing errors and accumulating failed records. If a messageId is omitted, a fallback identifier is generated.
These integrations ensure that messages can be retried by AWS SQS in case of processing errors, thereby enhancing fault tolerance.



Logging:

Detailed logging via logInfo and logError functions provides insight into the operations, including configurations and error stacks when verbose mode is enabled.




CLI Behavior
The CLI provides several flags to manage the library's operation:

--help:

Displays usage instructions and available command line flags.


--digest:

Initiates the processing of a sample digest by creating a simulated SQS event and handling it through the AWS‑integrated lambda handler.


--agentic:

Processes an agentic command. Supply a payload with either a single command property or a commands array for batch processing. Each valid command increments the internal invocation counter and returns an executionTimeMS property indicating its processing time.


--version:

Displays version information from package.json along with a timestamp in JSON format.


--verbose:

Activates detailed logging for debugging purposes.


--diagnostics:

Outputs an in‑depth diagnostic report, including the current configuration, Node.js version, and relevant environment variables.


--status:

Outputs a runtime health summary in JSON format including configuration, Node.js version, callCount, uptime, and select environment variables.


--dry-run:

Executes a dry run that simulates the command execution without performing any actions.


--simulate-error:

Simulates an error scenario for testing purposes by immediately logging a simulated error and exiting with a non-zero status code.


--simulate-delay :

Delays execution for the specified number of milliseconds, simulating processing latency before executing any further commands.


--simulate-load :

Simulates a heavy processing load by executing a CPU‑intensive loop for the specified duration in milliseconds.


--apply-fix:

Applies automated fixes and logs a success message.


--cli-utils:

Displays a summary of available CLI commands along with brief descriptions.

You probably want to start with the workflow documentation here: WORKFLOWS-README.md
The intentïon agentic-lib is a collection of reusable GitHub Actions workflows that enable your
repository to operate in an “agentic” manner. In our system, autonomous workflows communicate through branches and
issues to continuously review, fix, update, and evolve your code. Each workflow is designed to be invoked using
GitHub’s workflow_call event, so they can be composed together like an SDK.

This README file will evolve as the test experiment within this repository evolves.

Component Breakdown
This repository is organized into three distinct areas to help you understand the purpose and maturity level of each component:
1. Re‑usable Workflows (Core Functionality)

Purpose:
These workflows form the backbone of the agentic‑lib system, enabling automated coding processes such as testing, publishing, and issue management.
Stability:
They are stable and well‑tested, designed to be integrated into your CI/CD pipelines.
Licensing:
The core workflows are released under GPL‑3 and include an attribution requirement for any derived work.
Location:
Find these in the .github/workflows/ directory.

2. Example Workflows (Demonstrative Content)

Purpose:
These files provide practical examples of how to use the core workflows. They serve as learning tools and reference implementations.
Stability:
While functional, they are intended primarily for demonstration and experimentation.
Licensing:
The example workflows are covered by the MIT license to allow for broader use and modification.
Location:
Look in the examples/ directory for sample implementations.

3. The Evolving main.js (JavaScript re‑implementation of Re‑usable Workflows)


Purpose:
This file implements the Re‑usable Workflows above as a JavaScript module, enabling programmatic access to the core functionality. It now also tracks each successful invocation of the agentic command using an internal counter for improved observability.


Batch Processing:
The agenticHandler function supports batch processing by accepting a payload with a commands array. Each command is validated and processed sequentially. On success, each command is individually logged and the global invocation counter (globalThis.callCount) is incremented accordingly. The aggregated response contains a list of individual results.
Optional Batch Throttling:
You can limit the maximum number of commands processed in a batch by setting the environment variable MAX_BATCH_COMMANDS. When set, if the number of commands exceeds this limit, the batch will be rejected with an error message.


Execution Timing:
For enhanced performance insights, the response of agenticHandler now includes an executionTimeMS field for each command, indicating the processing time in milliseconds.


Note on Prompt Validity:
The agentic library expects actionable prompts. Non-actionable inputs such as 'NaN', empty strings, or improperly formatted commands are logged as errors and rejected. Inputs are processed by trimming whitespace. Therefore, even if the input appears in a different case (e.g., ' nan ', 'NaN', ' NAn '), it will be considered non-actionable and will result in an error message explicitly stating that the input is non-actionable because it is equivalent to 'NaN'.


Command Aliases:
The agentic library also supports command alias substitution. If the environment variable COMMAND_ALIASES is set with a JSON mapping (for example, { "ls": "list", "rm": "remove" }), any command matching an alias will be automatically replaced with its corresponding command before processing.


Stability:
It is under active development and may change frequently. It represents bleeding‑edge functionality that might not yet be production‑ready.


Licensing:
As part of the core project, it is under GPL‑3 with the attribution clause.


Location:
The code is located in src/lib/main.js.



Agentic Library Functions
A new set of agentic library functions have been implemented to enable autonomous workflow invocation. The primary function, agenticHandler, processes a JSON payload containing either a single command or a batch of commands. When using batch processing, supply a JSON payload with a commands array property. When a valid command is processed, the internal invocation counter is incremented and an executionTimeMS property indicates its processing time in milliseconds.
It can be invoked directly via the CLI using the --agentic flag followed by a JSON payload, e.g.,
node src/lib/main.js --agentic '{"command": "doSomething"}'

Or for batch processing:
node src/lib/main.js --agentic '{"commands": ["cmd1", "cmd2"]}'

A new CLI flag has been added for dry runs:
node src/lib/main.js --dry-run

Additionally, the CLI now supports additional commands:

--version: Displays version information from package.json along with a timestamp.
--verbose: Activates detailed logging for debugging purposes.
--diagnostics: Outputs an in‑depth diagnostic report, including the current configuration, Node.js version, and relevant environment variables.
--status: Outputs a runtime health summary in JSON format including configuration, Node.js version, callCount, uptime, and select environment variables.
--digest: Initiates processing of a sample digest event.
--simulate-error: Simulates an error scenario for testing purposes by immediately logging a simulated error and exiting with a non-zero status code.
--simulate-delay <ms>: Delays execution for the specified number of milliseconds, simulating processing latency before executing further commands.
--simulate-load <ms>: Simulates a heavy processing load by executing a CPU‑intensive loop for the specified duration in milliseconds.
--apply-fix: Applies automated fixes and logs a success message indicating "Applied fix successfully". Execution stops immediately after this action.
--cli-utils: NEW. Displays a comprehensive summary of all CLI commands available along with brief descriptions. Use this flag to quickly view all command options.


AWS Integrations
The agentic‑lib library leverages AWS services to enhance automation and reliability:


SQS Integration:

The function createSQSEventFromDigest constructs a mock AWS SQS event from a given digest, formatting the payload to resemble a typical SQS message.
The digestLambdaHandler function processes incoming SQS events, gracefully handling JSON parsing errors and accumulating failed records. If a messageId is omitted, a fallback identifier is generated.
These integrations ensure that messages can be retried by AWS SQS in case of processing errors, thereby enhancing fault tolerance.



Logging:

Detailed logging via logInfo and logError functions provides insight into the operations, including configurations and error stacks when verbose mode is enabled.




CLI Behavior
The CLI provides several flags to manage the library's operation:

--help:

Displays usage instructions and available command line flags.


--digest:

Initiates the processing of a sample digest by creating a simulated SQS event and handling it through the AWS‑integrated lambda handler.


--agentic:

Processes an agentic command. Supply a payload with either a single command property or a commands array for batch processing. Each valid command increments the internal invocation counter and returns an executionTimeMS property indicating its processing time.


--version:

Displays version information from package.json along with a timestamp in JSON format.


--verbose:

Activates detailed logging for debugging purposes.


--diagnostics:

Outputs an in‑depth diagnostic report, including the current configuration, Node.js version, and relevant environment variables.


--status:

Outputs a runtime health summary in JSON format including configuration, Node.js version, callCount, uptime, and select environment variables.


--dry-run:

Executes a dry run that simulates the command execution without performing any actions.


--simulate-error:

Simulates an error scenario for testing purposes by immediately logging a simulated error and exiting with a non-zero status code.


--simulate-delay :

Delays execution for the specified number of milliseconds, simulating processing latency before executing any further commands.


--simulate-load :

Simulates a heavy processing load by executing a CPU‑intensive loop for the specified duration in milliseconds.


--apply-fix:

Applies automated fixes and logs a success message.


--cli-utils:

Displays a summary of available CLI commands along with brief descriptions.

You probably want to start with the workflow documentation here: WORKFLOWS-README.md
The intentïon agentic-lib is a collection of reusable GitHub Actions workflows that enable your
repository to operate in an “agentic” manner. In our system, autonomous workflows communicate through branches and
issues to continuously review, fix, update, and evolve your code. Each workflow is designed to be invoked using
GitHub’s workflow_call event, so they can be composed together like an SDK.

This file is part of the example suite for agentic-lib see: https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib
This file is licensed under the MIT License. For details, see LICENSE-MIT

This README file will evolve as the test experiment within this repository evolves.

Component Breakdown
This repository is organized into three distinct areas to help you understand the purpose and maturity level of each component:
1. Re‑usable Workflows (Core Functionality)

Purpose:
These workflows form the backbone of the agentic‑lib system, enabling automated coding processes such as testing, publishing, and issue management.
Stability:
They are stable and well‑tested, designed to be integrated into your CI/CD pipelines.
Licensing:
The core workflows are released under GPL‑3 and include an attribution requirement for any derived work.
Location:
Find these in the .github/workflows/ directory.

2. Example Workflows (Demonstrative Content)

Purpose:
These files provide practical examples of how to use the core workflows. They serve as learning tools and reference implementations.
Stability:
While functional, they are intended primarily for demonstration and experimentation.
Licensing:
The example workflows are covered by the MIT license to allow for broader use and modification.
Location:
Look in the examples/ directory for sample implementations.

3. The Evolving main.js (JavaScript re‑implementation of Re‑usable Workflows)


Purpose:
This file implements the Re‑usable Workflows above as a JavaScript module, enabling programmatic access to the core functionality. It now also tracks each successful invocation of the agentic command using an internal counter for improved observability.


Batch Processing:
The agenticHandler function supports batch processing by accepting a payload with a commands array. Each command is validated and processed sequentially. On success, each command is individually logged and the global invocation counter (globalThis.callCount) is incremented accordingly. The aggregated response contains a list of individual results.
Optional Batch Throttling:
You can limit the maximum number of commands processed in a batch by setting the environment variable MAX_BATCH_COMMANDS. When set, if the number of commands exceeds this limit, the batch will be rejected with an error message.


Execution Timing:
For enhanced performance insights, the response of agenticHandler now includes an executionTimeMS field for each command, indicating the processing time in milliseconds.


Note on Prompt Validity:
The agentic library expects actionable prompts. Non-actionable inputs such as 'NaN', empty strings, or improperly formatted commands are logged as errors and rejected. Inputs are processed by trimming whitespace. Therefore, even if the input appears in a different case (e.g., ' nan ', 'NaN', ' NAn '), it will be considered non-actionable and will result in an error message explicitly stating that the input is non-actionable because it is equivalent to 'NaN'.


Command Aliases:
The agentic library also supports command alias substitution. If the environment variable COMMAND_ALIASES is set with a JSON mapping (for example, { "ls": "list", "rm": "remove" }), any command matching an alias will be automatically replaced with its corresponding command before processing.


Stability:
It is under active development and may change frequently. It represents bleeding‑edge functionality that might not yet be production‑ready.


Licensing:
As part of the core project, it is under GPL‑3 with the attribution clause.


Location:
The code is located in src/lib/main.js.



Agentic Library Functions
A new set of agentic library functions have been implemented to enable autonomous workflow invocation. The primary function, agenticHandler, processes a JSON payload containing either a single command or a batch of commands. When using batch processing, supply a JSON payload with a commands array property. When a valid command is processed, the internal invocation counter is incremented and an executionTimeMS property indicates its processing time in milliseconds.
It can be invoked directly via the CLI using the --agentic flag followed by a JSON payload, e.g.,
node src/lib/main.js --agentic '{"command": "doSomething"}'

Or for batch processing:
node src/lib/main.js --agentic '{"commands": ["cmd1", "cmd2"]}'

A new CLI flag has been added for dry runs:
node src/lib/main.js --dry-run

Additionally, the CLI now supports additional commands:

--version: Displays version information from package.json along with a timestamp.
--verbose: Activates detailed logging for debugging purposes.
--diagnostics: Outputs an in‑depth diagnostic report, including the current configuration, Node.js version, and relevant environment variables.
--status: Outputs a runtime health summary in JSON format including configuration, Node.js version, callCount, uptime, and select environment variables.
--digest: Initiates processing of a sample digest event.
--simulate-error: Simulates an error scenario for testing purposes by immediately logging a simulated error and exiting with a non-zero status code.
--simulate-delay <ms>: Delays execution for the specified number of milliseconds, simulating processing latency before executing further commands.
--simulate-load <ms>: Simulates a heavy processing load by executing a CPU‑intensive loop for the specified duration in milliseconds.
--apply-fix: Applies automated fixes and logs a success message indicating "Applied fix successfully". Execution stops immediately after this action.
--cli-utils: NEW. Displays a comprehensive summary of all CLI commands available along with brief descriptions. Use this flag to quickly view all command options.


AWS Integrations
The agentic‑lib library leverages AWS services to enhance automation and reliability:


SQS Integration:

The function createSQSEventFromDigest constructs a mock AWS SQS event from a given digest, formatting the payload to resemble a typical SQS message.
The digestLambdaHandler function processes incoming SQS events, gracefully handling JSON parsing errors and accumulating failed records. If a messageId is omitted, a fallback identifier is generated.
These integrations ensure that messages can be retried by AWS SQS in case of processing errors, thereby enhancing fault tolerance.



Logging:

Detailed logging via logInfo and logError functions provides insight into the operations, including configurations and error stacks when verbose mode is enabled.




CLI Behavior
The CLI provides several flags to manage the library's operation:

--help:

Displays usage instructions and available command line flags.


--digest:

Initiates the processing of a sample digest by creating a simulated SQS event and handling it through the AWS‑integrated lambda handler.


--agentic:

Processes an agentic command. Supply a payload with either a single command property or a commands array for batch processing. Each valid command increments the internal invocation counter and returns an executionTimeMS property indicating its processing time.


--version:

Displays version information from package.json along with a timestamp in JSON format.


--verbose:

Activates detailed logging for debugging purposes.


--diagnostics:

Outputs an in‑depth diagnostic report, including the current configuration, Node.js version, and relevant environment variables.


--status:

Outputs a runtime health summary in JSON format including configuration, Node.js version, callCount, uptime, and select environment variables.


--dry-run:

Executes a dry run that simulates the command execution without performing any actions.


--simulate-error:

Simulates an error scenario for testing purposes by immediately logging a simulated error and exiting with a non-zero status code.


--simulate-delay :

Delays execution for the specified number of milliseconds, simulating processing latency before executing any further commands.


--simulate-load :

Simulates a heavy processing load by executing a CPU‑intensive loop for the specified duration in milliseconds.


--apply-fix:

Applies automated fixes and logs a success message.


--cli-utils:

Displays a summary of available CLI commands along with brief descriptions.

You probably want to start with the workflow documentation here: WORKFLOWS-README.md
The intentïon agentic-lib is a collection of reusable GitHub Actions workflows that enable your
repository to operate in an “agentic” manner. In our system, autonomous workflows communicate through branches and
issues to continuously review, fix, update, and evolve your code. Each workflow is designed to be invoked using
GitHub’s workflow_call event, so they can be composed together like an SDK.

This README file will evolve as the test experiment within this repository evolves.

Component Breakdown
This repository is organized into three distinct areas to help you understand the purpose and maturity level of each component:
1. Re‑usable Workflows (Core Functionality)

Purpose:
These workflows form the backbone of the agentic‑lib system, enabling automated coding processes such as testing, publishing, and issue management.
Stability:
They are stable and well‑tested, designed to be integrated into your CI/CD pipelines.
Licensing:
The core workflows are released under GPL‑3 and include an attribution requirement for any derived work.
Location:
Find these in the .github/workflows/ directory.

2. Example Workflows (Demonstrative Content)

Purpose:
These files provide practical examples of how to use the core workflows. They serve as learning tools and reference implementations.
Stability:
While functional, they are intended primarily for demonstration and experimentation.
Licensing:
The example workflows are covered by the MIT license to allow for broader use and modification.
Location:
Look in the examples/ directory for sample implementations.

3. The Evolving main.js (JavaScript re‑implementation of Re‑usable Workflows)


Purpose:
This file implements the Re‑usable Workflows above as a JavaScript module, enabling programmatic access to the core functionality. It now also tracks each successful invocation of the agentic command using an internal counter for improved observability.


Batch Processing:
The agenticHandler function supports batch processing by accepting a payload with a commands array. Each command is validated and processed sequentially. On success, each command is individually logged and the global invocation counter (globalThis.callCount) is incremented accordingly. The aggregated response contains a list of individual results.
Optional Batch Throttling:
You can limit the maximum number of commands processed in a batch by setting the environment variable MAX_BATCH_COMMANDS. When set, if the number of commands exceeds this limit, the batch will be rejected with an error message.


Execution Timing:
For enhanced performance insights, the response of agenticHandler now includes an executionTimeMS field for each command, indicating the processing time in milliseconds.


Note on Prompt Validity:
The agentic library expects actionable prompts. Non-actionable inputs such as 'NaN', empty strings, or improperly formatted commands are logged as errors and rejected. Inputs are processed by trimming whitespace. Therefore, even if the input appears in a different case (e.g., ' nan ', 'NaN', ' NAn '), it will be considered non-actionable and will result in an error message explicitly stating that the input is non-actionable because it is equivalent to 'NaN'.


Command Aliases:
The agentic library also supports command alias substitution. If the environment variable COMMAND_ALIASES is set with a JSON mapping (for example, { "ls": "list", "rm": "remove" }), any command matching an alias will be automatically replaced with its corresponding command before processing.


Stability:
It is under active development and may change frequently. It represents bleeding‑edge functionality that might not yet be production‑ready.


Licensing:
As part of the core project, it is under GPL‑3 with the attribution clause.


Location:
The code is located in src/lib/main.js.



Agentic Library Functions
A new set of agentic library functions have been implemented to enable autonomous workflow invocation. The primary function, agenticHandler, processes a JSON payload containing either a single command or a batch of commands. When using batch processing, supply a JSON payload with a commands array property. When a valid command is processed, the internal invocation counter is incremented and an executionTimeMS property indicates its processing time in milliseconds.
It can be invoked directly via the CLI using the --agentic flag followed by a JSON payload, e.g.,
node src/lib/main.js --agentic '{"command": "doSomething"}'

Or for batch processing:
node src/lib/main.js --agentic '{"commands": ["cmd1", "cmd2"]}'

A new CLI flag has been added for dry runs:
node src/lib/main.js --dry-run

Additionally, the CLI now supports additional commands:

--version: Displays version information from package.json along with a timestamp.
--verbose: Activates detailed logging for debugging purposes.
--diagnostics: Outputs an in‑depth diagnostic report, including the current configuration, Node.js version, and relevant environment variables.
--status: Outputs a runtime health summary in JSON format including configuration, Node.js version, callCount, uptime, and select environment variables.
--digest: Initiates processing of a sample digest event.
--simulate-error: Simulates an error scenario for testing purposes by immediately logging a simulated error and exiting with a non-zero status code.
--simulate-delay <ms>: Delays execution for the specified number of milliseconds, simulating processing latency before executing further commands.
--simulate-load <ms>: Simulates a heavy processing load by executing a CPU‑intensive loop for the specified duration in milliseconds.
--apply-fix: Applies automated fixes and logs a success message indicating "Applied fix successfully". Execution stops immediately after this action.
--cli-utils: NEW. Displays a comprehensive summary of all CLI commands available along with brief descriptions. Use this flag to quickly view all command options.


AWS Integrations
The agentic‑lib library leverages AWS services to enhance automation and reliability:


SQS Integration:

The function createSQSEventFromDigest constructs a mock AWS SQS event from a given digest, formatting the payload to resemble a typical SQS message.
The digestLambdaHandler function processes incoming SQS events, gracefully handling JSON parsing errors and accumulating failed records. If a messageId is omitted, a fallback identifier is generated.
These integrations ensure that messages can be retried by AWS SQS in case of processing errors, thereby enhancing fault tolerance.



Logging:

Detailed logging via logInfo and logError functions provides insight into the operations, including configurations and error stacks when verbose mode is enabled.




CLI Behavior
The CLI provides several flags to manage the library's operation:

--help:

Displays usage instructions and available command line flags.


--digest:

Initiates the processing of a sample digest by creating a simulated SQS event and handling it through the AWS‑integrated lambda handler.


--agentic:

Processes an agentic command. Supply a payload with either a single command property or a commands array for batch processing. Each valid command increments the internal invocation counter and returns an executionTimeMS property indicating its processing time.


--version:

Displays version information from package.json along with a timestamp in JSON format.


--verbose:

Activates detailed logging for debugging purposes.


--diagnostics:

Outputs an in‑depth diagnostic report, including the current configuration, Node.js version, and relevant environment variables.


--status:

Outputs a runtime health summary in JSON format including configuration, Node.js version, callCount, uptime, and select environment variables.


--dry-run:

Executes a dry run that simulates the command execution without performing any actions.


--simulate-error:

Simulates an error scenario for testing purposes by immediately logging a simulated error and exiting with a non-zero status code.


--simulate-delay :

Delays execution for the specified number of milliseconds, simulating processing latency before executing any further commands.


--simulate-load :

Simulates a heavy processing load by executing a CPU‑intensive loop for the specified duration in milliseconds.


--apply-fix:

Applies automated fixes and logs a success message.


--cli-utils:

Displays a summary of available CLI commands along with brief descriptions.

Backed by the leaders in AI, GitHub Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With GitHub Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on: value, innovation, and happiness.GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use GitHub Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, GitHub Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, student, faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead. 
What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains, and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create GitHub Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.To generate a code suggestion, the GitHub Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to GitHub Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the GitHub Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to GitHub Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, GitHub Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to GitHub Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.  What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with GitHub Copilot throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft.

The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.How can I upgrade my GitHub Copilot Free license to Copilot Pro?If you're on the Free plan, you can upgrade to Pro through your Copilot settings page or directly on the Copilot marketing page.What is included in GitHub Copilot Free?GitHub Copilot Free users are limited to 2000 completions and 50 chat requests (including Copilot Edits).Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in GitHub Advanced Security and available to all public repositories.PrivacyWhat personal data does GitHub Copilot process?GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:User Engagement Data: This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics. Prompts: These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions. Suggestions: These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts. Feedback Data: This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models. How does GitHub use the Copilot data?How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendationsTroubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-datenessEnhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operationalThese practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement (DPA), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers. GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:Billing and account managementTo comply with and resolve legal obligations For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of serviceTo generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentivesTo produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the GitHub Privacy Statement.How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers? If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows: Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:Prompts and Suggestions: Not retainedUser Engagement Data: Kept for two years.Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.All other GitHub Copilot access and use:Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions. Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a Data Protection Agreement that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals. How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the GitHub Privacy Statement.
Responsible AIWhat are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations. With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a code referencing feature as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or                        idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also                        synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that                        either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including hardcoded credentials, SQL injections, and path injections. Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective                        risk tolerances.As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment for more details.Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with                        disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our feedback forum.Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid                        synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter                        system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found here.Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.GeneralPlans & pricingPrivacyResponsible AIGeneralWhat is GitHub Copilot?GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, GitHub Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With GitHub Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on: value, innovation, and happiness.GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use GitHub Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, GitHub Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, student, faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead. 
What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains, and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create GitHub Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.To generate a code suggestion, the GitHub Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to GitHub Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the GitHub Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to GitHub Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, GitHub Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to GitHub Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.  What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers.

The types of personal data processed may include:User Engagement Data: This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics. Prompts: These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions. Suggestions: These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts. Feedback Data: This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models. How does GitHub use the Copilot data?How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendationsTroubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-datenessEnhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operationalThese practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement (DPA), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers. GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:Billing and account managementTo comply with and resolve legal obligations For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of serviceTo generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentivesTo produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the GitHub Privacy Statement.How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers? If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows: Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:Prompts and Suggestions: Not retainedUser Engagement Data: Kept for two years.Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.All other GitHub Copilot access and use:Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions. Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a Data Protection Agreement that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals. How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the GitHub Privacy Statement.
Responsible AIWhat are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations. With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a code referencing feature as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or                        idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also                        synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that                        either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including hardcoded credentials, SQL injections, and path injections. Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient.

The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment for more details.Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with                        disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our feedback forum.Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid                        synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter                        system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs.

“The new planning and tracking functionality keeps my project management close to my code. I no longer find myself needing to reach for spreadsheets or 3P tools which go stale instantly.Dan GodfreyDevelopment ManagerFlexible project planning for developers Start using projectsContact salesFrequently asked questionsWhat is GitHub Issues?We all need a way to plan our work, track issues, and discuss the things we build. Our answer to this universal question is GitHub Issues, and it’s built-in to every repository. GitHub’s issue tracking is unique because of our focus on simplicity, references, and elegant formatting.With GitHub Issues, you can express ideas with GitHub Flavored Markdown, assign and mention contributors, react with emojis, clarify with attachments and videos, plus reference code like commits, pull requests, and deploys. With task lists, you can break big issues into tasks, further organize your work with milestones and labels, and track relationships and dependencies.We built GitHub Issues for developers. It is simple, adaptable, and powerful.What are Projects?As teams and projects grow, how we work evolves. Tools that hard-code a methodology are too specific and rigid to adapt to any moment. Often, we find ourselves creating a spreadsheet or pulling out a notepad to have the space to think. Then our planning is disconnected from where the work happens.The new Projects connect your planning directly to the work your teams are doing and flexibly adapt to whatever your team needs at any point. Built like a spreadsheet, project tables give you a live canvas to filter, sort, and group issues and pull requests. You can use it, or the accompanying project board, along with custom fields, to track a sprint, plan a feature, or manage a large-scale release.What plans have access to Projects?All users have access to the free tier of GitHub Issues and Projects. For more information about paid tiers, see our pricing page.Will the new Projects experience be available in GitHub Enterprise Server?Yes!

          One of the big benefits of using GitHub for CI/CD and security automation is that we don’t have to build, deploy, or maintain additional tools because they’re built-in to GitHub. That means developers can spend less time managing tools and more time writing code, which is how they’d prefer to spend their time.

            About The ReadME Project
            Coding is usually seen as a solitary activity, but it’s actually the world’s largest community effort led by open source maintainers, contributors, and teams. These unsung heroes put in long hours to build software, fix issues, field questions, and manage communities.
            The ReadME Project is part of GitHub’s ongoing effort to amplify the voices of the developer community. It’s an evolving space to engage with the community and explore the stories, challenges, technology, and culture that surround the world of open source.

GitHub Copilot functionality works in code editors regardless of code hosting platform. Some features are enhanced with the use of GitHub because Copilot can directly draw context and knowledge from repositories, pull requests, issues, and other data structures in the GitHub platform.
Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models. 
Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations. With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?Yes.

          I'd like to applaud our engineer for how he exceptionally responded to our query. This ticket was not a simple, one-answer investigation and I was very happy with how he explored multiple angles to investigate.

          Our engineer was super helpful and spot on with figuring out the problem. The steps he suggested helped me figure out the problem quickly. Kudos!

          Choosing your plan


    
  
    
      
      
        What is escalation and incident management?
      
    
    
      Escalation and incident management is the ability to escalate ticket progression in the GitHub support portal. After someone escalates a ticket, Support Incident Coordinators orchestrate all necessary parties to resolve the ticket. Additionally, Senior Escalation Engineers (SEEs) facilitate GitHub-internal technical communications and liaise with the rest of GitHub to improve the support team’s capability in similar future circumstances.
      
    
  


    
  
    
      
      
        What is incident response management?
      
    
    
      Incident response management helps manage the technical resources needed for case resolution. Support Incident Coordinators are available for incident response management 24/7.
      
    
  


    
  
    
      
      
        What are my SLAs for initial response?
      
    
    
      GitHub Premium Support and GitHub Premium Plus Support customers have SLAs. For urgent priority tickets, your SLA guarantees a 30-minute initial response time, which includes troubleshooting. For high priority tickets, your SLA provides a four-hour initial response time.
      
    
  


    
  
    
      
      
        What’s included in initial troubleshooting?
      
    
    
      For initial troubleshooting, the assigned Premium Support Engineer/Customer Reliability Engineer will review and acknowledge your ticket. To better understand the issue and start troubleshooting, the engineer may ask for additional information such as screenshots, error messages, log files, diagnostics files, support bundles, or the output of specific console commands. They may also collaborate with others in support, engineering, or in the regional incident commander.
If a callback was requested, the engineer will determine if screen sharing is the most effective way to drive ticket resolution. If so, they will invite you to join a screen-sharing session.
      
    
  


    
  
    
      
      
        How do I get health check reports?
      
    
    
      GitHub Premium Support and GitHub Premium Plus Support customers are entitled to unlimited automated health check reports. Additionally, GitHub Premium Plus Support customers can request quarterly enhanced health checks with findings, interpretations, and recommendations from a Customer Reliability Engineer (CRE).
      
    
  


    
  
    
      
      
        What is crisis prevention?
      
    
    
      Crisis prevention allows GitHub Enterprise Server customers to prepare for — and experience — an incident without risk. Your Customer Reliability Engineer (CRE) guides your team through an incident simulation in a safe and controlled environment.
Crisis Prevention consists of up to four sessions about reliability best practices, preparing for a potential incident, and efficiently interacting with GitHub Support. After the incident simulation, your CRE will run a detailed retrospective, uncovering lessons learned and improvement suggestions for the future.
      
    
  


    
  
    
      
      
        How long does GitHub Premium Support take?
      
    
    
      GitHub Premium Support and GitHub Premium Plus Support Plus customers have service-level agreements (SLAs) for initial response. For urgent priority tickets, the initial response SLA guarantees a 30-minute initial response time, which includes troubleshooting. For high-priority tickets, the initial response SLA provides a four-hour time.
We currently do not provide estimates for time to resolution, as the complexity of tickets varies. However, we review these metrics on a regular basis and reduce times whenever possible.
      
    
  


    
  
    
      
      
        How do I resolve a problem in GitHub Enterprise?

If you have GitHub Premium Support or GitHub Premium Plus Support, you can submit a ticket online.

        What virtual trainings are available with GitHub Premium Plus Support and who can participate?
      
    
    
      Customers get access to one virtual training class per year. Topics include:

GitHub for developers
GitHub for admins (Server)
GitHub for admins (Cloud)
GitHub for non-developers
GH API Training
GH Actions Fundamentals
GH Actions Intermediate
GH Copilot Fundamentals
GH Copilot Intermediate
GH Copilot Administration & Security
GitHub Enterprise Implementation (Cloud)

We recommend limiting training sessions to a maximum of 16 participants to ensure an optimal provider-to-participant ratio and a high-quality delivery experience. However, in specific cases where it makes sense, we can accommodate up to 20–25 participants while maintaining our commitment to delivering a valuable training experience for your team.
      
    
  


    
  
    
      
      
        What value will I get by upgrading to GitHub Premium Plus Support?
      
    
    
      GitHub Premium Plus Support customers get an assigned Customer Reliability Engineer (CRE), quarterly enhanced health checks, access to crisis prevention, technical advisory hours, and many additional benefits, which you can review in our plan comparison table.
      
    
  


    
  
    
      
      
        What’s the benefit of having a Customer Reliability Engineer (CRE) over a Premium Support Engineer?
      
    
    
      A CRE knows your customer account in detail and can help you expedite case resolution faster than a Premium Support Engineer.
      
    
  


    
  
    
      
      
        Since I get GitHub Enterprise Support for free, why should I upgrade to GitHub Premium Support?
      
    
    
      Most customers upgrade to GitHub Premium Support because they need initial response SLAs for urgent and high priority requests, phone support, screen share support for critical issues, and health checks.

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
                            Preamble
  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license forsoftware and other kinds of works.
  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designedto take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom toshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains freesoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use theGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also toany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it toyour programs, too.
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, notprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that youhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge forthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if youwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in newfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.
  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying youthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you havecertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or ifyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whethergratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the samefreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receiveor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so theyknow their rights.
  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this Licensegiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explainsthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' andauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked aschanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously toauthors of previous versions.
  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or runmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturercan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim ofprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematicpattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals touse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, wehave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for thoseproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, westand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versionsof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.States should not allow patents to restrict development and use ofsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish toavoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program couldmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures thatpatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution andmodification follow.
                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS
  0. Definitions.
  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds ofworks, such as semiconductor masks.
  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under thisLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the workin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of anexact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of theearlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work basedon the Program.
  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, withoutpermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable forinfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on acomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,distribution (with or without modification), making available to thepublic, and in some countries other activities as well.
  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables otherparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user througha computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visiblefeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to theextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey thework under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  Ifthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as amenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
  1. Source Code.
  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the workfor making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-sourceform of a work.
  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an officialstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case ofinterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one thatis widely used among developers working in that language.
  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, otherthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form ofpackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that MajorComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with thatMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which animplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used toproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means allthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executablework) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts tocontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work'sSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available freeprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities butwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Sourceincludes interface definition files associated with source files forthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamicallylinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,such as by intimate data communication or control flow between thosesubprograms and other parts of the work.
  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that userscan regenerate automatically from other parts of the CorrespondingSource.
  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is thatsame work.
  2. Basic Permissions.
  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term ofcopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the statedconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimitedpermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running acovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given itscontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges yourrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do notconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remainsin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purposeof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide youwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply withthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you donot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered worksfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your directionand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies ofyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely underthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10makes it unnecessary.
  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technologicalmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, orsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of suchmeasures.
  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbidcircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumventionis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect tothe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation ormodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work'susers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention oftechnological measures.
  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as youreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously andappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;keep intact all notices stating that this License and anynon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give allrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications toproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under theterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified    it, and giving a relevant date.
    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is    released under this License and any conditions added under section    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to    "keep intact all notices".
    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your    work need not make them do so.
  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independentworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are notused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's usersbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered workin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the otherparts of the aggregate.
  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the termsof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey themachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,in one of these ways:
    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium    customarily used for software interchange.
    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord    with subsection 6b.
    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no    charge under subsection 6d.
  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excludedfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not beincluded in conveying the object code work.
  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means anytangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporationinto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particularproduct received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to atypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the statusof the particular user or of the way in which the particular useractually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A productis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantialcommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses representthe only significant mode of use of the product.
  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to installand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product froma modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information mustsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified objectcode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely becausemodification has been made.
  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, orspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs aspart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of theUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for afixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), theCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompaniedby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not applyif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to installmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work hasbeen installed in ROM).
  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include arequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updatesfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or forthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to anetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially andadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules andprotocols for communication across the network.
  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,in accord with this section must be in a format that is publiclydocumented (and with an implementation available to the public insource code form), and must require no special password or key forunpacking, reading or copying.
  7. Additional Terms.
  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of thisLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shallbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extentthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissionsapply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separatelyunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed bythis License without regard to the additional permissions.
  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your optionremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part ofit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their ownremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may placeadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material youadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders ofthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal    Notices displayed by works containing it; or
    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or    authors of the material; or
    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on    those licensors and authors.
  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "furtherrestrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as youreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it isgoverned by this License along with a term that is a furtherrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document containsa further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under thisLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the termsof that license document, provided that the further restriction doesnot survive such relicensing or conveying.
  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, youmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of theadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicatingwhere to find the applicable terms.
  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in theform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;the above requirements apply either way.
  8. Termination.
  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expresslyprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate ormodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights underthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the thirdparagraph of section 11).
  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then yourlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly andfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyrightholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable meansprior to 60 days after the cessation.
  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder isreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of theviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you havereceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from thatcopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days afteryour receipt of the notice.
  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate thelicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you underthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanentlyreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the samematerial under section 10.
  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive orrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered workoccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmissionto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate ormodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you donot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating acovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automaticallyreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify andpropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsiblefor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of anorganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing anorganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a coveredwork results from an entity transaction, each party to thattransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whateverlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or couldgive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of theCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, ifthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of therights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you maynot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise ofrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging thatany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering forsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
  11. Patents.
  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under thisLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  Thework thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claimsowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired orhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permittedby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,but do not include claims that would be infringed only as aconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  Forpurposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grantpatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements ofthis License.
  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-freepatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, tomake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify andpropagate the contents of its contributor version.
  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any expressagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not tosue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to aparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce apatent against the party.
  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyoneto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through apublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be soavailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of thepatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a mannerconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patentlicense to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you haveactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying thecovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered workin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in thatcountry that you have reason to believe are valid.
  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction orarrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, acovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the partiesreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modifyor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent licenseyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the coveredwork and works based on it.
  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include withinthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or isconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that arespecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a coveredwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that isin the business of distributing software, under which you make paymentto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveyingthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of theparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatorypatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered workconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarilyfor and in connection with specific products or compilations thatcontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limitingany implied license or other defenses to infringement that mayotherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement orotherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do notexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey acovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under thisLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you maynot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate youto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you conveythe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and thisLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you havepermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensedunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a singlecombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of thisLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to thecombination as such.
  14. Revised Versions of this License.
  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions ofthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions willbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail toaddress new problems or concerns.
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If theProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU GeneralPublic License "or any later version" applies to it, you have theoption of following the terms and conditions either of that numberedversion or of any later version published by the Free SoftwareFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of theGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever publishedby the Free Software Foundation.
  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which futureversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy'spublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes youto choose that version for the Program.
  Later license versions may give you additional or differentpermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on anyauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow alater version.
  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BYAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHTHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTYOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULARPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAMIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OFALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
  16. Limitation of Liability.
  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITINGWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYSTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANYGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THEUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OFDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRDPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OFSUCH DAMAGES.
  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability providedabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximatesan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with theProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies acopy of the Program in return for a fee.
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatestpossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make itfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safestto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectivelystate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at leastthe "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or    (at your option) any later version.
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the    GNU General Public License for more details.
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a shortnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriateparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commandsmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".
  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your programinto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, youmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications withthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser GeneralPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n\n\n\nxn-intenton-z2a
