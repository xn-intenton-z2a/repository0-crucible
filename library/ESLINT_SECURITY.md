Its detailed rule set covers potential code injection, unsafe regex, and improper use of Node.js APIs, ensuring robust source code scrutiny.

## Normalised Extract
Summary: The ESLint Plugin Security tool enhances application safety by providing specific rules to detect vulnerabilities. 

Table of Contents:
1. Installation
2. Configuration
3. Rules Overview
4. Testing & Developer Guide

1. Installation: Use npm or yarn to add the package as a dev dependency. Installation instructions are clearly provided with commands and package names.

2. Configuration: Two approaches are supported: modern flat config requiring eslint >= v8.23.0, and legacy .eslintrc setups, each with code samples and setup guidelines.

3. Rules Overview: Each rule targets common vulnerabilities such as eval misuse and non-literal require. Detailed descriptions, warnings, and recommendations are provided.

4. Testing & Developer Guide: The guide underscores the importance of adding tests for new rules and following custom ESLint setups, with commands like `npm test` validating code quality.

## Supplementary Details
Latest information indicates the repository adheres to the Apache-2.0 license. The project released version v3.0.1 on June 14, 2024, emphasizing community contributions via GitHub pull requests and integrating continuous integration practices such as GitHub Actions.

## Reference Details
Extracted technical details include installation commands (npm install --save-dev eslint-plugin-security, yarn add --dev eslint-plugin-security), and configuration code snippets for both flat and legacy ESLint setups. API signatures involve requiring the module in configuration files (e.g., const pluginSecurity = require('eslint-plugin-security');) and extending recommended settings. Detailed rule breakdown covers specific vulnerabilities such as detect-bidi-characters, detect-eval-with-expression, and detect-non-literal-require with explicit alerts and warnings. Best practices from the content stress thorough testing (using npm test and custom linting scripts) and code reviews through GitHub pull requests to ensure adherence to security standards.
